Abstract    :
              9870226  Otte     Taxonomy provides the core knowledge-base on which all
              discussion of biological diversity hinges.  Currently only the most superficial
              kinds of inventories and monitoring are possible because relatively few species
              are known (it is estimated that less than 13% of the species on Earth have yet
              been described), and because knowledge on those that have been named is so
              difficult to obtain from the literature.  There is no comprehensive catalog of
              the 1.75 million known species, and 90% of the described species have never
              been included in regional accounts of biotas, or in identification manuals or
              modern monographs.   In this project we will provide the scientific community
              with a complete internet-accessible catalog to all of the approximately 40,000
              species of orthopteroid insects (an economically important group of insects
              that includes grasshoppers, crickets, mantids, and cockroaches)
              (http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/Orthoptera/).  The website constitutes a complete
              and fully referenced synonymic catalog to all species and subspecies of the
              world.  It includes pictorial aids and species-specific sounds to aid in
              identification, and it will soon contain easy to follow pictorial keys to the
              major groups.  It will be useful to anyone wishing to determine any species in
              this assemblage from anywhere on earth, and will be especially useful to those
              engaged in biodiversity surveys and monitoring.  It will be possible for anyone
              with access to the web to reach into the world's great museums to view type
              specimens, exemplars, and diagnostic images from the original literature, and
              to listen to samples from their sound archives.
