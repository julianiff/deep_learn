Abstract    :
                Abstract  CTS-9870015  R.E. Apfel, Yale University    A novel apparatus for
              studying the behavior of clusters/arrays of drops/particles levitated by
              combined acoustic and electric fields is proposed.  A cluster of droplets may
              be made to coalesed into larger drops, particle arrays may be arranged in
              layers, and other three-dimensional cluster configurations may be produced by
              varying the acoustic and electric field intensities.  Individual
              droplets/particles will be probed by various techniques.  Measurements on such
              configurations will provide fundamental information on drop evaporation,
              nucleation, clustering of charged and uncharged particles, combustion, cloud
              behavior and other phenomena.    Particle shape and size distribution may be
              modified during experiments.    The work will have relevance to cluster
              dynamics and particle/droplet interaction mechanisms, and practical application
              to spray, combustion, coating and atmospheric processes.  ***
