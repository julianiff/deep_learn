Experimental Software Systems:  Software Fondations for
              Experiment Management

The development of a high-performance parallel and
              networked system is an evolutionary process.  Systems start with models and
              simulations and progress through a sequence of implementation steps.  At each
              step, the key question is how and how much did the performance change?  This
              question is important when we are comparing implementation to models or
              simulations, and when we change an implementation to run with a different
              algorithm, library, language, number of processors, type of network, input,
              work load, or scheduling algorithm.  This project is developing an Experiment
              Management facility, called X-Man, to provide an infrastructure to directly
              attack these issues.  This infrastructure will be of immediate use by system
              developers, and those developing models and simulation environments.  It will
              provide a point of exchange, comparison, and reference for cooperating
              development groups, supporting collaborative, geographically distributed
              development.  The benefits from X-Man include: (1) Directly support the code
              development process, providing programmers with concrete understanding of
              program evolution. (2) Change benchmarking from an ad- hoc activity to one with
              a quantitative, well-defined structure. (3) Provide both infrastructure and
              analysis to support model and simulation validation. (4) A framework to
              evaluate the effect of dynamic systems, analyzing behavioral differences caused
              by adaptive algorithms.
