Abstract    :
              The Hope College Nuclear Group has begun to take advantage of the
              Radioactive
Nuclear  Beams (RNB) available at Notre Dame and Michigan State
              University. 
Specifically, this  project will undertake measurements of the 3n
              decay channel
following the fusion of 6He  with 209Bi to study the effects of
              the
neutron-skin character of  6He, the fusion cross  section of  8Be with
              28Si to
examine the effects of a possible proton-skin, and the 
              electromagnetic
dissociation of fissile systems induced by RNB.  This proposal
              will also 
support collaborative participation in RNB experiments proposed by
              others from
Notre  Dame, Oak Ridge National Labs, and Michigan State
              University. 
Undergraduate students  from Hope College will participate in all
              aspects of
the experiments.  Our experience over  the years demonstrates
              that
undergraduate research enhances a student's education and  preparation.
