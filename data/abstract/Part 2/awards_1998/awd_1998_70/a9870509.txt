Abstract    :
                    9870509  Zerva  A POWRE award will support for one year the conduct of
              research  by PI at California Institute of Technology, where she will 
              collaborate with Prof. J.L. Beck.  The joint study will combine  the PI's
              expertise in identifying the causes of spatial  variability in seismic ground
              motions with Dr. Beck's expertise  in statistical system identification.  The
              spatial variation of  ground motions may affect the response of lifelines, such
              as  bridges and pipelines, beyond the loads expected from uniform  motions. 
              Existing models are based, generally, on regression  analyses of data recorded
              at a single site and for a single  event.  Thus, they cannot readily be applied
              to different sites  and events, which limits their usefulness.  In order to
              overcome  this limitation the present study will incorporate physical 
              parameters in the spatial variability model, parameters which are  estimated,
              where necessary, using system identification.  The  approach will embed the
              system identification scheme in a  statistical frame work, that accounts for
              uncertainties in the  model parameters and in the predictions from the model
              itself.  A  Bayesian scheme will be used, allowing the predictive 
              probabilities to be updated with additional information from  various sites and
              events, until the models stabilize or converge.   The project will enhance the
              PI's career by broadening her  research horizons, specifically in the areas of
              statistical  system identification, reliability-based optimal design and 
              robust structural control.  She expects to apply this knowledge  in future
              research related to the safety and reliability of the  older and decaying
              infrastructure of the East Coast, where her  home institution is located.  ***
