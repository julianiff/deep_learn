Abstract    :
                        Szenes  9870053      The project is concerned with topological
              invariants of special spaces arising both in algebraic geometry and quantum
              physics: the moduli spaces of parabolic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces. 
              A detailed geometric analysis of the intersection numbers of these moduli
              spaces will be pursued by relating them to certain problems of the theory of
              hyperplane arrangements. A new algebro-geometric model of topological quantum
              field theories will be studied and relations with deformation quantization will
              be explored.      This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. 
              Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
              which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century, partly due
              to some recently discovered surprizing connections with quantum physics. In its
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
              equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
              from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
              application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer
              science, and robotics.
