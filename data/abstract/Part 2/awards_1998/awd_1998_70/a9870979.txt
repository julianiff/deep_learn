Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to complete a critical edition, with English
              translation and scholarly annotation, of the first three books of the medieval
              Latin version of Alhacen's `Treatise on Optics.`  Composed in Arabic in the
              early eleventh century, this treatise was rendered into Latin some two
              centuries later, under the title `De aspectibus.`  In that form it quickly
              became a canonical source for optical thought in the Latin West, inspiring a
              series of important derivative works and serving as the primary teaching text
              for optics until the early seventeenth century.  Both directly and indirectly,
              this work played a critical role in the formation of medieval and Renaissance
              ideas about light, color and visual representation.  The critical edition will
              make this theoretically-oriented portion of Alhacen's work accessible in
              definitive form not only to specialists in the history of science but also to
              those with more general interests in medieval and Renaissance intellectual and
              cultural history.
