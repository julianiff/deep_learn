POWRE:  Fractal Modulation
              Using Waveless for Digital Communications

This is a startup research effort
              for the PI who has just entered academia.  The research adapts doctoral work of
              the PI to complement on-going activities in wireless at VA Tech.   The
              objective is to investigate several problems involving fractal modulation.  The
              PI intends to explore: the extent to which fractal modulation is optimum for
              the unknown duration-bandwidth channel; the notion of capacity for this
              channel; the combination of fractal modulation and direct-sequence
              spread-spectrum techniques; and, the effect of compactly supported wavelets on
              the simulation of a fractal modulation system.
