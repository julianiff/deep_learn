Abstract    :
              9870785  Fredrickson  This is a theoretical grant in polymer science.  The focus
               is on the time-dependent structural evolution properties of  multicomponent
              polymeric systems.  Projects will include (1)  macromolecular solution
              templating and (2) stress-  concentration coupling and phase separation
              kinetics of  linear/branched polymer blends.  In each area, the proposed 
              research is designed to elucidate fundamental knowledge that  will guide
              practical macromolecular materials design,  optimization, and processing.  This
              theoretical program will  be coordinated with experimental activities underway
              at  Santa Barbara and Minnesota.  %%%  This is a theoretical grant in polymer
