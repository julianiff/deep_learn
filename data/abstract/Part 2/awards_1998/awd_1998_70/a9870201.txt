Abstract    :
              9870201  Johansen    Microbiotic soil crusts are assemblages of cyanobacteria,
              eukaryotic algae,   fungi, lichens, and bryophytes that play an important role
              in healthy   semiarid and arid ecosystems. Despite their prominant ecological
              role, a   clear understanding of the species composition of microbiotic crusts
              is   lacking.  Over the course of a 36-month period, thirty locations with
              known   mature microbiotic crust communities throughout intermountain western
              North   America, and representing diverse climatic and geological regions, will
              be   sampled in order to: (1) characterize the species composition of the  
              microbiotic crust organisms. This includes an inventory of the species of  
              cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, lichens, and mosses found in the sampled  
              microbiotic crusts and descriptions of new species that may be encountered;  
              (2) produce a data base that includes species lists, descriptions, images,  
              and information on the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils at  
              each locality; (3) produce an electronic version of the data base that will  
              be accessible on the World Wide Web; (4) archive soil samples that will serve  
              as a resource to biologists interested in organisms not included in the  
              survey; (5) identify locations of high diversity that should be targeted for  
              more in-depth study. This project is the first comprehensive study of  
              microbiotic crust organisms, and as such it will provide a resource and  
              database that potentially will be of use to ecologists, systematists, and  
              rangeland managers for many years after the completion of the project.
