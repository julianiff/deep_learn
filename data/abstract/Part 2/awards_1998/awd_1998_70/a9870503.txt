Abstract    :
              This is a study of the role of elections in democratic transitions. 
              Specifically, the investigator wishes to look at how the process of repeated
              elections affected the progress of democratization in the Russian Federation. 
              Her research will explain national-level electoral outcomes (party
              organizations and aggregate vote totals) in terms of individual-level factors. 
              Using data she is developing from a survey of Russian candidates for national
              parliamentary office from 1989 to 1999, she will test propositions on ambition
              theory, party formation, and the political implications of election laws.  This
              project has implications beyond the study of democratization and elections in
              Russia.  Elections have been an important element in many democratic
              transitions.  Yet the relationship between electoral competition and democratic
              consolidation is not well understood.  In addition, a number of regimes, from
              Japan to Hungary, have recently adopted mixed electoral systems to govern their
              electoral process.  The investigator agues that the effects of these
              institutions are not consistent with expectations based on conventional
              theoretical frameworks.  Her insights on the Russian case will suggest a
              framework incorporating institutional and contextual elements.  In future work,
              she will apply this framework in cross-national comparisons.  Her goal is to
              develop a systematic micro-level theory that explains variation in nation-level
              outcomes conducted under mixed electoral systems.  With this POWRE Visiting
              Professor award, the investigator will gain and enhance skills in quantitative
              methods and political economy at Harvard University and she will collect data
              in the Russian Federation.  Residence as a visiting professor will contribute
              to her career development in a number of ways.  The opportunity to add new
              methodological and analytical skills will enable her to attain concrete
              research and teaching goals such as expanding her research agenda to
              incorporate multi-country studies and contributing to the graduate education of
              non-area specialists.  The retraining program will enhance her contributions to
              the larger debates in the field of comparative politics.
