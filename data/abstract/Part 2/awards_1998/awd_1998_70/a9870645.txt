Abstract    :
              Kerkhof
A direct way of identifying novel genes being expressed in mixed
              culture or the environment is needed.  The goal of this SGER is to adapt and
              verify the differential display (DD) method (Liang and Pardee, 1992),
              originally developed for eukaryotic systems, for use in microbial biology
              research.  A recently designed priming set based on E. coli coding sequence
              (Fislage et al., 1996) will be tested using other Proteobacteria and the
              nitrous oxide reductase (nos) gene as a target.  Alternatively, a new priming
              set for DD will be designed using the complete genomes of various eubacteria
              available in Genbank and other repositories.  This research represents one of
              the only ways to discover novel genes in consortia or the environment that can
              not be detected using traditional approaches.
