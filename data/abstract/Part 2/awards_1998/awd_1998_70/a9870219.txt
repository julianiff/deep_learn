Abstract    :
              9870219  Iliffe    Within the last 20 years, explorations by cave divers have
              resulted in the discovery of extensive, entirely submerged cave systems
              containing brackish to fully marine waters.  Such caves have been termed
              "anchialine," derived from Greek meaning "near the sea."  The anchialine cave
              habitat is comparable to the deep sea hydrothermal vents and the tropical
              forest canopy in representing one of Earth's last faunistic frontiers. 
              Anchialine  caves serve as refugia to relic "living fossil" organisms and to
              species closely related to deep sea taxa.  Typical depigmented, eye-reduced
              anchialine taxa characteristically include remipedes, thermosbaenaceans,
              copepods, ostracods, amphipods, shrimp and polychaetes.  Anomalous
              biogeographic relationships between cave species on widely separated oceanic
              islands suggest dispersal by plate tectonics or even global faunal  connections
              via crevicular habitats on sea mount slopes and mid-ocean ridges.     We will
              conduct a month-long expedition to faunistically rich but relatively unstudied
              anchialine caves on Grand Bahama and Andros Islands, Bahamas.  Specialized cave
              diving techniques will be used for a broad based biotic survey of these caves. 
              The proposed research will involve collection and identification of cave fauna
              and flora as well as investigation of the physical and chemical characteristics
              of the marine caves. Since many anchialine cave species are known only from a
              single cave or cave system, pollution or destruction of caves can result in the
              extinction of entire species.  This study should result in the discovery and
              documentation of taxonomically and ecologically significant organisms from
              potentially endangered habitats.
