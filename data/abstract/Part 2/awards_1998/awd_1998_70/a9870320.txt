Abstract    :
              This project aims at developing a unified and integrated theory of implicit
              (i.e. machine independent) computational complexity, and applying it in
              programming languages, program design and development, and feasible
              mathematics.  The project proposes that implicit computational complexity can
              be rooted in the spectrum of weak set existence (i.e. comprehension )
              principles.  By transfer principles, such as proof theoretic conservation, data
              ramification, Schoenfinkel-Curry-Howard morphisms, and boundedness, one obtains
              known and new characterizations of major computational complexity classes by
              methods of proof theory, function algebras, lambda calculi, and finite model
              theory.     A unified implicit computational complexity theory would enable the
              development of software environments for program derivation and verification,
              which will assure that the computer programs produced are not only demonstrably
              correct, but can also be executed within feasible computation time and memory. 
              Thus, the proposed work would bring abstract conceptualizations, rooted in
              philosophy, to bear on concrete applications of immediate technological value.
