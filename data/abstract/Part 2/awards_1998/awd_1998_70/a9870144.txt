Abstract    :
              9870144  Motyka    A major question in active tectonics relates to the
              relationship between glaciation and active fault motion.  Can the changing
              thickness of ice caps trigger tectonic motions or even earthquakes?    This
              project outlines a work plan that will go a long way to discriminating between
              uplift due to active tectonic processes and to deglaciation.   In this project
              several methods will be employed to obtain uplift histories.  These include
              stratigraphy, dendrochronology, and GPS measurements that will reoccupy tidal
              benchmarks. This proposal will provide the data base necessary to discriminate
              between glacial and tectonic deformation, and allow strain and deformation
              partitioning in this region of Alaska. If successful it will also provide a
              longer history of deformation and the earthquake cycle in Alaska which can be
              compared to other troubling quiet zones of Cascadia.
