Abstract    :
              9870475  Springer  This grant is made under the NSF "Professional Opportunities
              for Women in Research and Education" program.  It will provide funds to support
              a six-month visit by the PI to an international center of research in her field
              (the Institute for Nuclear Theory at the University of Washington).  The PI
              will be in charge of one study program at INT, and will also continue her own
              research in the theory of elementary particles.  This will be a significant
              advance in her career.
