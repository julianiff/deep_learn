Abstract    :
              9870784  HALFTER   In the developing nervous system, axons must  often establish
              contact with specific targets by complicated  routes.  Despite considerable
              progress in understanding how axons  make navigational choices, the mechanisms
              and molecular components  that can precisely account for the specificity of
              axonal wiring  are still largely unknown.  In the current project, Dr. Halfter 
              plans to continue his research on the question of how optic axons  from the eye
              are guided to grow towards the optic disc and cross  to the other side of the
              brain at the optic chiasm, and from  there, to form synapses with the correct
              parts of the tectum,  their initial target in the brain.  Previous work in Dr.
              Halfter's  laboratory has shown that membrane and extracellular matrix 
              proteins on cells in the path of growing retinal axons are likely  to act as
              intermediary targets.  They have recently isolated an  unknown cell-surface
              protein called the ID10 antigen which is a  candidate guidance molecule.  The
              first goal of the new research  will be to molecularly identify this protein
              and characterize its  function in axon guidance.  A second aim of this research
              is to  investigate how gradients of substances that either attract or  repel
              growing axons can precisely guide axonal growth.  For this  aim, Dr. Halfter
              has developed an in vitro system for producing  gradients of suspected
              attractive or repellent molecules.  The  third part of this project will take a
              molecular approach to  identifying new candidate molecules for axonal guidance
              by their  differential expression in retinal ganglion cells from different 
              locations in the eye.  These studies will contribute to a general 
              understanding of the mechanisms of axon guidance, and provide new  methodology
              for assaying the effects of candidate molecules.
