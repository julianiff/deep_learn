Theoretical methods will be used to study properties of mantle
              phases to better understand the physical properties of the Earths mantle and to
              guide experimental studies.  Important problems that will be addressed include
              study of the behavior of transition metal ions such as ferrous and ferric iron
              and minor elements such as Co, Ni, and Mn in lower mantle minerals such as
              magnesiowustite and perovskite; design and interpretation of x-ray
              spectroscopic experiments on high pressure minerals to understand their
              electronic properties at high pressures in the Earth's mantle; diffusion and
              rheology of  perovskite and magnesiowustite at high pressures and temperatures;
               high-pressure high-temperature elasticity of perovskite and  magnesiowustite;
              high pressure melting; and solubility of  rare gases in oxide melts and solids
              at high pressures.  This work will give important predictions for geophysics
              and geochemistry that will aid understanding of the evolution and dynamics of
              the Earth and terrestrial planets.  It will give predictions of mineral
              properties in the experimentally difficult regime of the high pressures and
              temperatures of the deep Earth and will increase our understanding of
              experimental observations of mineral behavior.
