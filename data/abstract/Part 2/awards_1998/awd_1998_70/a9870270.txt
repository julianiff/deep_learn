Abstract    :
              9870270  To test a piece of software, a set of possible inputs is  selected, the
              software is executed on each of them, and the  results are checked against the
              specification. This research  addresses the following two issues involving the
              development of  cost-effective testing techniques: evaluation of the 
              effectiveness of existing testing techniques and development of  efficient
              methods for checking test results against their  specifications. The first
              provides data to help practitioners  make informed choices between competing
              testing techniques; the  second lowers the cost of testing certain types of
              programs,  allowing more thorough testing within a given budget. The  research
              on evaluation of cost-effectiveness of testing  techniques is based on a
              probabilistic approach, since most  testing techniques involve some random
              choice among alternatives.  Models of cost are incorporated into several
              probabilistic  measures of effectiveness. The work on checking test results 
              focuses on testing data abstractions, an increasingly important  kind of
              program unit. New techniques for partially checking test  results are developed
              and their effectiveness is investigated  analytically and through 
              experimentation.***
