               The grant will allow the PIs to assess how calcium transporting proteins
              evolved.  The PIs will study the physiological function and molecular
              characterization of the calcium pump in transporting epithelia (gills,  kidney,
              gut) of an evolutionary continuum of related aquatic to semi-terrestrial crabs
              available in Brazil.  Crustaceans are used as a non-mammalian model system for
              the study of calcium balance due to the mineralization/demineralization
              processes that accompany their natural molting cycle.  The hypothesis is that
              during evolution from water onto land aquatic modes of Calcium uptake (across
              gills) become superseded by terrestrial modes (dietary intake across gut).  The
              specific objectives are to examine the Ca uptake proteins in the membrane of
              gill, kidney and gut in each crab as a function of (a) stage in the molting
              cycle and (b)  CA availability (water or dietary).  Methods will include making
              membrane vesicles (analogous to water filled balloons) to study Ca uptake in
              vitro as well as using molecular biology to clone and sequence tissue-specific
              genes.  Expression of the genes will be quantified during molting and as a
              function of Ca availability.  The Ca pump is fundamental to Ca homeostasis in
              all eukaryotic cells.  This research will delineate the evolution of this
              critical molecule over the past 600 million years.
