Abstract    :
              9870552  Narain  This grant is made under the NSF "Professional Opportunities
              for Women in Research and Education" program.  It will support a visiting
              professorship position for the PI, allowing her to spend 18 months at Boston
              University.  At BU, she will establish a collaboration with the particle
              physics group there, continuing her studies of the newly-found top quark.  In
              addition, the PI will teach several courses at BU.  This participation in
              academic research and teaching will advance her career significantly.
