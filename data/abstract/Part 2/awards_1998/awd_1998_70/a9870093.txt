Abstract    :
              A short-course will be offered whose primary focus is to assist faculty in
              gaining experience and knowledge about instructional strategies and procedures
              to improve the undergraduate educational experience of students in the
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with engineering programs. 
              The short-course is modeled after a National Science Foundation (NSF) faculty
              enhancement course at the United States Military Academy (USMA).    The project
              is based on the premise of adaptation adoption to promote the use of good ideas
              in an environment that recognizes the need for such a program.  The result will
              be a broader exposure to teacher training by engineering professors and, it is
              hoped, a faster growth in the dedication to teaching at all affected
              institutions of higher learning.    The project is intended to support the need
              of a separate and distinct teacher training program at the Historically Black
              Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with engineering programs, to demonstrate the
              ability to operate such a course at Tuskegee University, and the ability to
              adopt much of the program that was so successful at the United States Military
              Academy at West Point.
