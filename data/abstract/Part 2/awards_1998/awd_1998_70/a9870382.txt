Abstract    :
              Stewart  IBN 9870382      Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is the
              final  enzyme required  for synthesis of the stress hormone epinephrine. Recent
               studies indicate that the PNMT gene is expressed in  mammalian lymphoid
              organs, such as spleen, thymus and lymph  nodes, but it is unclear what types
              of cells in these organs  produce PNMT and whether the PNMT in these areas has
              other  functions in addition to synthesis of epinephrine.  Similarly, PNMT and
              epinephrine are found in the brains of  vertebrates, but the functions of
              epinephrine in the brain  have never been clarified. The goals of the proposed
              project  are to (1) identify cells that express the PNMT gene in the  central
              nervous system and lymphoid tissues of rats and  mice, (2) investigate the
              regulation of PNMT and epinephrine  in these areas and (3) explore model
              systems for studying  the function of epinephrine in these tissues.  These
              studies  will increase our understanding of the role of PNMT and  epinephrine
              in both the nervous system and the immune  system.  Because epinephrine is
              present in the vertebrate  brain and in immune cells of organisms as diverse as
               primates and molluscs, the findings will have broad  implications for
              regulatory mechanisms in many species.
