Abstract    :
              9870930  White  This investigator plans to study `stripes' which are  patterns
              of holes and spins observed in neutron scattering  experiments in some high
              temperature cuprate superconductors  using the density matrix renormalization
              group (DMRG)  developed by White.  The PI plans a large number of  "numerical
              experiments" on doped t-J ladder systems as large  as 16x8 that are aimed to
              answer questions such as: Does a  stripe have strong superconducting pairing
              correlations  along its length? At what dopings do stripes appear in two 
              dimensions? At low doping, what is the natural linear hole  density of a
              stripe?  How easily do pairs tunnel between  stripes? Does pair tunneling
              greatly enhance pairing? Do  stripes attract or repel each other? What does the
              Fermi  surface look like in a striped state? Are (1,1) stripes  stable?  The PI
              plans to enhance the DMRG and develop a method for  calculating dynamical
              quantities. Also extensions to three  band Hubbard models and one dimensional
              coupled electron-  phonon systems is planned with the aim of applying the DMRG 
              to organic conductors.  %%%  This award involves research on electronic
              properties of  materials in which strong electron-electron interactions are 
              important.  The focus of this effort is on high temperature  superconductors
              and related materials.  A method developed  by the PI that holds promise for
              significant advance will be  used and refined in this project which contains
              strong  computational components and algorithm development.
