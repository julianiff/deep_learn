Abstract    :
              The Department of Applied Mathematics of the University of Colorado Boulder will
              purchase SUN Microsystems hardware and associated software which will be used
              to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used in
              5 research projects, including computational problems related to: Wavelets and
              Fast Algorithms, Iterating Lie Point Symmetries, problems in geophysics,
              development of first order systems least squares for PDEs, and the dynamics of
              multidimensional mappings.
