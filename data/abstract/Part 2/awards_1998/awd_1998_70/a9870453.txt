Abstract    :
              9870453  McDonald  Dr. McDonald wishes to use a POWRE award to initiate a new
              area of research that will aid her in establishing an independent research
              activity.  The new area involves viral transfection of genes to plant cell
              suspension cultures.  Tobacco mosaic virus will be used to infect tobacco,
              tomato, and other plant cells.  Green fluorescent protein will be used to mark
              successful transfection.  The initial experiments will be run in test tubes and
              shake flasks and will be scalled-up to a 5L bioreactor if successful.  Dr.
              McDonald will develop new course material on plant cell culture and plant virus
              transfer of genes.  A case study on protein production and isolation from
              plants and plant cells will be developed for a senior chemical engineering
              design course.  ***
