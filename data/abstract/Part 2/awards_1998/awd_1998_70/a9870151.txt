Abstract    :
              AST 98-70151  Matthias Steinmetz    The PI is studying galaxy interactions and
              galaxy mergers.  Galaxy interactions and mergers can induce radical changes in
              the appearance of galaxies, and also may be the defining events for the star
              formation history in those galaxies.      The PI is using the hardware tool
              called GRAPE to run n-body simulations of interactions and mergers.  These
              simulations address (1) What is the most likely dynamical pre-history for
              ellipticals?  In particular, which fraction of them have formed from major
              mergers?  And (2) What are the cumulative effects of tidal interactions and
              minor mergers for a typical disk galaxy?  That is, what are the observable
              consequences of 'field harassment'?      Several factors have come together
              that promise significant progress in answering these questions.  There are
              numerical, high-resolution simulations of large scale structure that provide
              sensible initial conditions for galaxy merger.  There are definite predictions
              for the mass profile of the dark and the luminous matter.  Ultra-high
              resolutions simulations using GRAPE hardware make merger simulation surveys now
              feasible that involve a million particles each.  With new modeling techniques
              the PI is attempting to constrain the orbital anisotropies in elliptical
              galaxies.    The result of the project will be a set of simulated interaction
              histories for an ensemble of elliptical and spiral galaxies suitable for
              comparing with observations.  ***
