Abstract    :
                        This award will permit acquisition of a high-performance parallel
              computer to be housed in the Mathematical Sciences Department at Worcester
              Polytechnic Institute (WPI).  This acquisition will support research activities
              conducted by, among others, five department members; and also its broader
              impact.  The research activities involve a wide variety of areas in applied
              mathematics, computational modeling, numerical algorithms, and applied and
              computational statistics.  They interface strongly with other disciplines and
              institutions through applications and collaborations.  Specific areas include
              the following:  -Bayesian analysis of correlated categorical data models using
              scale mixtures of multivariate normal link functions.  -Enhanced methods for
              modeling and simulation of atmospheric flows, clouds and their radiative
              properties.  -Design of particulate suspensions for optimal dissipation of
              thermal energy.  -Modeling of blood flow coupled with stenosis (narrowing) in
              arteries.  -Numerical methods for large-scale nonlinear systems, with
              applications to fluid dynamics and reactive flows.
