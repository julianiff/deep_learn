               This project deals with the cohomology of noncompact locally symmetric 
              spaces.  In previous work, the investigator developed a micro-local  analogue
              of purity on compactifications of locally symmetric spaces  and used this to
              prove Rapoport's conjecture.  In the current project,  the investigator will
              apply this purity theory to study the relation  between the cohomology of a
              locally symmetric space and the cohomology  of its boundary strata.  One tool
              will be a weight spectral sequence  developed by the investigator which is
              based on the Langlands's  partition.  The objective is to understand from a
              more geometric  viewpoint the construction of cohomology using Eisenstein
              series and  the relation with L-functions.    Locally symmetric spaces occur
              naturally in many areas of mathematics  and theoretical physics, in particular,
              geometry and number theory.  In their most basic forms, geometry and number
              theory are considered  in high school:  the study of plane figures and the
              study of the whole  numbers.  These are two of the oldest fields in
              mathematics.  In the  modern perspective, geometry and number theory become
              intertwined as  part of the Langlands's program, the scene of some of the most 
              exciting current research of the past quarter-century.  Applications  of
              geometry and number theory abound, in particular in coding theory,  computing,
              and the study of symmetry of crystals, materials, and  biological structures.
