Abstract    :
              Modern computers rely on memory hierarchies (which consist of  disks,
              main-memory and hardware caches) for high performance and  low cost. Technology
              trends, however, have continued to increase  the access-time gaps between the
              layers.  The gaps threaten to  reduce the effectiveness of memory hierarchies
              unless novel  techniques can be found to improve hit ratios and data movement 
              efficiencies. The research focuses on three such techniques:  adaptive virtual
              memory, near-optimal page coloring, and coherence-  miss reduction.  Adaptive
              virtual memory targets the disk and main-  memory layers.  It improves
              performance by observing applications'  page fault patterns and adjusting page
              replacement and prefetching  policies accordingly, and by integrating dynamic
              swap allocation  with page managements. Near-optimal page coloring targets the
              main-  memory and hardware cache layers. It increases cache hit ratio by 
              carefully placing the pages into cache sets. The research studies  the
              theoretical aspects of the problem and designs practical  algorithms including
              profile-based optimizations based on the  theoretical foundation.Coherence-miss
              reduction targets multi-  processor caches.  It uses a database system as a
              case study to  identify common data structures and algorithms that  contribute
              the most to cache coherence misses, and design and  evaluate alternatives that
              perform better.Combined, the three  techniques promise to improve memory
              hierarchy performance  significantly.
