The QUEST Variability
              Survey

The QUEST (Quasar Equatorial Survey Team) is a collaboration among
              Yale University, the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia, the Universidad
              de Los Andes, and Indiana University.  The QUEST camera is a 4x4 array of
              2048x2048 CCDs mounted at the prime focus of the 1 meter Schmidt near MÚrida,
              Venezuela.  The field-of-view is 2.3 by 2.3 degrees.  The limiting magnitudes
              for a single scan are 21.5 magnitudes in the Visual, and 21.4 magnitudes in the
              Red.  

Dr. Schaefer is using the camera to follow the lightcurves of
              intermediate redshift supernovae.  The project anticipates a discovery of about
              30 supernova between redshifts of 0 and 0.1; about 210 supernova between
              redshifts of 0.1 and 0.2, and about 390 supernova between redshifts of 0.2 and
              0.3 over the next three years.  This type of supernova forms one of distance
              standards used to establish the distance scale (the Hubble constant, Ho ) of
              the universe to an estimated accuracy of +/- 0.01 magnitudes.
