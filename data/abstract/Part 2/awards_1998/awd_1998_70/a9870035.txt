The project is an investigation into the representation
              theory and cohomology of finite groups over fields of finite characteristic. 
              Of particular interest are the homological properties of representations which
              underline the basic module theory, and the structure of the cohomology ring of
              the group which acts on the fundamental homological constructions.  The
              proposer plans to continue his development of computer algebra systems for
              experimentation with modules, homomorphisms and group cohomology.

The field
              of group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and interacts with many
              other disciplines, for example physics and chemistry outside of mathematics,
              coding theory, number theory and geometry inside mathematics.  The
              investigator's particular area is a meld of representation theory, homological
              algebra and the use of computer techniques.
