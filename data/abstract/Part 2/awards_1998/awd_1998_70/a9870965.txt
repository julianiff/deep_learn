Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable The
              Center of Advanced Materials Processing (CAMP) at Clarkson   University to
              acquire a modern simultaneous static and dynamic light   scattering (SSDLS)
              instrument  with multi-angle fiber-optic detection and   a multi-channel
              correlator.  With these new capabilities, faculty will   investigate
              fundamental research topics including synthesis of inorganic   and organic
              colloidal particles (from nanometer to micrometer sized),   their
              characterization, investigation of their properties such as   aggregation
              phenomena, particle-surface interactions including   organization in thin films
              or transport in porous media, and finally   studies of surfactants, micellar
              solutions and microemulsions.    Static and dynamic light scattering techniques
              represent an indispensable   tool for the in-situ characterization of colloidal
              systems.  These   fundamental topics are closely tied to applied research
              spanning   ceramics, cosmetics, printing processes, construction of electronic,
                optical, electro-optical and magnetic devices, as well as medical or  
              environmental applications.
