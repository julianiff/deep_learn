Abstract    :
              The proposed project seeks to investigate the dynamics of the magnetotail by
              using a full 3-dimensional particle in cell (PIC) simulation code.  The
              proposed code is fully kinetic and includes all the physics contained in
              Maxwell's equations. The proposed research program would concentrate on the
              fundamental physical mechanisms of substorms.  The reconnection process and
              current disruption process(es) that are involved in substorms are inherently
              not amenable to solution by MHD simulations.  This proposal would therefore
              address an important topic that has not been addressed by any of the other GEM
              proposals
