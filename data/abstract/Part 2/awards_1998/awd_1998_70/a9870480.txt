Abstract    :
              Gartner  98-70480    This project describes sabbatical-year activities designed 
              to increase the PI's ability to integrate research in  Ecophysiology and wood
              science through research and visits  to labs.  The funded work involves
              research on evergreen oak  seedlings (Quercus ilex) in a glasshouse, asking how
              wood  accommodates the simultaneous needs to transport water and  to provide
              mechanical support.  The PI expects that  seedlings grown at high angels from
              vertical will use more  of their stem for specialized mechanical support, and
              thus  will have less cross-section available for water transport.  The PI will
              measure mechanical, hydraulic,  and growth  characteristics of the seedlings,
              followed by investigating  their wood anatomy.  If other funds are available,
              the PI  will supplement this research with a study of branches at  different
              angles on older trees in the field, and PI will  visit laboratories where other
              scientists are working with  trees and wood.  The site visits will help the PI
              put  research in context and increase the PI's knowledge of these  research
              areas in Europe.  Further understanding of how wood  functions in living trees
              will help the PIs understand  drought adaptations, and will give the PIs more
              predictive  power on how our forest manipulations will affect wood  quality for
              forest products.
