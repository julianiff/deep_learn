Abstract    :
                Despite much study on animal foraging behavior, very little is known about how
              animals make decisions about how to travel to and visit discrete, renewing food
              patches (such as nectar in flowers or fruit in trees).  Answering these
              questions is of interest to human geography (the problem is very much like the
              famous 'traveling salesman problem'), conservation and habitat management (the
              effectiveness of animals as pollinators and seed dispersers depends strongly on
              their movement patterns), and to those interested in the evolution of social
              behavior (how individuals forage in groups determines the degree of food
              competition, which can act as a primary limit on group size).  This proposal
              extends previous field experiments on capuchin monkeys, in which I studied
              their movements through an array of equally-valuable food sites, made of wooden
              platforms provisioned with fruit.  The monkeys seem to use a simple rule to
              decide where to move next: 'Go to the nearest unused resource that lies ahead
              of you'. The specific goals of this study are to validate this rule using
              another study group and to learn what rules these monkeys use in more general
              and natural choices, including those between richer versus closer feeding sites
              and between more clustered versus more isolated feeding sites.
