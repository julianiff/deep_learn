Abstract    :
              9870386  Barron  This POWRE proposal is from a very new educator and one who
              could profit substantially from an award.  the research involves the synthesis
              and evaluation of a novel class of peptides where the normal alkyl chain
              attached to the alpha-carbon is instead attached to the amide nitrogen.  The
              synthesis of these amino acids is easier than conventional amino acids, a
              broader range of these glycine derivitives is possible, and the resultant
              polymers are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis.  The primary emphasis will
              be on developing folding rules for these natural protein mimics.  The ease of
              synthesis will facilitate the study.  The new class of polypeptoids has
              interesting potential applications as biomaterials.  ***
