Abstract    :
              9870233  Rosenberg    The terrestrial mollusk and millipede faunas of Jamaica
              will be intensively  sampled, along with other soil and leaf litter
              invertebrates. About 550  described species of snails and slugs are recorded
              from Jamaica, of which  505 (92%) are endemic, occurring nowhere else in the
              world. About 52  described species of millipedes are recorded, of which 48
              (92%) are endemic.  The mollusk fauna of Jamaica is as diverse as any in the
              world, and it is  largely extant, unlike the mostly extinct terrestrial mollusk
              faunas of  oceanic islands in the Pacific. Although less than 20% of the
              original  forest cover of Jamaica remains, and deforestation continues, patches
              of  forest survive in many areas too rugged for agriculture, and secondary 
              forest has also grown in many abandoned plantations. Even among Jamaican  birds
              and reptiles, only a few species have gone extinct, so it may still be 
              possible to sample a large portion of the island's original invertebrate 
              fauna; however, the window of opportunity is rapidly disappearing.  
              Collections resulting from this research should at least double the  millipede
              fauna and increase the mollusk fauna by around 25%. Other  invertebrates will
              be made available to specialists who have agreed to study  Coleoptera
              (beetles), Orthoptera (crickets, cockroaches), Hymenoptera  (ants), Arachnida
              (spiders, scorpions, pseudoscorpions) and Onychophora  (peripatus). Residues
              from sorting will be preserved for further processing  for Acari (mites),
              Collembola (springtails), etc. The proposed research will  be the most
              extensive sampling of invertebrates ever performed in Jamaica,  with 180 field
              days over three years. Sampling methods will include hand  picking, leaf litter
              and soil sampling, and pitfall trapping. An estimated  1,000,000 specimens will
              be collected, including 14,000 lots of mollusks  (sorted to species) and 14,000
              lots of arthropods (sorted more or less to  ordinal level). Hundreds of new
              species are likely to be discovered.   Knowledge of  species-level biodiversity
              and site-specific ecological data  will provide a baseline for future
              researchers studying systematics and  evolution, faunal distribution patterns,
              factors influencing diversity, and  conservation and restoration biology.
              Collection data for all material will  be published on WWW, as will
              distribution maps and identification guides for  all known species of Jamaican
              terrestrial mollusks, and lists of other  Jamaican terrestrial invertebrates.
