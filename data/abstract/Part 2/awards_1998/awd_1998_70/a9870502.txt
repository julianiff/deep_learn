Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to validate observations of atmospheric
              temperature derived by occulation methods from data from the Global Positioning
              System.  Temperature profiles obtained from the GPS data show large-amplitued
              oscillations at heights between 10 km and 60 km.  The principal investigator
              will collaborate with colleagues at the University of Adelaide in Australia on
              a project to compare high-resolution sounding data from weather balloons with
              the data derived from the GPS to determine whether the temperature oscillations
              are truly indicators of atmospheric waves.  If these are truly waves, the GPS
              data provide an opportunity to monitor such waves globally.  It is important
              that we understand these waves because of their potential effects on climate
              and global circulation.
