     This GOALI Faculty in Industry award funds the
              development of a simulation model of continuous manufacturing systems during
              the startup phase. Engineering process control procedures based on first-order
              and second-order dynamic equations will be used in the model to make
              adjustments to the system. A statistical process control procedure based on
              autocorrelation will be used in the model to monitor the system. The developed
              simulation model will characterize the dynamic process and the noise process
              that leads to out-of-specification product output associated with a startup.
              This research investigation will take place in partnership with a leading
              textile manufacturer. The simulation model will be designed and validated in
              the context of the finishing operations for textile manufacturing. Experiments
              involving new policies to reduce the scrap for the startup phase will be
              conducted using the simulation model.
     If successful, the results of this
              research will lead to the establishment of new operational methods for the
              startup phase.  In practical terms, one expected outcome of this research is a
              reduction in the amount of waste carpet associated with the startup. This
              research also has general implications for other continuous manufacturing
              systems -- such as food and beverage, chemicals and paint, and pharmaceuticals
              -- as the number of startups continues to increase with the shift to
              make-to-order production to meet customer demands. Out of this broader,
              long-range concern, we plan to identify related projects and continue the
              industry involvement fostered by this partnership.
