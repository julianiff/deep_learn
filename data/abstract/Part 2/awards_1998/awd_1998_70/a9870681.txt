Abstract    :
              9870681  Fertig    The PI plans to investigate how orderly spatially modulated 
              structures in two dimensions interact with a pinning  potential. Pinning
              potentials include impurities and  artificial materials patterns and
              structures. A major  fraction of the proposed work is concerned with the
              electron  gas in two dimensions.  The study focuses on three areas:  the
              response of spin textures in quantum Hall systems to an  array of artificial
              structures, the response of pinned  Wigner crystals to low frequency
              electromagnetic fields, and  the role of plastic deformation on pinning
              processes in  vortex lattices that occur in superconductors.  %%%  This
              research is at the forefront of condensed matter theory  and is concerned with
              how electrons confined to a plane and  composite particles made up of electrons
              that participate in  a spatially ordered state, respond to defects such as 
              impurities and artificial structures. These problems  represent new challenges
              to theoretical descriptions of  layered materials and electronic phenomena that
              occur in  materials and at interfaces of materials. The PI's work will 
              contribute to developing new methods to understand  electronic phenomena that
              occur in materials and that are  potentially important in developing new device
              technologies.  ***
