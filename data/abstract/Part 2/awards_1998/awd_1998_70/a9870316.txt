Abstract    :
              9870316  It is becoming increasingly common for mutually untrusting  software
              components to be parts of the same program; examples  include Java applets,
              ActiveX controls, Component Object Model  (COM) objects, and extensible
              operating systems. Methods and  tools are created that make it easier for
              programmers to write  software components that will function securely when
              linked with  potentially hostile components. This is done by combining 
              research results on several topics: information hiding and  language design,
              hierarchical modularity, dynamic linking,  and access control. One result of
              this work is a set of tools  that let programmers precisely control the
              visibility and  accessibility of pieces of their software, allowing different 
              views of a software component to be presented to different  software clients
              depending on the provenance of the client code.  Software tools are implemented
              and distributed to support this  for programs written in the Java and ML
              languages.***
