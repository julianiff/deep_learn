This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
              project between Dr. Emilia P. Martins, University of Oregon, Eugene and Drs.
              Monique Halloy, University of Tucuman, Argentina and Antonieta Labra,
              Universidad de Chile, on a study of the evolutionary processes underlying
              convergence, one of the more remarkable examples of evolution by natural
              selection.  In this evolutionary phenomenon, distantly related taxa become
              similar to one another as they adapt to similar environments.  The study will
              involve fieldwork in Argentina and Chile to collect videotapes and tissue
              samples.  Molecular lab work and computer analyses will be conducted at the
              University of Oregon.
The researchers will apply recently developed
              statistical phylogenetic methods to test for evolutionary convergence two
              groups of lizards which are only distantly related, but which share a number of
              morphological and behavioral features.  By overlaying the communicative
              displays on a phylogeny, and inferring the actual patterns and processes
              leading to diversification of the similar pathways in the two groups of
              lizards, they will determine whether evolution has followed similar pathways in
              both groups, or whether it has simply landed on similar final solutions.  They
              will also apply modern phylogenetic comparative methods to the question of
              convergence, developing a statistical approach to determining whether two
              groups of taxa have been undergoing similar sorts of selective pressures.  This
              project is a first step in a potential long-term collaboration across three
              countries, the US, Chile and Argentina.
