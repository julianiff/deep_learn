POWRE: 
              Wavelet-Based Shape Features for Mammographic

The proposed project is a
              pilot effort to investigate the effects of wavelet-based compression on
              automated pattern recognition (APR) techniques. The investigation is a
              long-term project, and the work as outlined in this proposal is an initial
              phase of the research. The results of the research will be applied to the 
              problem of automated recognition of malignant versus benign masses in
              mammograms.  The long-term goal of the PI is to analyze  the effects of
              wavelet-based compression on the APR techniques, specifically the use of shape
              features for classifying mammographic masses. To research this goal, the PI
              will analytically and empirically assess the scalar-dependence of traditional
              shape features. The PI will develop distortion measures for compressed images
              where the distortion is with respect to feature extraction. Finally, she will
              utilize these measures with the scalar-dependence information to optimize
              specific compression schemes with regards to compression/APR tradeoffs.
