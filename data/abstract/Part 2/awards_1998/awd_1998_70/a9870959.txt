Acquisition of an Automated
              DNA Sequencer for Advanced Biomolecular Research
DNA sequence analysis has
              become an essential tool in many areas of biological research.  This award
              funds the purchase of a Perkin-Elmer ABI 377 DNA sequencer to be used by
              researchers in biology at the University of Hawaii.  The sequencer will be
              placed in the Biotechnology/Molecular Biology Instrumentation and Training
              facility.  The projects to be supported by this instrument include (1) exotic
              pest identification using genetic methods based on the polymerase chain
              reaction, (2) identification of symbiosis-induced bacterial genes in Vibrio
              fischeri, (3) molecular systematics of Hawaiian flora, (4) plant transformation
              technology for reduced variation of transgene expression, and (5) site directed
              mutagenesis and protein expression system to produce novel human serum albumin
              species.  These projects, and others making use of the new DNA sequencer, will
              enhance not only the research infrastructure at the University of Hawaii, but
              also training efforts through the Pacific Biomedical Research Center and the
              Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program.
