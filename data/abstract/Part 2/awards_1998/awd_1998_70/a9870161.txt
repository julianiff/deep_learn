In
              collaboration with S. Sethi, the PI will analyze the supersymmetric
matrix
              model quantum mechanics which has been conjectured to provide a
definition of
              M theory.  Crucial to the conjecture is the existence of
normalizable ground
              states in quantum mechanical gauge theories with
16 supersymmetries.  These
              ground states correspond to gravitons in
the model.  We seek to show existence
              and uniqueness of a groundstate
wavefunction, by computing an L2 index for a
              large family of
associated non Fredholm, (generalized) Dirac operators.  We
              will
analyze the structure of the wavefunction in order to determine,
              for
example, the "size" of the graviton.  In further work related to
              the
matrix model, in collaboration with S. Paban and Savdeep Sethi, the
              PI
will study constraints on the effective action in Yang Mills theories
with
              16 supersymmetries.  Mathematically, this may be viewed as a
moduli problem
              for deformations of systems with 16 supersymmetries.
In collaboration with W.
              Pardon, the PI proposes to establish a
harmonic theory for the L2 cohomology
              of singular projective varieties
with the metric induced by a projective
              embedding, extending their
harmonic theory for varieties with isolated
              singularities.  The goal
of such an investigation is to bring to the study of
              the L2 cohomology
(and conjecturally the intersection cohomology) of these
              varieties the
same array of tools available for studying complete Kahler
              manifolds.
This includes Hodge and Lefschetz decompositions and
              potentially
Bochner type vanishing theorems.

The primary goal of this
              project is to explore a recently proposed
model for a theory of quantum
              gravity known as the matrix model.
Mathematically this model has many
              advantages, but it is not yet
complete and is not yet clear that it gives a
              physically reasonable
theory.  We will perform various (mathematical) tests to
              determine if
the model does have the conjectured desired physical properties. 
              For
example, we seek to determine whether it predicts the existence of
              a
stable particle, "the graviton".  Then we will try to determine
              the
structure of this particle and see if the model gives a framework
              for
computing predicted outcomes to simple processes such as scattering
              of
gravitons.
