Abstract    :
              Abstract  9870839  Graber        This research is aimed at determining how
              various receptors  activate specific G proteins. G proteins are  coupled to a 
              number of hormone and neurotransmitter receptors, and they  consist of 3
              subunits: alpha, beta and gamma. The subunit  determines the type of reaction
              that will occur.  The  research here is attempting to identify the residues and
               regions on the alpha subunits that interact with the 5HT1  and muscarinc
              receptors.  Amino acids in a region which is  required for coupling to the 5-HT
              receptors will be mutated  and  then functional assays of the receptor binding
              will be  performed. Truncation of the alpha 1 subunit will also be  examined to
              determine the minimal residues involved in the  coupling. Similar studies will
              be done with the muscarinc  receptors and the  alpha q subunits.  Other
              experiments will  be done to see if physical interactions occur in the absence 
              of function. These studies will aid in our understanding of  how many different
              receptors interact with G proteins to  result in different biological
              activities.    Heterotrimeric G proteins interact with a number of  different
              hormone and neurotransmitter receptors to bring  about different biological
              activities.  This research is  aimed at determining how one of the major
              subunits of the G  proteins interacts with the receptors to determine the 
              specificity of the reaction. Since G proteins are important  for many
              biological functions, these studies will be  important for understanding of the
              basic mechanisms involved  in determining which reactions will occur.
