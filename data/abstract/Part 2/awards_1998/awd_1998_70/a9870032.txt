An improved, double-pendulum suspension system for the
              test of masses in gravitational wave detectors will be designed and a prototype
              will be built.  It will provide a feasible way of suspending and controlling
              the test masses in the LIGO detector environment.  Different sensors of the
              pendulum modes and actuators on the pendulum masses will be designed and tested
              on the prototype.  

Several interferometric gravitational wave detectors are
              now in construction around the world.  They use various different ways of
              suspending the test masses so that they can be isolated from seismic noise and
              treated as free masses for the gravitational field in the widest possible
              frequency range.  A choice of a suspension design represents a delicate balance
              between seismic isolation, thermal noise, reliability and control design.  The
              initial design for the LIGO detectors is the simplest pendulum design.  The
              effort at Penn State, integrated with the work of other groups in the LIGO
              Science Collaboration, will provide a design and a prototype of a better
              suspension system that will increase the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors at
              low frequencies by reducing the seismic and thermal noise contributions.
