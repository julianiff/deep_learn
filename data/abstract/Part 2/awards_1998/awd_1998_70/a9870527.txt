Abstract    :
              Development of smart materials and structures is a rapidly emerging field in
              engineering.  A structure is considered "smart" when, together with a
              controller, it can sense changes in its environment and adapt to those changes.
               However, a major barrier in the design of smart structures is that current
              actuation devices such as strain-induced actuators are limited in their output
              displacement capability.  As a result, they are often equipped with compliant
              stroke amplifiers.  To eliminate the reliance on intuitive and ad-hoc design
              methods for these actuators, a new systematic design method is needed.  The
              goal of this research is to develop such a method.  This new method will employ
              a topology optimization approach, accounting for issues particular to smart
              structures such as maximum amplification, maximum mechanical efficiency,
              impedance matching, and least weight.  The resulting optimal compliant
              mechanism designs will then be integrated with smart materials to form an
              actuator.  It is expected that these optimally designed actuators will offer
              improved stroke performance over current smart actuator designs.  The funding
              provided by the POWRE program will allow the PI to conduct this fundamental
              research and establish her own research program and laboratory in the area of
              smart structures design.
