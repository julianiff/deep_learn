Abstract    :
              Multi-disciplinary Program on Inequality and Social Policy

Funding is sought
              for a multidisciplinary program which will train a new generation of scholars
              in the study of social and economic inequality and the public policies which
              may influence it. Inequality -now at its highest level since the end of World
              War II --is perhaps one of the most important problems facing the United States
              today, yet no university offers an organized program of study which provides
              the interdisciplinary training needed to address its complexities. The proposed
              program focuses on six constituent features of inequality: work, wages and the
              marketplace; neighborhoods and spatial segregation; family structure and
              parental roles; immigration, race and labor market segregation; educational
              access; and social and economic policy.

Students admitted into Ph.D.
              programs in economics, political science, public policy, or sociology would be
              eligible. Those accepted would participate in the following core activities in
              addition to meeting the requirements of their home doctoral programs: (1) Three
              semester Interdisciplinary Proseminar in Inequality and Social Policy, (2)
              Field Specialization, (3) Qualifying Paper on Inequality, (4) Research
              Apprenticeship, (5) Summer Research Fellowships, (6) Advanced Research Seminar
              on Inequality, (7) Summer Institute on Inequality, (8) Galbraith Scholars
              program for undergraduates, and (9) National Fellows program.
