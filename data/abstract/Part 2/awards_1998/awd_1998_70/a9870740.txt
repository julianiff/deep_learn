Abstract    :
              EIA-9870740  Levy, Henry M.  Karlin, Anna R.  University of Washington    ESS:
              Distributed Resource Management in Local-Area and   Wide-Area Networks   
              Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing the  
              communication and computational power of networked computers. However,  
              current software systems are unable to utilize the capabilities of modern  
              hardware components, because they are designed for last-generation   hardware.
              The goal of this research is to enable more effective use of   future networks
              and processors through design and implementation of new   software structures
              and algorithms better suited to the characteristics of   future hardware.   
              The research focuses on two related but independent domains. First, in  
              local-area networks (clusters), this work seeks to improve the performance   of
              applications through distributed, cluster-wide resource management. It   will
              develop algorithms that permit the tight-knit sharing of all   cluster-wide
              network resources: processors, network, memory, and disk   storage. Second,
              this research seeks to apply experience in global resource   management to a
              much broader domain -- the global Internet. The project   will develop and test
              algorithms that optimally and dynamically locate both   data and computation in
              the Internet, in order to improve data-access   latencies and reduce network
              bandwidth utilization. A significant component   of this research is the
              construction of a software simulation   infrastructure to test hypotheses
              applied to such a large-scale system as   the world-wide web.
