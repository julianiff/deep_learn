Abstract    :
              9870426  Hudspeth  This POWRE study is designed to develop a nuclear based
              molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Peronomycetes (Oomycota; Oomycetes).
              The phylogenetic interrelationships of these diverse fungal-like members of the
              kingdom Straminipila, despite the major economic impact of several
              phytopathogenic members on crop production, is poorly understood. The primary
              goal is to derive a common database to infer the evolutionary relationship of
              major genera both within and between established orders. The database is to
              consist of nucleotide sequences derived from the gapC locus which encodes the
              essential glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. gapC loci
              will be amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products will be
              determined either by direct sequencing or by sequencing of cloned products.
              Taxa to be evaluated include phytopathogenic genera. The inferred phylogenies
              are to be used in comparison with other molecular and morphologically derived
              phylogenies both to minimize biases introduced into individual molecular data
              sets by differential evolutionary rates, and to more accurately reflect the
              true history of these economically important organisms.
