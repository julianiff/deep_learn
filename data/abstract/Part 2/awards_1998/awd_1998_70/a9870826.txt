Abstract    :
              Appling
The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the
              organization and compartmentation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in
              eukaryotes. Metabolic compartmentation is found universally in eukaryotes, from
              the highest mammals to the lowest unicellular forms, and is a critical aspect
              of normal cell function. The organization, compartmentation, and control of
              folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is poorly understood. Previous work
              supported by this grant demonstrated the usefulness of the yeast Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae as a model system. I propose to continue our use of biochemical,
              molecular genetic, and 13C NMR techniques to further dissect the flow of
              one-carbon units between the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and endoplasmic
              reticulum. We will use purine biosynthesis, mitochondrial protein synthesis,
              and methyl group biogenesis, respectively, as indicators of one-carbon
              metabolism in each compartment. Four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) Isolate
              and characterize mutants in the yeast genes encoding AICAR transformylase/IMP
              cyclohydrolase and 5,10-methylene-THF reductase. (2) Investigate the roles of
              MIS1, DFR1, and ORF YBL03-11 gene products in mitochondrial one-carbon
              metabolism (3) Investigate the noncatalytic function of the ADE3 gene product,
              C1-THF synthase, in purine biosynthesis. (4) Determine how one-carbon units are
              distributed into the three major pools (CHO-THF, CH2-THF, CH3-THF) in response
              to varying growth and nutritional conditions. The experimental design involves
              (a) construction of yeast mutants blocked in specific one-carbon reactions; (b)
              biochemical assays of formylmethionyl-tRNA levels in mitochondria from
              wild-type and mutant strains (c) synthetic-lethal and two-hybrid screens for
              additional components of these pathways; and (d) NMR analysis of wild-type and
              mutant strains labeled in vivo with 13C-enriched substrates to directly follow
              the intercompartmental flow of one-carbon units.
