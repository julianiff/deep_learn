POWRE/CISE:  Integration of
              Non-Conventional CMOS Structures into Fully-Automated Synthesis Tools

This
              research is aimed at expanding the PI's research into a new area and
              establishing a program in design automation and computer architecture at Brown
              University.  The PI will utilize this work as a means of developing a role
              model for women computer engineers and getting them involved in this exciting
              project.  The goal is to perform exploratory work in the area of "mixed logic
              structure" synthesis for embedded system design.  By using a mixed logic
              approach., the designer can automatically synthesize designs that combine both
              conventional and non-conventional CMOS structures within the same circuit in
              order to best exploit the advantages of each structure in terms of area, delay,
              power, consumption, and signal integrity.  What makes this work unique is that
              the optimization techniques developed will not target one specific logic style,
              but rather will be able to pick and choose among several.
