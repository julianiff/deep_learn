	This funding will support work to develop a novel particle
              detector using super-fluid Helium.  If the work is successful, this detector
              will be used to look for very low energy neutrinos such as those which are
              produced in nuclear interactions in the Sun.  For many years, experiments to
              study solar neutrinos have seen fewer neutrinos than predicted.  One
              explanation, supported by recent experimental results, suggests that the
              neutrinos may be changing their type on the journey from the Sun to the Earth. 
              The experiments which could be done with this detector will help to determine
              if this explanation is correct.
