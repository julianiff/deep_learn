This research involves new and improved methods for robust
              estimation of multivariate location and shape and identification of outliers. 
              Massive data sets, especially in high dimension, form a particular target of
              the research.  The research focuses on theoretical, methodological, and
              computational questions in robust multivariate analysis, and also extends the
              investigators previous work into cluster analysis.

Identification of
              outliers and clusters of data in high dimension and in massive data sets is an
              important and difficult problem.  These data sets occur in satellite imagery,
              in the human genome project, in x-ray astronomy, in geophysics, and in many
              other areas of science.  They range in size from multiple gigabytes to
              terabytes, and present significant challenges for analysis.  This project is
              aimed at methods for uncovering previously unknown structure in these data
              sets.  The computationally intensive nature of the methods relates this
              research directly to the High Performance Computing and Communication Federal
              Strategic Area, and the applications to environmental science data relates it
              to the Environment and Global Change area.  The project is supported by and
              associated with the National Partnership for Advanced Computational
              Infrastructure.
