Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will be concerned with  the study of the
              symmetries and the dynamics of string  theory, quantum field theories and
              `integrable` quantum spin  chains.  The understanding of the symmetries of
              physical  models gives us detailed information about how particles  interact
              with one another. String theory is the only known  consistent candidate for a
              unifying model of all the  fundamental interactions (forces) of nature
              including  gravity.  A better understanding of the symmetry  relationships
              between string theory and the quantum field  theories underlying the
              fundamental forces will lead to new  methods for computing quantities of
              physical interest, such  as the masses of the elementary particles.  For
              integrable  quantum field theories and spin chains, such quantities can  be
              computed exactly.  This work is of paramount importance  in quantifying our
              understanding of the elementary particles  and the forces of nature.
