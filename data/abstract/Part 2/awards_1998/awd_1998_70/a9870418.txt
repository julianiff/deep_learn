POWRE/CISE: Wireless
              Transport of Low-Bitrate Multiresolution Video

This research is the basis
              for developing a strong research and education program in the area of wireless
              transmission.  The emphasis is on the innovative research in designing and
              evaluating new coding techniques particularly suited for the low-bitrate
              wireless arena.  The project will provide laboratory facilities specifically to
              enable the researchers to perform real-time analysis of coded video
              transmission and analyze the tradeoffs between developed coding schemes.  The
              coding schemes will be developed within a multiresolution framework and
              combined source-channel coding analysis.  The results of this effort will be
              adaptive source and channel coding schemes optimized for low-bitrate digital
              video transmission in selected mobile environments.
