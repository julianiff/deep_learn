Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Todd Disotell and his
              collaborators at New York University will purchase an ABI PRISM 377 system
              which consists of an electrophoresis and detection unit, a Power Macintosh
              computer and software for DNA sequencing analysis or PCR fragment sizing and
              quantification. The system will allow high throughput through the use of
              multicolored fluorescence technology, allowing multiplex electrophoreses by
              co-loading the products of multiple PCR or sequencing reactions in the same
              lane. To increase the efficiency of the group of utilizing scientists, a
              thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Geneamp PCR System 9700) along with a
              microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5400 Series) and microconcentrator (Savant DNA
              SpeedVac) will be acquired and housed with the ABI genetic analyzer. A Power
              Macintosh computer will allow data collected on the ABI genetic analyzer to be
              analyzed off-line, allowing the computer controlling the ABI machine to be
              dedicated to data collection.   This instrumentation will greatly improve the
              efficiency of six research projects, pursued by a number of investigators.
              These include the study of 1. the genetic and developmental mechanisms of
              morphogenesis and the evolution of form in rhabditid nematodes; 2.  genetics of
              organogenesis in the gonad of C. elegans; 3.primate molecular evolution and
              population genetics; 4. evolutionary genetics of cave adaptations in fish;
              unidentified proteins in fission yeast that interact with Ras G-proteins and
              microtubules; and 6. recognition of DNA structure by HMG proteins. The machine
              will also be used at both graduate and undergraduate levels and thus serve a
              valuable educational as well as research function.
