Abstract    :
              9870954  Shiller  This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Southern Mississippi provides a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass
              spectrometer for study of environmental analysis.  It will be particularly used
              in the analysis of chemical species at extremely low concentrations, and
              research is expected to focus on study of metal transport and cycling in river
              and oceanic systems, biotic metal uptake and toxicity, sediment contamination,
              geochemical study of weathering and subduction zone processes, and sediment
              diagenesis.  The facility will be managed by USM on the Stennis Space Center
              campus, with collaboration in research from investigators at a variety of other
              regional universities.  The project is supported jointly by the Division of
              Ocean Sciences and Division of Earth Sciences at NSF, with supplementary
              support from the EPSCoR program.  University of Southern Mississippi will
              provide cost-share support for 30% of total project costs.  ***
