Abstract    :
              This project tests whether leaders of democratic polities confront uniquely
              strong constraints on their ability to use force abroad.  In particular, the
              investigator will examine whether the existence of elections and opposition
              parties influences the use of military power abroad.  To do so, she will use
              both game-theoretic and econometric methods of analysis.  The importance of the
              project inheres in its potential to clarify the relationship between polities
              and peace.  A large and growing literature argues that a democratic peace
              prevails-that is, that the incidence of wars and other militarized disputes is
              much lower between democracies than between members of other country pairs. 
              One argument advanced to explain the democratic peace is that domestic
              constraints on leaders (including periodic elections and competitive parties)
              are stronger in democracies than in nondemocracies.  Investigating this
              hypothesis using U.S. data, however, the investigator did not find evidence
              that was completely consistent with it.  To extend this analysis to other
              countries, the investigator needs to be able to use game-theoretic and
              econometric methods of analyses more fluently.  This award will enable her to
              retool so that she can extend her research to the next level of analysis and
              maintain her leadership role in the field of international relations.
