Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT        Proposal Number:  CTS-9870365    Principal Investigator:  C.
              Lasko      A POWRE award.  The research will focus on the potential use of
              chitosan, a biopolymer known to bind metal ions in solution, to remove the
              chromium (IV) from industrial waste water.  Two methods will be used to
              determine the optimal conditions for binding, a stirred-batch method and a
              column method.  Once the optimal conditions have been established, the method
              will be tested using waste water from a local industrial electroplating
              operation.  A second objective of the study is to introduce undergraduate
              students to the scientific approach used in research.  This specific research
              appeals to most environmental problems.  This POWRE award is critical for the
              PI to maintain a research program and further her professional growth in a
              predominantly undergraduate institution.
