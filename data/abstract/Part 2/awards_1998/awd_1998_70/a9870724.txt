              Software Systems: Geographic Information Systems on High-Speed Clusters: A
              Vertically Integrated Approach    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are
              important management and analysis tools in science, and government.  Practical
              interest in GIS has spurred fundamental research in several areas of computer
              science.  However, this research has focused mainly on abstract problems, and
              technology transfer to GIS practitioners has been slow.    This project seeks
              to develop an improved foundation for dealing with massive spatial data through
              a collaboration of researchers in computer algorithms, software systems, and
              environmental sciences.  The research deals with GIS problems at all levels of
              abstraction-from applications to algorithms, systems, and tools.  The
              algorithmic research builds on recent advances in geometric algorithms and
              I/O-efficient algorithms for problems that arise in GIS.  The systems research
              seeks to develop and evaluate system support for I/O-intensive applications on
              networked clusters, incorporating experimental research in storage systems,
              memory management, and networking.  The common focal point for all project
              members is a toolkit that supports practical implementations of GIS algorithms
              and applications.    The expected outputs of the research are: (1) new
              algorithms for dealing with massive spatial data sets, (2) whole-system
              implementations of GIS algorithms on high-speed clusters, and (3) transfer of
              these computational advances into the practice of GIS in the environmental
              sciences.
