Abstract    :
              Direct, time dependent solutions to the Schroedinger equation are performed
              using lattice techniques and parallel computation.  Problems to be studied
              include correlated two electron processes in atoms, heavy-particle collisions
              with atoms and two electron wavepackets in external fields.
