              (University of Central Florida)     Title: Multiphoton Effects in
              Polydiacetylenes at Ultra High Optical Intensities      Abstract    The
              proposal is to investigate the non-linear effects in Polydiacetylenes at high
              optical intensities in the transparency region around 1600 nm which coincides
              with the communication window where ultrafast nonlinear optical applications
              are interesting.  The program will have impact on conjugate polymers,
              fundamental physics in highly nonlinear materials at high intensities, and
              potential applications of polymers to all-optical signal processing and
              switching in communication systems.
