Abstract    :
              9870597  Belitz  This is a theoretical research grant with the objective to 
              enhance current understanding of many-electron systems at  very low
              temperatures, and especially of phase transitions  and other collective
              phenomena in these systems.  A  particular objective of the research is to
              further develop  and apply an effective field theory that allows a systematic 
              treatment of electronic systems in the presence of  impurities.  The methods
              employed include general field  theoretic techniques, the renormalization
              group, and many-  body perturbation theory.  Specific systems for which this 
              work is relevant include magnets with impurities,  superconductors, and doped
              semiconductors.  %%%   This is a theoretical research grant with the objective
