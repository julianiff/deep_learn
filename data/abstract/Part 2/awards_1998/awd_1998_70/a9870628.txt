Abstract    :
              What explains the development possibilities of rural people in poor countries? 
              Existing theories tend to overemphasize the importance of the colonial past and
              continuing international inequalities in contemporary rural decision making.
              This project by an anthropologist from American University uses a case study
              approach to investigate the local variation of individual economic strategies
              in a rural area of Mali.  The focus will be on how people get the social and
              technical knowledge needed to work, in particular how they use social networks
              to access resources and markets. The relationship between group characteristics
              (gender, ethnicity, age, religion, education) and individual experiences will
              be examined.  The patterns of allocation between consumption and investment
              will be analyzed.  Data will be collected by the researcher and her Malian
              anthropological colleagues to update a sample of 60 households first studied in
              1978.  Repeat visits to rural households will collect data on economic
              activities over time, intra-household transfers of resources and production,
              livestock transfers, expenses and investment.  The new knowledge to be created
              will advance our understanding of how local action can be pro-active as well as
              reactive in economic development, and the extent to which individual as well as
              group action can be effective in creating social change.  In addition the
              knowledge will be valuable for policy makers designing strategies to improve
              living standards for people in this savanna West African region.
