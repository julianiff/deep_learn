Abstract    :
              STOERMER  DEB-9870218    A Mongolian-American International Partnership is
              proposed to survey a group of algae from poorly known Lake Hovsgol in Mongolia.
               Lake Hovsgol is a second, less-famous, ancient, large lake located in NW
              Mongolia and within the rift zone that also contains Russia's Lake Baikal.  The
              partnership of scientists from the University of Michigan and the Mongolian
              State University will complete a floristic survey of the diatom algae within
              Mongolia's Lake Hovsgol National Park with simultaneous collection of
              environmental data.  This group of algae are important as indicators of
              environmental change and as tools of paleoecological reconstruction.  Ancient
              lake systems also contain organisms of great interest to science, because the
              species are indigenous to these lakes.  The partnership will result in the
              documentation of between 600-1000 species, many that are new to science and
              probably endemic to Lake Hovsgol.  Additional results of the partnership will
              include the training of Mongolian students in the study of diatoms, the
              creation of the first permanent diatom herbarium and reference collection in
              Mongolia, and the publication of a diatom flora in book and electronic format. 
              Integration of collections and collection data with a proposed GIS and
              established herbaria in the United States and Europe will insure accessibility
              of findings to a large international audience.
