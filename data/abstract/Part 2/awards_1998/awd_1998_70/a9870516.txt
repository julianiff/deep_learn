Abstract    :
              9870516  May  This research will analyze the importance of molecular
              rearrangements in generating new alleles at the N locus, a complex viral
              resistance locus in the Solanaceae. Analysis of the evolutionary importance of
              rearrangements will address the question of how the genomic architecture of
              plants might be organized to provide continued resistance to microbial
              pathogens. In these analyses, the investigator will take advantage of a strong
              functional selection for altered resistance alleles to recover rearrangements
              at N in Solanaceae species. Comparing these results to the structure of the N
              locus in related species within the Solanaceae will allow assessment of the
              evolutionary importance of rearrangements in generating new N genes and
              alleles. Understanding the molecular evolutionary interactions of host plants
              and their associated microorganisms is essential to developing sustainable
              agricultural systems with low ecological impact and can define novel approaches
              to plant protection.
