Abstract    :
              Research in Low Energy Nuclear Physics A broadly based program is proposed to
              study properties of nuclei and atoms using the Stony Brook superconducting
              linac as well as state of the art facilities available elsewhere such as
              Gammasphere.  The program emphasizes frontier issues in nuclear structure
              physics (smooth band termination, physics near the proton drip line near
              A=3D100, M1 excitations, superdeformed and other large deformation shapes in
              the A=3D80 region, and the competition between particle and gamma-ray emission
              at the limits of stability).  Another venue of research utilizes the decay of
              giant resonances to study properties of nuclear matter (nuclear dissipation,
              superconducting-to-liquid drop phase transition, nu-clear compressibility as a
              function of temperature). Another component of the program proposes to continue
              preparations for a test of the electroweak interaction (parity non-conservation
              in Fr atoms).  A more suitable Francium laboratory will be prepared in order to
              perform atomic physics measurements with great accuracy (Stark-induced 7s  -->
              8s transition and hyperfine anomaly measurements).  The Stony Brook Nuclear
              Structure Laboratory also serves as a focus of many educational activities.
              Students at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels
              participate in the research program with various intensities, from beam line
              construction to running actual experiments.
