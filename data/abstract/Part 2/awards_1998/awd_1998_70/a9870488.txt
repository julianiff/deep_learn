Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS-9870488    Principal Investigator:  A.
              Robertson      A POWRE Award.  The work will study the use of Chimera grids in
              the numerical computation of viscous flows in which the boundaries move and
              deform with time.  The method will be applied to the study of flow in an
              arterial bifurcation which includes a cerebral aneurysm and in the study of
              viscoelastic fluids.  This POWRE award will make it possible for the PI to
              redirect her research by developing expertise which can be applied to flows of
              viscoelastic fluids and in the initiatation and development of aneurysms.
