Abstract    :
              9870550  Kedem  Integrable quantum field theories are related to certain
              integrable lattice models on the infinite lattice through the notion of the
              space of states, which carries the structure of an affine algebra
              representation.  The PI will use the structure of representations of certain
              affine algebra's to define massive integrable field theories in terms of these
              representations.    Previous results of the PI and co-authors suggest the
              existence of a certain fermionic construction of the coset representations of
              the Virasoro algebra corresponding to minimal models in conformal field theory
              and its deformations.  This construction will reflect the role of the
              representation as the space of states of a particular massive deformation of a
              conformal field theory.  The PI plans to apply results about the space of
              states of integrable lattice models to supply such a construction.  This will
              give a representation theoretical proof of the fermionic character formulas. 
              Kedem will use these results to find the representations corresponding to
              massive integrable models and its relation to non-critical RSOS models, and the
              role of deformed Virasoro algebra in such theories.    In addition the PI will
              apply representation theoretical methods to find solutions to certain
              longstanding problems in the theory of lattice integrable models, associated
              with the chiral Potts model.
