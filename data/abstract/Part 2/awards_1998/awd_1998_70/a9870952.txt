Abstract    :
              9870952  Bryers  The objective of this research is to determine the potential 
              to block bacterial colonization of a biomaterial by  biologically interfering
              with the bacterial adhesion  process.  In a radical approach, the investigator
              proposes  to deliver from the biomaterial itself, plasmid genes that  upon
              incorporation into both arriving macrophage and  fibroblast cells, will express
              a heterologous polypeptide  that blocks bacterial biofilm formation.  The
              research plan  has three major goals:  (1) the construction of plasmids 
              containing the gene for a antibacterial adhesion peptide,  (2) the
              quanification of plasmid gene transfer in cells via  in vitro culture, and (3)
              the measurement of gene products  and their ability to inhibit bacterial film
              formation.  The  deterrence of biofilm formation on materials has important 
              uses in a variety of applications.  These include food  processing and handling
              equipment, heat exchange devices for  use in power and food industries, and
              biomedical instruments  and devices.  ***
