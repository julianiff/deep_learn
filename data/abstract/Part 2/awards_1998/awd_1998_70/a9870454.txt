This project is
              the start of research effort for the PI who is currently an Adjunct Assistant
              Professor. The objective of the project is to refine and generalize an existing
              computational model for diagnostics.  The model uses the classification on how
              cues are altered when defects interact and a metric called evidence points for
              rating possible solutions. The model applies the metric to compare as many
              alternative solutions as are necessary for each case.  The value of the metric
              is based on the evidence in the case, so the justification for the ranking of
              each alternative solution is available.  This information is useful when
              developing the knowledge-base and also provides valuable information to anyone
              using it for decision support.
