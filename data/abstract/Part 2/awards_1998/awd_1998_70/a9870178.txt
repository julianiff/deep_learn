Abstract    :
              9870178  Lai    This project concerns investigation of multivariate spline
              functions.  Bivariate and trivariate splines of smoothness r and degree d, will
              be studied more carefully to enhance their computational efficiency which is
              essential for applications in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) and
              numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE).     The PI will
              identify the best spline spaces for these applications in the   bivariate
              setting, comparing the dimension of all spline spaces of a fixed   smoothness,
              the number of triangles of  their underlying triangulations and   their
              approximation power.  The PI will implement these best spline spaces   when r=1
              and r=2 for typical applications in CAGD and numerical solution   of PDE's,
              e.g., scattered data fitting, filling polygonal holes,  numerical   solutions
              of linear and nonlinear biharmonic equations. The PI will study   the
              construction of compactly supported orthonormal wavelets under H1 norm    using
              bivariate splines so that the numerical solution of the standard   elliptic
              equations can be solved without inverting the linear systems.   Furthermore,
              the PI will also study the trivariate spline spaces and identify   the best one
              for the application in numerical solutions of 3D  partial differential
              equations, in particular 3D Navier-Stokes equations.  Once the best spline
              space for r=1 is identified, the PI will implement  it for numerical solution
              of PDE's in the trivariate setting.   When computing with these splines,
              multi-level and domain decomposition   methods will be employed to improve the
              performance of the computation.
