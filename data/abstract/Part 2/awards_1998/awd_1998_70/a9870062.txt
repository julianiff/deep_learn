In this project, Alexeev will continue investigating the
              canonical functorial compactification of the moduli space of principally
              polarized varieties, and similar moduli spaces of toric and semiabelian pairs.
              

This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is
              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated
              figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
              polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, 
              but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
              fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
