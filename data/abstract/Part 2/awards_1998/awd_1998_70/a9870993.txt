Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT        Proposal Number:      CTS-9870993    Principal Investigator:    
               W. Lempert, M. Samimy      Funds are awarded to develop a high speed
              diagnostic imaging system which will provide the capability to study the
              dynamic behavior of time evolving and three dimensional flow fields.  The
              instrumentation will consist of a high power solid state "burst mode" laser and
              a companion digital CCD framing camera.  The laser system will be tunable in
              the mid-infrared, visible, and ultraviolet region of the spectrum and will be
              capable of generating pulses with a minimum interpulse period of 1 microsecond.
               The system will be used to study the influence of streamwise vorticity on
              acoustic noise suppression, physics of large scale mixing in complex, three
              dimensional flows, anomalous shock wave propagation and dispersion in weakly
              ionized plasma, and the creation and sustaining of atmospheric pressure
              volumetric plasmas.  The system will also be incorporated into a two quarter
              electromagnetics laboratory sequence, "Atoms, molecules, electromagnetics, and
              information."
