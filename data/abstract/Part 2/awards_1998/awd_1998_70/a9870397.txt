Abstract    :
              Dr. Huff will carry out a research project whose broad goal is to understand the
              genetic program controlling how cells are selected to become fat cells.  She
              will characterize a key regulatory gene necessary for fat-cell development. 
              These studies will be performed in Drosophila.  Characterization of this
              fat-cell regulatory gene will provide insights into key processes by which
              cells are committed to a particular cell fate and may lead to advances in
              understanding how a multicellular organism develops.

This work is supported
              by NSF's POWRE program that provides opportunities for women to reenter the
              scientific community.  Dr. Huff's research project will provide her with
              additional training in genetics and developmental biology.  Furthermore, the
              results of this project will lead to several different lines of investigation
              for future studies.
