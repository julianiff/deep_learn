Laser based photo acoustic methods provide the possibility
              to excite short wavelength surface acoustic waves (SAWs) with extremely high
              amplitudes.  Such waves present an efficient tool for the investigation of
              elastic and mechanical properties of solid materials.  Until recently suface
              acoustic waves remained among the few wave phenomena  for which strong
              nonlinear effects were not observed, since it was not possible to excite and
              detect them with traditional methds.  The manifestation of these nonlinear
              phenomena depends on the nonlinear constants of the solid which reflect the
              microscopic structure and quality of the material and the changes due to
              treatment, fatigue, and wear.  

The objective of the project is to develop a
              SAW spectrometer based on laser excitation and detection of broadband SAW
              pulses.  The method will be applied to characterize industrial and natural
              materials such as fused silica, crystalline silicon, metals, and
              polymers.

The project will contribute to a better understanding of the
              propagation of nonlinear SAWs in isotropic and anisotropic solid materials, to
              the development of efficient techniques for their generation and detection, as
              well as to diagnostic methods of surface and bulk elastic properties of solid
              materials.  The study of nonlinear surface acoustic waves will provide an
              impact on different fields such as materials science, acousto electronics,
              nonlinear acoustics, theory of nonlinear waves, and seismology.  Support of
              this project will enhance the education and training of students at Texas A&M
              University.
