Abstract    :
              This is a study of world income inequality.  It begins from the observations
              that average incomes in the richest nations are thirty times those in the
              poorest nations, and that intercountry income -- not inequality within nations
              --  is the major component of total world income inequality. Previous work in
              this research program focused on developing a common formula for the
              conventional inequality measures (the coefficient of variation, the Gini, the
              Theil index, and the variance of the logarithms) and then applying that formula
              to trends in intercountry inequality to determine the essential facts. Among
              the questions addressed were: how large is the inequality, whether it is
              increasing or decreasing, whether the trend is due to nations' differential
              economic growth or their differential population growth, what countries
              contribute most to intercountry inequality and to change in intercountry
              inequality, and whether results are robust over the conventional inequality
              measures. This new phase of the project will extend that line of research in
              new analytic directions, to include a social welfare component. Comparing
              trends in intercountry inequality based on different assumptions about the
              relative welfare impact of income transfers will determine the extent to which
              conclusions about trends in intercountry inequality depend on the relative
              weight given to the lower and upper ends of the income distribution.     This
              research will bring a new level of scientific rigor to sociological study of
              the important question of whether income is becoming more equally or less
              equally distributed across nations.
