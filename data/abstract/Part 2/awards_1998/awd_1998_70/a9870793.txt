Abstract    :
                    9870793  Espey  Mammalian ovaries have two important functions.  They
              release eggs during the fertile years and they secrete steroid hormones to
              prepare the body for reproduction.  these processes of ovulation and steroid
              secretion are carried out by ovarian follicles under the control of pituitary
              hormones known as gonadotropins.  The principal aim of the present project by
              Dr. Espey is to isolate and identify the ovarian genes that are activated by
              the gonadotropic hormones from the pituitary gland.  This analysis of ovarian
              gene expression will be carried out by a new procedure known as "differential
              display", which involves complex methods in molecular biology and recombinant
              DNA technologies.  The Project will use laboratory rats as the experimental
              animal, because this species is a common and inexpensive subject for ovulation
              research.  The information gained from this work should be useful in
              understanding ovulation and ovarian steroid secretion in all mammals, including
              humans, because it is generally believed that these procreative processes are
              similar in all species.  In summary, the project will increase the existing
              knowledge of gene expression and related biochemical events that occur in the
              ovary during ovulation.  The results will improve our understanding of how
              hormones work, and expand the science of regulating fertility and infertility.
