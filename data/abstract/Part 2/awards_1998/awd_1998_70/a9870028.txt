Abstract    :
                   Many engineered devices and biophysical systems become  unstable when
              subjected to certain changes in their  environments.  Such instabilities can
              result in a  substantial loss of efficiency, or in catastrophic failure.  These
              instabilities can sometimes be controlled by feedback  mechanisms that
              constantly monitor the system's behavior and  compare it to a mathematical
              model of the desired behavior.       The research proposed here addresses
              issues that arise  when faithful mathematical models are unavailable or when 
              some characteristic of the system makes it impossible to  implement more
              conventional control methods.  The research  will focus on the use of
              time-delay methods that substitute  the past behavior of the system itself for
              the computed  ideal reference state.       This research should be viewed as
              part of a long-term  scientific effort to understand the dynamics and control
              of  large systems, but short-term results relevant to areas of  current
              engineering interest are expected as well.  Two  examples of primary interest
              are semiconductor lasers, which  have instabilities that occur on extremely
              fast time scales,  and electrical activity in the heart, a complex system for 
              which sufficiently accurate mathematical modeling is  extremely difficult.
