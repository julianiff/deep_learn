The goal of this proposal is to study the dynamics of a variety
              of quantum systems ranging from a dense gas of very hot pions, to that of an
              extremely cold, Bose-Einstein condensed, atomic vapor. The common denominator
              of these systems is that they all obey the Bose-Einstein statistics and can be
              simulated numerically using very efficient, newly developed algorithms by this
              investigator. The importance of these studies is that they can tell us how
              matter behaves under very extreme circumstances.  In the case of pions, which
              are created in ultra high energy collisions of large nuclei, such as gold or
              uranium, their collective excitations reveal ways in which a basic symmetry of
              nature is restored at high tempearature. Such a high temperature occurs nowhere
              else naturally except during the early Big-Bang formation of the universe. In
              Bose-Einstein condensations, a single quantum state is occupied by a
              macroscopic number of particles. Thus the very fine details of a quantum state
              can be magnified a million-billion-billion times. The exploitation of this
              occupation can in principle be used to make exceedingly high precision
              measurments.
