Abstract    :
              9870544  Sun  This award funded through the Professional Opportunities for Women
              in Research and Education (POWRE) program supports  Professor Sun's statistics
              research and visiting professorship in the fall  semester (1999) at the
              University of California at Berkeley. The proposed research includes studies of
              bumps, mixtures, clustering and discrimination, and some biased sampling models
              in statistics, as well as their link and applications to Astronomy and other
              sciences. The visiting professorship at Berkeley will enable Professor Sun to
              broaden her research horizon and interact with world class leaders in
              statistics. It provides an ideal opportunity in her middle career to achieve
              some crucial professional growth and enhance her research and leadership
              potential.  This POWRE project is supported by the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
