Abstract    :
              9870894  Machina    The objective of this research is to explore the analytical
              robustness of the classical maximization hypotheses - more specifically, to
              determine the extent to which its analytics and comparative statics extend
              beyond the class of preference-maximizing choice functions, via the formal
              definition, characterization and application of the notion of "local
              preference-maximization."    The concept of local preference-maximization is
              directed at well-defined choice functions which cannot be represented by a
              fixed underlying preference ranking.   Different definitions of this concept
              are developed and used to extend the classical preference-maximization
              framework to the comparative statistics of differential changes in available
              sets.  The potential impact of this research is that it would allow for local
              and global extensions o classical maximization-based comparative statitics
              analysis top choice functions which are not generated by underlying preference
              relations, such as aggregate demand/supply functions, or choice functions
              generated by collective mechanisms.  This research is also motivated by, and
              has potential impact for the analysis of  violations of classical choice theory
              such as systematic intransitivities, cancellation effects, similarity effects
              and response mode effects in a manner that retains as much as possible of the
              concepts, intuition and analytical results of the classical
              preference-maximization framework.    ??
