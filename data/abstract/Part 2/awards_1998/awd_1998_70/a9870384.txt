Abstract    :
              A number of physical problems involve localized phenomena
that move in time,
              such as fluid fronts, interfaces and shocks.
Often, these phenomena are not
              captured well by finite difference
methods on uniform grids.  The
              investigators work on three
classes of such problems: flow in porous media,
              particularly
chemically enhanced aquifer remediation; thin film flow
              with
fluid fronts due to vanishing diffusive fluxes; and excitable
media,
              particularly the modeling of the propagation of electrical
impulses in the
              heart.  All three of these problems involve
diffusion; the diffusion can be
              nonlinear, subdiffusive or
superdiffusive.  The investigators develop
              efficient multilevel
iterative methods and adaptive mesh refinement tools to
              solve
these problems on parallel processor machines.
     The power of
              computers has dramatically increased  since
they were introduced a half
              century ago, and this improvement in
performance continues at a breathtaking
              pace.  Nonetheless,
although the public is generally unaware of this,
              the
computational resources required to simulate many phenomena, like
the
              weather, greatly exceed those currently available.  One way
to obtain a lot of
              computer power is to arrange for many
computers to work simultaneously on a
              problem.  However, it is a
daunting task to program these computers so that
              they will
correctly produce the desired simulation in a timely fashion. 
              In
this work, the investigators develop effective methods to use
many
              computers working together to simulate the flow of
contaminants in the ground,
              the behavior of thin films, and the
electrophysiology of the heart. 
              Groundwater contamination is a
significant environmental problem.   Thin film
              problems arise in
lubrication and in manufacturing processes.  A
              fundamental
understanding of the electrical and muscular behavior of
              the
heart is important and could lead to better control of the
mechanisms of
              arrhythmia.
