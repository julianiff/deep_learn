Abstract    :
              This is a two year accomplishment based renewal of award ANI-9415552 to  improve
              TCP to operate at the much higher speeds than those for which it  was
              originally designed.  The research continues to focus on congestion  behavior
              including TCP transient dynamics, differentiated services,  autotuning, TCP
              clocking and Internet measurement and diagnosis.
