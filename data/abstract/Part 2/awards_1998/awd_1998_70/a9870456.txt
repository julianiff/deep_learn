Abstract    :
              ECS-9870456  Nicoletti    Protection for power transformers against large
              currents, known as arc currents, is commonly based on differential relays. 
              These relays are used on transformers of the size 20 MVA and up, which accounts
              for approximately 40% of the transformers used in electricity distribution in
              this country.  The protection of these transformers is important because the
              cost of replacing such a transformer is $1-5 per kVA.    While these relays do
              offer protection, there are substantial difficulties in application.  The aim
              of this research to is to develop a new and sophisticated signal processing
              algorithm based on wavelets that will reliably detect internal faults in a way
              that will provide rapid detection not effected by inrush currents.  A brief
              review of the theory of wavelets is provided along with some preliminary
              results of simulations.  It is shown that wavelets, along with percentage
              energy contained in certain time-frequency tiles, show promise for the task at
              hand.    The proposed research has two major phases.  Phase I is the
              development of algorithms that will distinguish inrush versus arc currents. 
              Phase II is the design and testing of a prototype system that will implement
              the algorithms developed in Phase I in a way that is as close to the industrial
              set-up as possible.    The PI plans to bring her strengths and expertise from
              the materials and signal processing areas into the electrical power systems
              which can benefit from her knowledge.  A POWRE grant will provide the essential
              equipment, supplies and time to help keep the PI focused in her new research
              ventures
