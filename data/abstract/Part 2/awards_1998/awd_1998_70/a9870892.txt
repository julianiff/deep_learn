Abstract    :
                Millions of dollars are lost when people fail to negotiate effectively.
              Ineffective conflict resolution takes its toll not only on negotiators'
              pocketbooks, but interpersonal relationships as well.  There is some indication
              that people are aware of the need for more effective negotiation skills.  It is
              commonly advertised that negotiation training, specifically through two-year
              MBA programs, can save executives and their companies hundreds of thousands of
              dollars through the creation of `win-win` deals and the avoidance of costly
              strikes.  But are these courses effective? How do we ensure that students will
              access the principles they've learned in the classroom when they need them in
              the real world?  Our research will examine the effectiveness of negotiation
              training methods.  The practical purpose of this research is to develop
              instructional and educational strategies that facilitate remote transfer, or
              people's ability to retrieve the right information when approaching a novel
              situation.
