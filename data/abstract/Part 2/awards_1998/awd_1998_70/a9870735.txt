Abstract    :
              9870735  Cameron    Funds are requested to provide travel support for six
              scientists to participate in a symposium and workshop organized for the 13th
              International Congress of the International Union for the Study of Social
              Insects (IUSSI) to be held in Adelaide, Australia, 29 December 1998 - 4 January
              1999.  This Congress, held once every four or five years, is the only
              international forum devoted exclusively to research on social insects.  The
              planned symposium, entitled "Tribal Phylogeny of the Corbiculate bees: An
              Evaluation of Diverse Data Sets", will focus on the phylogeny of this important
              group of insects, which includes the honey bees and stingless bees with their
              elaborate social behavior, and the social bumble bees and mostly solitary
              orchid bees.  For both practical and theoretical reasons this group is
              receiving intensive phylogenetic and behavioral study.  Presentations by
              scientists from different parts of the world, featuring recent advances in the
              use of molecular data, the development of new morphological character sets and
              advanced approaches to combining diverse data sets will enhance further
              research progress and foster international collaboration.  In conjunction with
              the symposium, a workshop will be devoted to discussion of future critical
              research areas, and to the coordination of an effort to establish a WWW
              relational database of phylogenetic information on the corbiculate bees. 
              Preliminary investigation of TreeBASE, the first database developed to store
              and retrieve published phylogenetic trees and their underlying data matrices,
              indicates that it is the best, and only, database available to date for storing
              and accessing phylogenetic knowledge.  Because of the great expense associated
              with travel to Australia, support is requested to ensure that the invited
              speakers and workshop leaders are able to participate in this important
              meeting.
