POWRE/CISE:
              Program-based Testing of Parallel Programs

The proposed visiting
              professorship is an opportunity for the PI to advance the career as a
              researcher and educator in program analysis-based software engineering.  In
              addition to advancing the PI's knowledge and experience in this area, the PI
              will be in a position to add new courses to the University of Delaware
              curriculum.  From the technical point of view, the goals of the proposal are to
              design, implement, and evaluate more extensive program-based testing techniques
              for parallel programs.  The objective is to use data flow and trace information
              and develop novel analysis techniques to automatically generate program-based
              test and analyze the test coverage of parallel program, respectively.  The
              proposed research is divided into: (i) extension and further development
              techniques for automatic test path generaton for data flow testing of parallel
              programs of different programming models (ii) experimental evaluation of the
              fault detection capability and (iii) investigation of data flow and program
              slicing approaches.
