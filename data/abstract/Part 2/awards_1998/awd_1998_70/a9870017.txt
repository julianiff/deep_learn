Abstract    :
              An exact treatment of the electron propagator is used to compute radiative and
              binding corrections in atoms.  In contrast to most applications in quantum
              field theory, perturbation techniques fail for atoms of high Z.  The current
              research develops and applies these non-perturbative techniques to the Lamb
              shift, to QED effects in heavy ions and to radiative corrections in neutral
              Cs.
