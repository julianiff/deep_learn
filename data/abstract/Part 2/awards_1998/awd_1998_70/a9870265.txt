Abstract    :
              9870265  Readey    The goal of the project is to gain a fundamental 
              understanding of the active gas corrosion of ceramics.  This  research will
              study the high temperature corrosion of  ceramics by halogen-containing gases,
              initially hydrogen  chloride (HCl).  There exist very few data on active
              gaseous  corrosion of ceramics; that is, corrosion in which the  products of
              the reaction are generally gaseous.  However,  those data that do exist show
              that gas diffusion of the  product gases controls the rate of reaction at high 
              temperature.  As a result, the rate of corrosion can be  predicted from
              thermodynamic data and the kinetic theory of  gases. Hydrogen chloride will be
              used as the initial  reactant gas since the equilibrium product gas pressures 
              produced in reactions with it are predicted to be high over  a large
              temperature range, and thus it should be possible to  observe the transition
              from diffusion-controlled kinetics to  surface reaction-controlled kinetics. 
              Once the parameter  space where a surface reaction is rate controlling is 
              defined, then the mechanisms of the surface reaction can be  studied.  The
              reaction kinetics will be followed by weight  loss measurements and grain
              boundary grooving as a function  of temperature and gas composition.  Single
              and  multicomponent oxides, nitrides, and carbides will be  studied.  %%%  The
              significance of the research is that halogen corrosion  of ceramics has
              important technical implications in chemical  processing, incinerators,
              chemical waste disposal,  semiconductor processing, and high temperature heat
              engines.  Understanding the kinetics can help materials engineers  design
              materials that are less subject to degradation by  these gases.  ***
