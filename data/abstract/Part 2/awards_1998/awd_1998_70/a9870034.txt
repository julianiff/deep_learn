Abstract    :
                  9870034  Fisk    This  experimental condensed matter physics project 
              investigates  ground  states  which lie near the Kondo insulator ground  state,
               which  has  a  ratio  of  conduction  electron  concentration  to  occupied 
              magnetic  orbitals  e/f  =  1.  The  hypothesis   being  investigated is that
              intermediate valence states lie near  e/f  =  1,  as  well  as  the  heavy
              Fermion superconducting  state.  The  experimental  program  will  study  doped
               UBe13,   CeIn3   under  pressure,  the  alloy series Sr1-xSmx B6 and single 
              crystals  of  various  intermediate  valence materials.  Temperature  dependent
               transport, thermodynamic and optical properties will be  studied.  The
              research provides excellent training for graduate students in  the areas of
              materials synthesis and characterization.  %%%  This  experimental  condensed
              matter  physics  program  seeks  to  understand  how  the  loss of magnetism in
              a compound,  happening  through changing pressure applied to the compound or
              changing the  chemistry of the compound, leads to essentially new properties of
               such  compounds, most notably superconductivity.  The  hypothesis  around 
              which  the  experiments are organized is  that  the  most  interesting 
              physical properties occur near where the  number  of  charge  carriers  equals 
              the number of  magnetic  sites  in  the  compound.  Magnetic,   electrical  and
               optical  properties   are  measured.  The  work  is addressing questions 
              important  to  the  physics of high temperature superconductivity, as well as 
              exotic  magnetically  based superconductors and insulators. The  research 
              provides excellent training for graduate students in the areas of  materials
              synthesis and characterization.  ***
