Thurston-Nielsen theory and Fluid Mixing

Philip Boyland

The
              Thurston-Nielsen theory provides a powerful collection of tools to
analyze and
              understand two-dimensional dynamical systems.  The theory
has potential for
              significant advances in the study of two-dimensional
systems of physical
              interest.  Among the most interesting and important
come from fluid mechanics.
               Dr. Boyland will use Thurston-Nielsen
theory in conjunction with other
              dynamical tools to obtain a deeper
understanding of two-dimensional fluid
              mixing.  Various mathematical
extensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory will
              be obtained.  These
extensions would enhance the applicability of the theory
              as well as
being of intrinsic mathematical interest.  In addition, numerical
              and
laboratory experiments are proposed with the goal of designing
effective
              mixers and understanding many vortices as a model for
two-dimensional
              turbulence.

The mixing of different species of materials is extremely common
              in
natural systems and industrial applications.  The main scientific
question
              is to understand how the mixing takes place, while in
industrial applications
              the focus is usually on the development of
schemes for effective mixing.  In
              many applications high viscosity,
sensitivity of materials, the need to avoid
              foaming, and other
constraints make turbulence mixing infeasible and
              undesirable.  Thus in
most instances the design of useful mixing procedures
              requires close
attention to efficiency.  The added mathematical understanding
              made
possible by this project should help in this design process,
              providing
novel ideas for efficient mixing procedures and helping to
              eliminate
inefficient ones prior to expensive experimentation. In addition,
              this
project will make a powerful body of pure mathematics more
              accessible
for application to problems of physical and industrial
              importance.
