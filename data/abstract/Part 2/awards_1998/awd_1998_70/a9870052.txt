This award supports the research of Frank Garvan in number
              theory and combinatorics.  In particular three partition problems will be
              studied.  At the most basic level partition  theory deals with the problem of
              counting the number of ways a number can be written as a sum of smaller
              numbers.  The theory of partition has had important connections with other
              branches of number theory such as the theory of modular functions.  It has also
              had important applications to physics particularly statistical mechanics. 
              

Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,
              addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole
              number by another.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
              pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within  the
              last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications
              in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems. 
              Modular functions are functions with highly symmetric properties.  One main
              goal of this work is to apply the classical theory of modular functions in a
              non-standard way to some problems in partition theory.
