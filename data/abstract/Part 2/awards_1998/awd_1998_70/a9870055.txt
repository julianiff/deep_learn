Abstract    :
              DeSalle  9870055     Genetic changes have produced novel biochemical functions
              during the course of evolution.  This study addresses the way in which these
              changes have occurred using nuclear receptor proteins.  The superfamily of
              nuclear receptor proteins comprises over 50 related transcription factors that
              regulate reproduction, development, metamorphosis, and the maintenance of
              homeostasis in a broad range of animal taxa from jellyfish to humans.  The
              superfamily includes receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones (including
              estrogen and testosterone), retinoic acids, vitamin D, and insect ecdysteroids,
              as well as a large number of orphan receptors, the ligands for which receptors
              are unknown or may not exist.  Despite extensive information on nuclear
              receptor function, the evolutionary history of this group of physiologically
              important genes is obscure.   This research project seeks to elucidate the
              history with the following specific aims:  1) reconstruction of the
              phylogenetic relationships among the nuclear receptors using parsimony-based
              analysis of existing molecular sequence data;  2) generation of molecular
              sequence information for steroid receptor sequences from several species of
              lamprey, the most ancient extant vertebrate lineage, in order to specify when
              specific proteins evolved through duplication and divergence events, and to
              provide data for a comparative analysis of the evolution of steroid receptor
              protein sequences; and 3) characterization of the mechanisms and dynamics by
              which genetic change has produced novel functions among the steroid receptors,
              by analyzing in a phylogenetic context the correlated evolution of molecular
              and functional characters, the rate of divergence, and the patterns of genomic
              organization in this important and well-studied class of proteins.
