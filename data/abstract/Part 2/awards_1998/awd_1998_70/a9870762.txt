Abstract    :
                This research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, focuses on the further  development of the scanning electrochemical
              microscope for studying electron transfer kinetics at liquid/liquid  interfaces
              and at the surfaces of new organic and inorganic materials.  Professor Bard and
              his students at the  University of Texas at Austin first developed this method.
               In this project near-field scanning optical microscopy  and quartz crystal
              microbalance measurements will also be employed to simultaneously study
              photochemical and  electrochemical reactions with high spatial and temporal
              resolution.  A new thrust will focus on applying these  methods to characterize
              electron transfer reactions occurring at membranes.    There is a need to be
              able to characterize the kinetics of electron transfer processes that occur at
              spatially isolated  sites on surfaces.  Professor Bard and his students at the
              University of Texas at Austin have pioneered the  development of scanning
              electrochemical microscopy and used it to address this and other problems.  One
              focus  of this project is developing this technique for the detection of single
              molecules at interfaces and surfaces.   Electrodes of nanometer dimension have
              been prepared for these experiments revealing discrete electronic energy 
              levels due to the extremely small dimensions probed by electrodes of such small
              size.  This work has a valuable  fundamental component with exciting potential
              applications in measurements that require molecular scale resolution.
