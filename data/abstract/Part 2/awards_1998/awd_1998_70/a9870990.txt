Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The University of   Notre Dame to
              acquire a computer-controlled electron paramagnetic   resonance (EPR)
              spectrometer with variable temperature capabilities. This   equipment will
              enhance research which span a wide range of activities,   from characterization
              of paramagnetic transition metal complexes   including porphyrin and related
              complexes, single crystal studies, and   studies of organometallic cluster
              species and metal ions in biochemical   complexes and spin label applications. 
              An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument   used
              to obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure   of
              molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the   lifetimes of
              free radicals which are often essential for the initiation   of tumor growth
              and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
