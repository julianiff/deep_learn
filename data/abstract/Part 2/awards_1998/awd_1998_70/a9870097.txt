Abstract    :
              9870097  Krishna    The order Isoptera (termites) comprises about 2,300
              described and  several hundred undescribed species (living and fossil),
              classified into  6 families, 12 subfamilies, and 290 genera.  In spite of its
              comparatively  small size, because the order has generated great interest, a
              massive  body of literature has been produced on all aspects of termite
              biology.  Aside from their notorious inportance as insect pests, termites,
              because  of their intricate social biology and their critical importance in the
               ecosystem as recyclers of cellulose, have attracted the attention of a wide 
              range of researchers in many fields: evolutionary biology, ecology,  behavior,
              physiology, economic biology, genetics, cytology, and other  areas of
              investigation.  The aim of this project is to create a taxonomic  database of
              the termites of the world.  The database (and the printed  volume derived from
              it) will provide complete and up-to-date references  to all systematic,
              zoogeographical, and biological information available  for each species of
              Isoptera.  The database will be put on line on the  World-Wide Web, where it
              will provide comprehensive and current  information to biologists around the
              world and will serve as a global  data bank for the future.
