A high -speed imaging system consisting of a high-speed,
              continuous access framing camera and a coherent, collimated, monochromatic and
              pulsed light source operated in conjunction with the camera is to be acquired. 
              This system represents a fundamental upgrade of the high-speed imaging
              capabilities of the Photomechanics Laboratory and would support research and
              development in engineering and sciences.  The new high-speed imaging system
              would be utilized to investigate various high loading rate and stress wave
              dominated physical phenomenon.  

The advanced capabilities of the new high
              speed imaging system will be utilized to investigate catastrophic decohesion of
              ceramic-metal interfaces subjected to dynamic loading.  Real time experiments
              will be conducted using interferometry based optical techniques such as
              Coherent Gradient Sensing.  MoirÚ and Twyman-Green interferometry to
              investigate various aspects of the fracture of ceramic/metal bimaterial
              interfaces.  Dynamic loading would be achieved either by projectile impact in a
              one point bend configuration or by detonation of explosive.
