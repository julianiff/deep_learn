Abstract    :
              9870231  Harder  (NOTE:  Collaborative - abstract identical to Sterling,
              9870232)    The Government of Viet Nam hopes to substantially increase the size
              of their protected area system by the year 2005.  As they continue to enter the
              market economy, inevitable conflicts arise between use and conservation of
              natural resources.  For this reason, the Center for Biodiversity and
              Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History and the Missouri
              Botanical Garden have joined with the Institute of Ecology and Biological
              Resources and the Viet Nam National University in Ha Noi to to develop the
              knowledge and expertise necessary to protect Viet Nam's most important and
              endangered ecosystems.  Our project aims to conduct inventories of plants and
              little-known animals in key ecosystems in order to assess their importance for
              conservation. In these same key areas, we will study population growth,
              cultural practices as they impinge on biological resources, and land use to
              predict how and when resource use will impact the areas in the future.   We
              will then formulate recommendations to the government regarding conservation
              measures for the key areas.  As part of this program, we will also initiate
              joint training, education and institutional development programs to increase
              the capacity within Viet Nam to pursue such studies in the future.
