Abstract    :
              9870173  Cifelli    The Early Cretaceous (about 140 to 100 million years ago)
              represents a pivotal time period in Earth history: many modern groups of
              animals (such as higher mammals, lizards, birds, and amphibians) appeared or
              underwent their earliest radiations. The source of this change is not well
              understood, but it is thought to be linked to dramatic changes in the flora
              that resulted from the appearance of flowering plants, to climatic change, and
              to immigration events between major landmasses such as North America  and Asia.
                Existing data for interpreting the mid-Cretaceous change is extremely slim 
              because the fossil record for this time period is so poor. The proposed project
              focuses on the recovery of diverse vertebrate assemblages from the Antlers and
              Cloverly formations, both of which are believe to be about 110 million years
              old. The project involves a 3-year program of collecting and curation, using
              diverse methods in order to maximize sampling of all vertebrate groups.
              Preliminary investigations suggest that a total of 70-100 species, represented
              by about 5,000 specimens, will be recovered, including about 20 that will be
              diagnosable as new to science. Results of the project will be made available
              through loan of specimens to interested investigators, distribution of cast
              sets to relevant institutions  worldwide, and placement of specimen data
              (together with images) on the WWW. Educational aspects of the project include
              graduate and undergraduate research, and involvement of both students and
              members of the community in all aspects of field, laboratory, and research
              activities.   The collection and its data will constitute a major research
              resource that will be of general interest. The specimens will provide new
              evidence as to the origin, relationships, and biogeography of diverse kinds of
              vertebrates. More broadly, the resource will provide evidence for natural
              processes that affect diversity--such as the nature and magnitude of 
              plant-animal interactions, and the effects of co ntinental-scale immigration on
              North America's native fauna.
