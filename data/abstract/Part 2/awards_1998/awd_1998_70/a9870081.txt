Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within
              it.  This proposal represents a partnership  between university scientists and
              educators, teachers and  the K-12 classrooms in a large urban area (in this
              case, the  Los Angeles Unified School District) that will provide a  science
              theme based on existing GLOBE protocols and the  development of new protocols
              designed to investigate and  understand the complexities of measuring
              environmental  variables (e.g. the existing GLOBE protocols for  temperature,
              precipitation, hydrology, soil  characterization, etc.) within an urban
              microenvironment,  and of providing a consistent science curriculum for a 
              highly mobile population.  While GLOBE has achieved a wide geographic
              distribution  within the United States, future growth in the program will 
              likely occur within urban areas with issues peculiar to that  setting.  Urban
              areas also have the highest school 'dropout'  rate from the GLOBE Program (50%,
              with fewer actually  reporting), and this project will identify some of the 
              causes of this serious problem.  This proposal will address  this programmatic
              need and provide a model for use in other  large urban areas of the United
              States.                                                    |<ú +?+¬
