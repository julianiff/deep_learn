Abstract    :
                          9870033  Edidin     The focus of this project is intersection theory
              on  quotient moduli spaces that arise in algebraic geometry. This includes
              using localization methods on moduli spaces of vector bundles to study surface
              invariants, as well as calculating integral Chow rings of moduli stacks of
              curves and vector bundles. We also consider the problems of determining which
              stacks are quotient stacks and of  obtaining an explicit Riemann-Roch formula
              for singular quotient schemes.  Much of the work will use the equivariant
              intersection theory developed jointly by the principal investigator and W.
              Graham.        This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic 
              geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has
              had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it
              treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations,
              namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
              algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding 
              application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer
              science, and robotics.
