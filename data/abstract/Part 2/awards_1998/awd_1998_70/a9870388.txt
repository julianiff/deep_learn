This project supports the research activities of the PI as a  Visiting
              Researcher at the University of  Washington.  The award enables the PI to
              return to a stimulating research environment after several years of full-time
              involvement in education, and to take the first step towards diversifying her
              research, crucial for continued professional growth.  The visit will also
              enable her to build invaluable ties with a strong research university, and
              thereby benefit her home institution.  The research objective is to gain
              proficiency in probabilistic and on-line techniques, for which there is
              abundant expertise at the chosen host institution.  The PI proposes to apply
              her expertise in MANets by (i)developing probabilistic graph models for MANets
              to support systematic simulation studies, and (ii) exploring probabilistic and
              on-line algorithms for routing in MANets.
