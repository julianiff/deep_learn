Project INSTAR is a three-phased teacher enhancement program. 
              The first phase is an annual field-intensive two-week summer Science Teacher
              Institute.  This Institute is followed by regular academic year training and
              participation in the GLOBE Program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit
              the Environment), a global environmental education program that encourages
              science inquiry skills and coordinates data collection and entry by students
              into an international data base through the Internet.  During these two phases,
              science teachers work collaboratively in teams with research scientists and
              experienced master teachers to improve their knowledge and skills in the
              content area, develop appropriate and useful activities and materials to use in
              the classroom, and distribute this knowledge base throughout their home
              schools.  They gain scientific knowledge about their local environment, and
              learn data collection techniques and the use of technological tools to conduct
              research.  The 1998 Dade county middle school Teacher Institute focused on four
              active research programs in South Florida - coral reefs, biotoxins, hydrology,
              and beach renourishment.  The third phase of the program provides training in
              geographic information systems (GIS), a technology tool that allows teachers to
              geographically analyze, interpret, and process the data collected in the first
              two phases of the program.  Project INSTAR includes instructional materials and
              equipment kits that can be readily integrated into classroom learning and
              teaching, and offers teaches the opportunity to exercise leadership, teaching,
              and inquiry skills to help change the way they teach and ultimately the way
              their students learn science.
