Research focused on understanding the properties of
              pions and eta mesons and their interactions with nucleons will be performed.
              The two major objectives are: (1) measurements of the cross sections for
              production of eta and eta-prime mesons with photons incident on hydrogen and
              deuterium, and (2) a precise measurement of the decay rate for the pion beta
              decay process.  The measurements will yield stringent tests of our
              understanding of the properties of these mesons, quark-lepton universality, and
              radiative corrections within the Standard Model.  Both experiments are high
              priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics and studies of fundamental
              symmetries.  Development, construction, and utilization of major
              state-of-the-art equipment is integral to this activity. Education of graduate
              students is a strong component in every aspect of this grant.
