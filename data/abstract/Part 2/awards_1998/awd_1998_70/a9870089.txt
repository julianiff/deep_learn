Abstract    :
                  Pradhan, Anil  AST-9870089      Dr. Pradhan continues work on the Iron
              Project, an international collaboration whose goal is the development and
              application of theoretical and computational methods aimed at large-scale ab
              initio quantum mechanical atomic calculations for heavy elements of the iron
              group.  The research includes inter-related components of theory, computations,
              and applications.  The theoretical effort is directed toward major applications
              in astronomical spectroscopy, with a focus on stellar atmospheric models,
              emission from Fe in photoionized nebulae and active galactic nuclei and
              quasars.   ***
