Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of poly-l-proline type II   peptide
              mimics and the use of these mimics as kinase substrates with the   goal of
              better defining the primary and secondary structure parameters   which
              contribute to the substrate specificity of protein kinases.    Construction of
              PPII mimics will utilize conformational control elements   which define an
              all-proline PPII helix.  This will involve the synthesis   of modified proline
              analogs possessing the non-prolyl side chains on the   proline backbone and the
              generation of oligopeptides from these modified   prolines.    With this new
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is   supporting the
              research of Dr. Jose S. Madalengoitia of the Department of   Chemistry at the
              University of Vermont.  Professor Madalengoitia will   focus his work on
              probing the hypothesis that at least some protein   kinases phosphorylate
              peptide strands in the PPII conformation, or in   extended conformations
              resembling this geometry.  High impact in an   important area of current
              biology will occur with the success of this   project.
