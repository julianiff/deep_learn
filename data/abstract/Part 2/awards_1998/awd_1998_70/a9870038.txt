Collisions of heavy nuclei that are accelerated to high energies
              make it possible to create in the laboratory a nuclear matter with high
              excitation, large compression, and appreciable difference in the proton and
              neutron numbers.  Knowledge of the properties of nuclear matter under such
              extreme conditions is not only interesting in itself but also useful in our
              understanding of astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions, neutron
              star properties, nuclear synthesis, and the evolution of early universe.  In
              this proposal, various theoretical models will be used to study the properties
              of such a matter. Also, we shall continue to develop a relativistic transport
              model to describe the space-time evolution of heavy ion collision dynamics by
              including the predicted properties of hot dense matter, the different behavior
              between protons and neutrons, and the quark-gluon substructure of the nucleon.
              The transport model will be useful for studying heavy ion collisions at both
              existing accelerators and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider being constructed
              at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as the Radioactive Beam Facility
              that is being proposed. Comparing the theoretical predictions with the
              experimental observations will allow us to extract information on nuclear
              matter properties that have not been known before.
