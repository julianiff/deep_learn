Abstract    :
              The proposed study will use ground-based data to examine the signature of a
              substorm as seen in the ionosphere.  The PI will then map those signatures into
              the magnetosphere using magnetic field models such as the Tsyganenko T89 model.
               They will then examine in situ data from satellites such as Geotail and WIND
              to look for magnetospheric signatures that correspond to the ground-based
              signatures.  This study is oriented specifically toward a the GEM working group
              that is attempting to define the morphology of a substorm independent of any
              substorm model.  This GEM working group was approved by the GEM steering
              committee at the 1997 Snowmass GEM workshop.
