Abstract    :
              9870435  Miller  The addition of disinfectants such as free chlorine to 
              drinking water can greatly increase corrosion of the  distribution system
              pipes.  Many small communities which do  not currently disinfect their drinking
              water may soon need  to do so under the proposed Ground Water Disinfection
              Rule.  It is anticipated that the sudden addition of a strong  oxidant such as
              free chlorine will lead to additional  corrosion of the aged iron pipes found
              in these small water  systems, but this area of water chemistry has not been
              well  studied.  In this project, several traditional and newer  corrosion
              assessment techniques will be applied to the study  of iron corrosion.  Pipe
              loop studies will be combined with  electrochemical analysis and material
              (scale) analysis to  give a more complete understanding of the chemistry of
              water  distribution systems, including the chemistry of scales.  It  is
              anticipated that the results of this project will help  the water community to
              better interactions between oxidants  and pipe scale.    This project will
              allow the P.I. to develop experience in  the use of analytical techniques which
              have traditionally  not been applied to the study of corrosion in aged pipes. 
              The electrochemical analytical work, in particular, will  expand the research
              capabilities of the P.I., and will allow  her to do future work involving
              electrochemistry and the  application of this field to Environmental
              Engineering.  ***
