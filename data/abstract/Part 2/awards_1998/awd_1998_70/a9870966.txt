Abstract    :
              Proposal No:                 9870966   Proposal Type:             Request for
              Conference Support Principal Investigator:    G. Glenn Lipscomb  Affiliation:  
                              University of Toledo        This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport
              and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The
              principal investigator is Dr. Y.S. Lin at the University of Cincinnati. The
              conference is the Meeting of the North American Membrane Society, to be held 
              May 16-20, 1998, in Cleveland, Ohio. The grant will provide travel support to
              graduate students who will be presenting their work at the conference.     
              This is a topical area fully relevant to the Interfacial, Transport and
              Separation Processes Program.  The conference is an excellent forum for the
              latest advances in membrane science and technology, and brings together the
              leading researchers in the area. Graduate students whose research is in
              membrane science will benefit immensely from attending the conference and
              presenting their research. . A very useful aspect of the conference is the
              organization of two workshops that are directly related to graduate student
              career development. The first is a roundtable discussion led by senior graduate
              students to discuss research, thesis and career experiences. The second is a
              discussion led by academic, industrial and government leaders in the membrane
              field again targeted towards student career opportunities. Facilitating
              graduate student participation in  the conference will enhance the country's
              research infrastructure in membrane science and technology.
