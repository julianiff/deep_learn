Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Professor Linda
              Peteanu of Carnegie-Mellon University.  The research aims to extend the
              techniques currently existing in her laboratory to a new area, materials
              science, and to augment her experimental work with electronic structure
              calculations.  Electroabsorption measurements will be made on polar polyenes
              using Stark-effect spectroscopy.

The opportunity afforded through the POWRE
              program will enhance Professor Peteanu's research potential as well as her
              educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists. 
              Peteanu's investigations will explore the source of discrepancies between
              experimentally measured and computed electronic properties for polar polyenes,
              which can be large if solvation effects are not adequately accounted for.  The
              results of this research will provide a better understanding of the non-linear
              optical properties of polymers and glasses.  This work could ultimately benefit
              not only manufacturing but also an understanding of the photochemistry of
              biological molecules in a protein environment.
