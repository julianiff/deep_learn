Abstract    :
              9870561 Marr The objective of this research is to establish a foundation for the
              verification of in situ bioremediation. The proposed research will test the
              hypothesis that the molecular biology tools of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
              and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) can be used to monitor the
              succession of microbial populations associated with in situ biodegradation of
              chlorinated solvents. PCR and DGGE have been successfully applied to natural
              microbial communities to elucidate microbial diversity and identify the
              specific populations present in uncontaminated aquatic, sediment and soil
              environments. Specific objectives are to 1) optimize the application of PCR and
              DGGE to distinguish microbial species in uncontaminated methanotrophic soil, 2)
              simultaneously monitor trichloroethylene degradation and species diversity as
              measured by DGGE resolution of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA and 3) identify the
              predominant species over time via type-specific phylogenetic and catabolic gene
              probes and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The ultimate impact of this research
              will be to enhance our knowledge of bioremediation and to provide tools to
              monitor and optimize operating conditions during in situ bioremediation of
              contaminated groundwater sites. This project will allow the PI to take a
              leadership position among researchers in the area of disinfection processes by
              focusing her research in an area were there are significant knowledge gaps
