Chaotic dynamics has been a fertile area of mathematical
              research in 
recent years, and chaos has now been observed in many scientific
              fields.  
Much of the progress to date in the study of chaotic dynamics has
              focused 
on low-dimensional systems, and many phenomena are well understood in
              
certain low-dimensional cases.  Even when systems with higher-
dimensional
              state spaces are considered, often the dynamics takes place on 
a
              low-dimensional attractor (by "low", we mean up to dimension 2 for 
maps and 3
              for flows).  This proposal seeks to explore how some of the 
phenomena
              associated with chaotic dynamical systems extend to cases 
that are
              fundamentally higher-dimensional -- that is, when the system is 
expanding in
              more than one dimension, or in other
words has more than one positive Lyapunov
              exponent.

Higher-dimensional chaos can occur in models of many engineering
              
devices and in meteorological models and climate models.  This research
              
will tell us, for example, if mathematical models can suddenly get trapped
              
in artificial windows of regular behavior.  These windows would be
              
artificial in that any realistic level of noise would disrupt the regular
              
behavior.  Our research will also shed light on the reliability of computer
              
simulations for higher dimensional models. This study is critical to
              
realistic modeling of complex systems.
