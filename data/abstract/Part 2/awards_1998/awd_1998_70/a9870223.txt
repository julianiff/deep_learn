This work consists of two projects that investigate
              fundamental problems in experimental quantum optics.   One project will examine
              the origin and character of laser gain in coherently driven systems.  
              Experiments will determine whether driven atom gain is actually controlled,
              enhanced or diminished by experimental tailoring of the ambient vacuum.  The
              second project is the development of an apparatus for the trapping and cooling
              of atomic ytterbium.  Blue cooling followed by green trapping will provide a
              low temperature sample of two-level-like atoms for use in quantum optics
              studies and in diverse cold atom work.
