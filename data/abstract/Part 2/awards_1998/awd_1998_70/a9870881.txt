Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9870881  S. Webber/U. Texas    The goal of this proposal is
              preparation, characterization and utilization of novel interface structures
              based on block copolymers attached to surfaces.  The self-assembling tendency
              of block copolymers will be exploited.  The project will include (1) synthesis
              of various block copolymers (some with fluorescent tags) by anionic
              polymerization; (2) preparation and characterization of micelles formed by
              these copolymers; (3) attachment of these micelles to various surfaces; (4)
              modification of the micelle-coated surfaces by various processing steps such as
              solvent and/or temperature cycling; (5) characterization of the surfaces by an
              array of techniques; (6) studying the interaction of the dry surfaces with
              various vapors and of the submerged interfaces with soluble probes.  It is
              surmised that, besides the intrinsic interest in these novel structures, the
              project may lead to valuable advances in the fields of chemical sensing,
              optical data storage and drug delivery. The principal investigator has had
              extensive experience in most of the techniques proposed.  Most of the equipment
              and instrumentation needed is either routinely used in the PI labs or is
              readily available within the University of Texas.  ***
