              ABSTRACT     CTS-9870984  Arthur H. Heuer, Gary A. Michal Case Western Reserve
              University    Title: Acquisition of an Environmental Scanning Electron
              Microscope    The Center for Surface Analysis of Materials at CWRU will
              purchase a Philips XL30 LaB6 ESEM with tensile, cooling, and heating stages.
              Experiments at in situ conditions will permit dynamic studies of chemical
              reactions and phase transformations, and imaging of mechanical straining for
              studies of deformation, fatigue and fracture of monolithic and composite
              materials. Cost-sharing of over 44% is provided by the university. The primary
              users will be 18 faculty members of Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and Dental
              and Medical Schools.
