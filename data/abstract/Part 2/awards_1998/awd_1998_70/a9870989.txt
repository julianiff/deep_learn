Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program  will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at The University of California in   Berkeley to
              acquire a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass   Spectrometer
              equipped with both electrospray and matrix assisted laser   desorption
              ionization. This equipment will enhance research which   includes pre-design,
              synthesis and study of high symmetry supramolecular   assemblies, synthesis and
              study of transition metal cluster compounds,   stereochemical differentiation
              of metal-coordinated oligosaccharides,   synthesis and study of
              heterobimetallic organometallic complexes,   analysis of semiconductor
              nanocrystals and highly charged dendrimers as   building blocks for
              supramolecular structure.    Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
              vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  Analysis of
              the   multiply charged multiple metal coordinated biomolecules and polymers to 
               be carried out in these studies requires the high mass, high resolution   and
              high mass accuracy available using the combination of fourier   transform ion
              cyclotron mass spectrometry with electrospray and matrix   assisted laser
              desorption ionization.  The acquisition of this capability   in mass
              spectrometry is essential for carrying out frontier research in   many fields
              of chemistry.
