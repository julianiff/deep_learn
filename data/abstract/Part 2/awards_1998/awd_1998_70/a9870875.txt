              Abstract  ATM-9870886  Alley, Richard B.  Pennsylvania State University  Title:
              Laurentide Thermal Instability Modeling    This award supports collaborative
              research at the University of  Chicago and Pennsylvania State University
              designed to develop a  suite of finite-element ice-sheet models to study the
              role of ice  sheets in millennial-scale climate change observed in the geologic
               record.  The main focus of the research will be to understand how  thermal
              instability (i.e., switching from frozen to melted  conditions at the  glacial
              bed) leads to ice-stream and ice-lobe  activity that interacts strongly with
              the surrounding environment,  either as an amplifier of externally forced
              climate change or as an  instigator of  climate change in the atmosphere and
              ocean.  Model  experiments will attempt to resolve the controversy as to
              whether  the cause of Heinrich events and Bond/Lotti events is this thermal 
              triggering mechanism or is the climate cooling seen in the  Greenland ice-core
              records.
