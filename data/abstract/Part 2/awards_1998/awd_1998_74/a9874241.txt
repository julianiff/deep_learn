Abstract    :
              This research project explores new methodologies for combinatorial synthesis and
              screening, based on Fourier transform analysis of one-dimensional libraries
              compiled on various types of threads.  The chemistry involves establishing
              compatible combinations of solid supports (cotton or other threads) and
              reagents appropriate for the synthesis of different types of molecules. 
              Application of the method to protein-binding peptides is proposed, as well as
              study of the binding selectivity of synthetic receptors and further development
              of data collection and analysis.

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Alan W.
              Schwabacher of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.  Dr. Schwabacher is
              exploring ways to make very large numbers of different molecules in minute
              quantities and in a single batch.  This is to be done in such a way that the
              properties of each type of molecule can be evaluated while keeping track of the
              exact structure of each molecule.  This makes possible the evaluation of a
              large number of potentially useful molecules without the need to synthesize
              each one separately, until after its properties are known.
