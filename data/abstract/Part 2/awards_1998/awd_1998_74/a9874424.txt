Abstract    :
              In this CAREER award funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division, de Dios will study NMR chemical shifts in peptides,
              including the use of Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) structure determinations
              of Conus peptides, in order to be able to understand the function of
              biologically important molecules better.  Ab initio calculations of chemical
              shifts will be refined by comparison with known structures and measured shifts
              from the conotoxin molecules.  Two new graduate courses in computational
              chemistry and in NMR spectrocopy will be introduced into the Georgetown
              University curriculum.  Each course will involve both formal lectures on the
              underlying concepts and practical training in the techniques.

The
              relationship between the spectral position of NMR absorption lines and the
              structure of a molecule in its environment is a powerful tool to help elucidate
              the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of biologically important molecules. 
              The current project will help create and test this kind of general tool for
              protein structure refinement.  This technique will help determine molecular
              structures in solution, their natural environment, as opposed to the crystal
              environments required for X-ray structure determination.
