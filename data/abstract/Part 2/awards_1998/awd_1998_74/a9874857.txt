Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports research and education on oxygen transfer reactions by Dr.
              Mahdi M. Abu-Omar of the Chemistry Department, University of California - Los
              Angeles.  New rhenium-based catalysts will be prepared and used to enhance the
              oxygen-transfer chemistry of sulfoxides.  The catalytic reactions of complexes
              of the general formula ReOCl3LL' will be studied in detail using spectroscopic
              and kinetic methods.  Density Functional Theory calculations on model systems
              will be used to understand the catalytic reactivities.  Using the results,
              chiral Re(V) oxazoline complexes that are resistant to degradation will be
              designed in order to promote asymmetric oxo-transfer reactions.  

Efficient
              new catalysts will be developed for the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins by
              sulfoxides.  The educational component of this CAREER Award will focus on
              incorporating contemporary research issues into undergraduate classes in
              inorganic chemistry and new approaches to problem sessions will be developed.
