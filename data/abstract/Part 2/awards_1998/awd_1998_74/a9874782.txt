Abstract    :
              The Resource Center for Science and Engineering, a consortium of the major
              universities in Puerto Rico and the site of Puerto Rico Experimental Program to
              Stimulate Competitive Research, will strengthen the scientific infrastructure
              to a national level of competitiveness in five targeted research areas
              (Biotechnology, Materials Sciences, Engineering Infrastructure, Environmental
              Research, and High Performance Computing).  The EPSCoR Strategic Plan is the
              cornerstone of the Commonwealth's overall plan to strengthen scientific
              research and is one of the key strategies being utilized to enhance Puerto
              Rico's economic competitiveness.  EPSCoR support of research thrust areas will
              strengthen Puerto Rico's scientific research environment by:  1) expanding the
              number of scientists and raising the quality of competitive research in areas
              that are key to Commonwealth's economic advancement; 2) elevating the level and
              number of human resources needed to sustain strong R&D activity; and 3)
              promoting new economic development through an alliance of academia, government
              and industry in Puerto Rico, as well as with mainland entities.  Puerto Rico
              will employ a multifaceted approach to achieve its EPSCoR goals, attain
              national Research and Development standards, and meet local Science and
              Technology requisites for economic stimulation. Infrastructure enhancement
              activities will include:  1) strengthening academic basic research and new
              researchers in the scientific community; 2) fostering levels of national
              competitiveness in the selected research thrust areas; 3) obtaining major
              research instrumentation; 4) developing human resources,
