The broad objective of this CAREER award is to develop research
              and education activities concerning the thermo-mechanical integrity of metal
              interconnects in modern microelectronic devices. Microelectronic failures of
              thermal and mechanical origins are causing increasing concerns as the feature
              dimension shrinks and the structural complexity increases.  Research and
              education plans directly devoted to this issue, from the mechanics and
              materials perspectives, are therefore essential. Specific elements of the
              proposed research include micromechanisms of void nucleation, void growth
              induced stress redistribution, relations between stress-induced voids and
              electromigration voids, processing induced stresses in multilevel
              metallization, interconnect Joule heating, and the thermal-electrical coupling
              in locally damaged interconnects.  Both numerical and experimental techniques
              will be employed.  The education plans include the revision of curricula to
              accommodate this rapidly expanding field, development of cross-disciplinary
              courses bridging the mechanical, materials and electrical aspects of
              microelectronics, and incorporation of research into project-oriented courses. 
              Some parts of computational modeling and software module
development will be
              projects for undergraduate research.

In addition to the technical activities
              of research and education, efforts will also be made to increase the exposure
              of underrepresented ethnic groups, which constitute a large portion of
              population in New Mexico, to research endeavors.  This will be achieved by
              participation in the undergraduate research programs, already in place at The
              University of New Mexico, for encouraging minority students to consider
              graduate study.
