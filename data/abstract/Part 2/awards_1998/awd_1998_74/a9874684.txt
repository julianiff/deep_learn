Abstract    :
              The focus of this study is to identify the ethical dimensions of software
              development projects and the ways that potential negative consequences can be
              mediated. A software development impact statement (SoDIS) will be developed to
              uncover and address ethical dimensions such as privacy, access, security,
              autonomy, safety, and harmfulness.  An "ideal"  SoDIS would be consistent with
              standard development practices and could be incorporated into national and
              international software development standards. This study will: 1) refine the
              conceptual tools for identifying ethical risks;  2) begin examination of means
              to resolve ethical risks; 3) develop a software prototype; 4) identify software
              project management tools currently used in the industry and integrate the
              prototype; and 5) refine the process for incorporation into national and
              international standards.
