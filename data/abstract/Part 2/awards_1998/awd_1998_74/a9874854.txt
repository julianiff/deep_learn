The objectives of this CAREER project are:  (1) to gain
              fundamental understanding of the nucleation of dislocations in crystalline
              materials under near-failure stresses, (2) to apply this understanding broadly
              to issues concerning the mechanical properties and structural integrity of
              materials, and (3) to integrate the activities in the above research areas with
              the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  The research component
              of the project investigates an issue of fundamental importance to mechanical
              properties and structural integrity of crystalline materials, the nucleation of
              dislocations under high stresses.  The research focuses on the experimental
              validation and improvement of the latest autocatalytic nucleation model.  The
              objective of achieving fundamental understanding is accomplished through
              critical experiments to probe in situ the formation of dislocations in
              initially dislocation-free crystals subjected to dynamic loading and heating
              and through analytical and numerical formulations of the autocatalytic
              nucleation mechanism.  The following tasks are performed:  (1) Experimental
              techniques based on electrical resistivity, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and
              reflection electron microscopy for probing in situ the formation and evolution
              of dislocations in crystalline materials; (2) In situ probing techniques to
              examine single crystal specimens that are initially free, or effectively free,
              of dislocations and are subjected to dynamic heating and straining; (3) Models
              of the collective, autocatalytic nucleation of dislocation loops with
              analytical and numerical methods; and (4) Application of the experimental and
              theoretical research to materials properties and issues that are
              defect-sensitive and involve locally concentrated stresses.

The CAREER
              project includes developing an industrially oriented course on materials
              selection to cater to the need of non-materials engineering students, for both
              on-campus students and off-site students at industrial companies and
              structuring the course for distance learning through Internet
              technologies.
