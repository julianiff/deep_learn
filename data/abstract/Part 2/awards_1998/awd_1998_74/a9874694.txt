Abstract    :
              Professor Leckta's multifaceted research efforts explore aspects of asymmetric
              transformations of imines.  These include addition reactions of enol- and
              allylsilanes and ketene silyl acetals to imino esters catalyzed by chiral Lewis
              acids, asymmetric Staudinger and Baylis-Hillman reactions.  Also,  the
              development of novel catalysts based on diborane as a bifunctional Lewis acid
              and (bis)phosphine ligands is being pursued while incorporating computations to
              evaluate and possibly design useful catalytic species.  Creating a bridge
              between the experimental and the theoretical is a hallmark of Professor
              Leckta'a teaching goals, with computational chemistry employed in the
              introductory as well as advanced aspects of his curriculum.  Further, plans are
              being made to include high school teachers with one goal being to develop
              visual aids to pique the interest of high school students.

With this CAREER
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and teaching efforts
              of Dr. Thomas Leckta of Johns Hopkins University.  Professor Leckta's research
              deals with new ways to make nitrogen-containing molecules called amines in such
              a way that the three- dimensional shape or chirality of the molecule is
              controlled.  This is ever more important when designing the synthesis of
              biomolecules and drugs.  Professor Leckta's teaching emphasizes the use of
              computers as a tool for predicting the outcome of chemical reactions before
              time is invested in actually trying the chemistry in the laboratory.  An
              outreach program is being planned that will involve high school teachers and
              provide demonstrations of high-quality graphics and computations to high school
              students.
