Abstract    :
              Bernhard Schlegel is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to develop and apply quantum chemical methods to studies of surface
              reactions in titanium nitride chemical vapor deposition and to classical
              trajectory investigations.  He will carry out a detailed study of the barriers
              and transition states for reactions that govern titanium nitride film growth. 
              Ab initio trajectory techniques will be applied to three-body fragmentation
              processes in organic species, branching ratios in translationally activated
              reactions, and reactions on surfaces with bifurcations.  To make such
              calculations feasible, new computational capabilities will be developed in the
              areas of gradients and hessians, and of cluster embedding.

Chemical vapor
              deposition is an area of enormous chemical and technological importance, yet
              comparatively little is known about the reactions that contribute to film
              growth.  Computational quantum chemistry can provide valuable thermochemical
              and gas phase reactivity data for metallo-organic film growth.  Additionally,
              molecular dynamics provides insights into chemical reactivity that cannot be
              obtained from static calculations of transition states and reaction paths. 
              Together, these projects open new realms of reactions for study that will
              enhance our understanding of surface chemistry.
