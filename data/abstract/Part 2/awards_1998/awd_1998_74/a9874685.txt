Abstract    :
              Three R&D focus areas are selected for enhancement based on their potential for
              contributions to economic development in the state and importance in the future
              vision of strengths at the University of Vermont.  They are:  Advanced
              Materials (electronic materials, sensors, porous solids and polymers along with
              an increased focus on biomaterials); Biotechnology (modern molecular biology
              and genetics to measurement technologies related to biological processes);
              Environmental Science and Engineering (groundwater modeling, field based
              studies and cross departmental and college collaborations).  Programs designed
              to improve competitiveness in the focus areas both at the individual and
              institutional levels include:  1) seed funding of academic industrial
              collaborations through Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
              (GOALI) program; 2) a teaching post-doctoral mentoring/professional
              development; 3) minigrants to defer cost of core "fee for service"
              instrumentation for early career faculty and small science and technology based
              businesses; 4) graduate student support for early career faculty and for
              encouragement of cross department/college projects; 5) research equipment
              acquisition for the multi-user research instrumentation; and 6) supplements to
              new faculty start-up funds for selected focus area faculty.  In addition, three
              major initiatives will address both economic and human resource development
              across the state.  These include: 1) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase-0 grants to provide seed funds for proof of concept or preliminary data
              collection; 2) awards for undergraduate research participation at undergraduate
              institutions; 3) high school outreach to both introduce a large number students
              to science and engineering careers and to involve a select group in summer
              research activities.
