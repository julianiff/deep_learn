Abstract    :

Steroid and peptide hormones are well known to
              modify behavior in  a wide variety of animals, including humans.  The objective
              of this research project is to understand how hormones act on individual cells
              to modify their properties, and how these cellular changes lead to alterations
              in behavior.  This study will exploit a simple model system to describe the
              specific effects of steroid and peptide hormones on identified neurons and
              muscles, and will correlate these biochemical and physiological modifications
              of cellular properties with the initiation of behavior.

To elucidate three
              aspects of hormone responsiveness.  Dr.  Novicki will use physiological and
              biochemical technques to:  identify the peptide hormone-induced physiological
              changes in neurons and muscles relevant to a change in behavior;  investigate
              how steroid and peptide hormones interact to assure that behavior occurs at the
              appropriate time; and examine the peptide-induced biochemical events that
              underlie the initiation of behavior.

An understanding of the
              hormonally-induced physiological and biochemical modifications within this
              relatively simple set of individual identified neurons and muscles will provide
              a foundation for understanding the cellular and molecular events fundamental to
              the hormonal modification of behavior.
