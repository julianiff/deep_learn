Abstract    :
              The Kansas Science and Technology Advanced Research Program (K*STAR) enhances
              research competitiveness at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University
              and Wichita State University.  K*STAR programs:  link faculty members of these
              universities in cooperative research projects; provide shared major equipment
              resources; fund junior faculty early on to increase their competitiveness for
              federal grants; and stimulates formation of research partnerships among the
              university, state and private sectors.  Included are:  a New Faculty Hires
              component to plug gaps in the institutions' research staffing;
              Acquisition/Upgrading of Multi-user Instrumentation to allow all researchers
              increase the scope of research that can be conducted; and First Award grants to
              help early-career faculty become more competitive for extramural research
              funding.  Special Initiative Grants are one-time, opportunistic investments
              that include:  (a) assistance to foster nationally competitive,
              high-performance computing and networking capabilities; (b) partnerships
              between EPSCoR researchers and the private sector to effect technology
              transfer; (c) innovative programs in graduate education and human resource
              development that expand student career options and facilitate the entry of
              members of underrepresented groups into high-demand S&T fields; and (d)
              short-term visits to establish cooperative research links to industrial and/or
              national laboratories.  Planning Grants, meanwhile, allow faculty to develop
              innovative research proposals focused in areas designated as state and
              institutional R&D priorities.
