Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research on compounds containing metal-metal multiple bonds by Dr.
              Malcolm H. Chisholm of the Chemistry Department, Indiana University.  Five
              areas of investigation will be carried out:  (1) synthesis of new dinuclear
              compounds and their elaboration in synthesis of homonuclear and heterometallic
              cluster compounds; (2) elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of substitution
              reactions of these compounds in order to establish general trends; (3)
              exploration of mechanisms and utility of multiredox reactions between C-X
              multiple bonds and M-M multiple bonds; (4) synthesis of covalently linked
              dimers of dinuclear complexes and the study of their physicochemical properties
              together with small oligomers as models for higher oligomers and polymers; and
              (5) the preparation and investigation of the properties of M-M multiple bonds
              in ordered assemblies (such as 1-D polymers, liquid crystalline phases and
              single crystals) with respect to their anisotropic properties of electron
              transfer and non-linear optical responses.

Metal arrays as clusters and
              chains have useful electronic, magnetic, and optical properties and are also
              important in catalysis.  This fundamental investigation will explore the
              synthesis of new arrays and their properties in a systematic way.  Students
              will have opportunities to learn a broad range of synthetic and physical
              methods and to extend their studies into materials research.
