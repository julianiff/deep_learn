Abstract    :
                 Insects that feed on flowers are particularly dependent on vision.  Most
              visual research on insects has been done on species active during the day, or
              diurnal.  We know little about the visual adaptations in nocturnal insects like
              moths that allow them to maneuver through a complex environment such as
              tropical forest, and find flowers in near darkness.  Visually-guided behaviors
              such as nectar feeding from flowers are driven by specific color-sensitive
              sensory cells and specialized subdivisions of the retina of their large
              compound eyes.  This project uses biochemistry and molecular biology to
              characterize and localize the light-sensitive proteins (rhodopsins) for color
              vision in the eye of the hawkmoth Manduca.  Behavioral and anatomical work on
              other hawkmoth species which have day-feeding and non-feeding adults are
              compared to the night-feeding species.  Results will highlight the particular
              adaptations for visual feeding at night, and be compared with the large
              knowledge base about flower visitation by bees and butterflies.
    This
              project has ecological significance because a substantial proportion of
              tropical plant pollination depends on hawkmoths, and it also is important for
              evolutionary biology, as well as visual neurobiology.
