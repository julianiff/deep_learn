Abstract    :
              The proposed study will 1)assess the extent to which USI projects have been able
              to effect the system of NSF drivers and whether causal relationships among the
              drivers can be identified in measurable terms, 2) examine impacts of
              curriuculum reform in elementary and secondary schools, and 3) investigate the
              interdependet roles of leadership, local resources, policies at all levels, and
              stakeholders involvement in efforts to improve student achievement in
              mathematics and science.  Four USI cities (Chicago, Miami, Memphis, and El Paso
              will be compared, both district-wide and in a sample of early and late cohort
              elementary and secondary schools.  The research design proposed is a multiple
              method strategy consisting of three investigations:
1) Mathematics and Science
              Attainment study -- developing a structural equation model of the hypothesized
              causal relationship among the latent varibles (Drivers)
2) Study of the
              Enacted Mathematics and Science Curriuculum -- using the Measures of
              constructivist curricula have been implemented
3) Policy Study - conducting a
              policy analysis that will examine coordination and alignment in state and
              national educationalpolicies affecting districts and schools.
