Abstract    :
              This  CAREER award supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, by
              Professor Vincent Remcho of Oregon State University is the development of
              molecular imprint polymer technology with microscale liquid phase separation
              techniques to be used as a new analytical tool in the screening of complex
              mixtures of biologically active molecules for specific activity.  Molecular
              recognition will be used in both covalent and noncovalent formats for the
              development of new stationary phase materials.  Tricyclic antidepressant
              compounds will be the target compounds for imprinting specificity.  The work
              will progress to novel specifc methods for the detection of PPAR mimics. 
              Bioanalytical course curricular reform forms the focus of the educational
              component of this CAREER proposal.

The premise of molecular imprinting is
              that a memory of a molecule's shape and size can be created in a three
              dimensional structure.  Once that memory is established, it becomes a selective
              tool, much as a key fits into a lock.  In the case of Professor Remcho's work,
              the selectivity gained through molecular imprinting is used to advantage in
              separations of targeted compounds from a complex mixture.
