Genetic changes between closely related species or races
              remain poorly understood; for example, we still do not know whether the
              biological differences between human and chimpanzee can be attributed to 100 or
              1,000,000 bases of our DNAs.  An ideal system for the analysis is one that i)
              are amenable to extensive genetic analysis; ii) show strong biological
              differences; and iii) are at an incipient stage of speciation.  The observed
              sexual isolation in Drosophila melanogaster is a promising system in these
              respects (Wu et al. 1995).  Females of this species from Zimbabwe do not mate
              with males from the cosmopolitan collections.  This is a widespread phenomenon
              in southern Africa (Hollocher et al. 1997a) and the sexual behaviors are robust
              with each autosome exerting strong influences (Hollocher et al. 1997b).  The
              project proposed by the PI will include genetic, behavioral and biochemical
              analyses.  

	In studying speciation by sexual selection, it has been very
              difficult to connect the behavioral evolution with genotypic changes.  This
              proposal presents a system and an experimental approach that make such a
              connection possible.  The long term goal is to understand the genetic,
              molecular and behavioral mechanisms of species and racial differentiation.
