Abstract    :
              An important issue to neurobiologists is whether neurons of the adult central
              nervous system (CNS) are capable of regenerating or regrowing into functional
              nervous tissue.  These capabilities are critical for efforts to repair the CNS.
               Studies of some birds have revealed that steroid hormones can have significant
              effects on the brain, including playing a role in neuronal restructuring
              (plasticity) in adults.  While there is limited evidence for plasticity in the
              mammalian spinal cord, nothing is known about steroid actions, including
              effects on neural plasticity, in the avian spinal cord.  Dr. Schlinger has
              identified an avian model (the Golden-collared manakin of Panama) that appears
              to have a steroid-sensitive neuromuscular system centered in the spinal cord. 
              In pilot studies, he found that many neurons in the male manakin spinal cord
              accumulate androgens and also identified one wing muscle that is sexually
              dimorphic in size.  These observations suggest that androgens may act on both
              the spinal cord and musculature of these birds.  Dr. Schlinger proposes to
              determine the full extent of the steroid sensitivity and sexual dimorphism of
              neural and muscular structures of these birds and evaluate whether androgens
              influence their growth and function.  These studies will advance the
              understanding about steroid control of complex behaviors, including spinal cord
              sexual differentiation and neural plasticity.
