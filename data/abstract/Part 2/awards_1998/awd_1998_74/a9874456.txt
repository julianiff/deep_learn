Abstract    :
              Orthologs of the mammalian genes encoding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR-1)
              and its dimerization partner, aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (AHA-1)
              were detected in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The function of these
              genes in normal development is unknown but the presence of the orthologs in C.
              elegans will allow a genetic approach to understanding the normal function of
              these genes.  The specific aims of this research are: 1) To determine the
              cellular and subcellular location of AHR-1 and AHA-1, the proteins encoded by
              the orthologus genes 2) Isolation and analysis of mutants defective in ahr-1 or
              aha-1 function 3) Test the hypothesis that endogenous ligands regulate nuclear
              translocation of AHR-1 during normal development. In a complementary approach,
              nuclear translocation of FG'P-tagged AHR-1 will be monitored in vivo. 4) Test
              the hypothesis that nuclear  localization of AHR-1 is dependent upon its
              dimerization partner AHA-1. The subcellular location of AHR-1 will be examined
              in existing mutants that lack aha-1 function. 

Although the normal function
              for these genes is unknown in either the mammalian or nematode systems, it is
              known that the mammalian receptor encoded by AHR-1 is a ligand-inducible
              transcription factor that can be inappropriately activated by environmental
              pollutants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin leading to carcinogenic,
              teratogenic, hepatotoxic and immunotoxic effects. The information resulting
              from these experiments will provide insight into the function of these genes in
              normal development as well as the causes for the inappropriate activation by
              environmental pollutants. Such information will become increasingly critical as
              the pollutant load in the atmosphere increases.
