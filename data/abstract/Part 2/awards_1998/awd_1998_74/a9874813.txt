Abstract    :
              Professor Sureshkumar and his students will address the core elements that are
              required to design and control polymer processing operations; namely, they will
              develop reliable models and robust simulation tools to predict the stability
              properties of non-isothermal viscoelastic flows.  Their experiments will employ
              digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) as well as infrared imaging
              techniques.  Professor Sureshkumar has also identified a comprehensive plan to
              provide educational experiences for students in K-12 through graduate study. 
              He will emphasize, in these experiences, the importance of these viscoelastic
              flows and the efficacy of the analytical/experimental techniques that are
              utilized in his research.
