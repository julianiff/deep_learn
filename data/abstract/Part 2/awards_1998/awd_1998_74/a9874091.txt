Abstract    :
              Craig Martens is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to study the theory and computer simulation of condensed
              phase dynamics on the femtosecond timescale.   The research focuses on two
              objectives: 1) the development of generalized classical molecular dynamics
              simulations for systems undergoing nonadiabatic transitions based on a
              semiclassical limit of the quantum mechanical Liouville equation; and 2) the
              study of nonequilibrium nonlinear dynamics of highly perturbed bath degrees of
              freedom in model condensed phase chemical and photophysical processes.  The
              techniques will be applied to the photodissociation of iodine in an Argon
              matrix, and will be compared with experimental data where possible.

A number
              of new experimental probes are being developed make it possible to study
              individual molecules in complex environments.  These ultrafast techniques
              enable chemists to examine chemical reactions on time and length scales that
              are unprecedented.  These probes have shed new light on the effects that
              solvation has on a chemical reaction which could have long term technological
              benefits.  Martens' research attempts to theoretically model these fundamental
              condensed phase dynamical processes.
