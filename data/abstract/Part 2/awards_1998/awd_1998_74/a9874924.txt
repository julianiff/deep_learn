  The Upham Brook watershed is an urban watershed
              that lies at the interface of a declining inner city and growth-oriented county
              with aging suburbs.  The last five miles of the brook before it joins with the
              Chickahominy River has been identified as so dangerously polluted that it
              threatens the heath of the residents who live, in the watershed and those who
              drink water that runs through it.  This watershed's condition, and the
              residents' response to this condition, raises questions that are fundamental to
              biological sciences and social sciences - questions concerning the biological
              processes that sustain and diminish plant and animal life., the social
              processes that promote the growth of a community and its decline, the
              psychological mechanisms that sustain health-threatening behaviors, and the
              institutional barriers put in place by be political system.  The proposed
              research will integrate the fields of urban planning, social psychology, -urban
              politics, urban design, biology and decision-modeling in a multi-disciplinary
              research effort to examine these fundamental questions, and in go timing,
              provide decision-makers, land use planners, and citizens with a science-based
              multiobjective decision analysis model.
