Abstract    :
              The Research Objectives of this Award are to: (1) use a combination of
              mathematical models and cellular engineering strategies to engineer the protein
              secretion machinery in bacterial cells for enhanced secretion of a recombinant
              protein product; and (2) establish a culture of integrated teams of graduate
              and undergraduate research assistants to execute experiments.  Members of these
              teams are to develop dialogues with researchers from other disciplines and
              different locations as appropriate.  The Teaching Objectives of the Award are
              to:  (1) establish and provide an infrastructure wherein undergraduate
              engineering students are exposed to and trained in a range of engineering
              skills including research techniques, communication of 
results, and practical
              problem solving with a particular emphasis on cultivating and preparing
              students for research careers; and (2) provide an infrastructure wherein
              graduate-level engineering 
students are trained in multidisciplinary
              approaches to interdisciplinary problems with an emphasis placed on studying
              practical problems encountered in industry while reinforcing the research
              skills necessary to complete a dissertation.
