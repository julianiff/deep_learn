Abstract    :
              This project of Professor Z. Rosenzweig of the University of New Orleans,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program,  is a study of a new
              fluorescence based analytical method for determination of pH, and the levels of
              molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in single living cells.  The new method
              is less invasive and more rapid than methods such as fluorescence microscopy or
              cell cytometry, and is proposed to be less technically involved for the user. 
              The measurements are indicative of exposure of the cell to oxidizing agents
              that are shown to be detrimental to the cell via formation of reactive oxygen
              species within the cell.  The measurement is made by monitoring the fluorescent
              emission of nanolipobeads that are incorporated in the cell membranes.  The
              educational aspects of the CAREER program are addressed via proposed revisions
              to the laboratory portion of the freshman chemistry laboratory and the
              incorporation of clinical chemistry experiments into an analytical chemistry
              graduate course.

Individual cells are considered to be accurate and
              sensitive indicators of biological stress induced by environmental pollutants. 
              The project of Professor Rosenzweig develops very small fluorescent beads that
              are incorporated into the cell membrane and provide a response that is an
              indicator of levels of reactive oxygen species inside the cell that are
              produced as a result of stress.
