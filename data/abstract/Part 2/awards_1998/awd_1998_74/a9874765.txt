This research program will accomplish the design and
              synthesis of structurally modified metal quinolate materials and carry out
              systematic studies correlating geometric, substituent, and metal ion effects on
              photoluminescent efficiencies, charge transport properties, and
              electroluminescent efficiencies.  Furthermore, detailed x-ray studies are
              planned to elucidate the electronic and molecular structure of these materials
              in thin films and at device interfaces.  A major goal will be to implement
              strong interdisciplinary collaborations between the departments of Chemistry,
              Physics, and Engineering.  This research program offers a unique opportunity
              for undergraduate and graduate student researchers in all three departments
              because of its  interdisciplinary nature.  For example students will work
              together to accomplish the design, synthesis and characterization of new
              materials as well as the fabrication and testing of devices.  The main
              educational objective is to recruit and better prepare undergraduates for
              research endeavors at an earlier stage in their academic career.  This will be
              accomplished through proposed course curriculum enhancements in the Organic
              Chemistry Program and the development of interdepartmental courses in Advanced
              Topics of Materials.

The design, synthesis and characterization of
              organic materials exhibiting electroluminescence is highly relevant to
              important technologies that include various full-color, flat-panel display
              applications.  A fuller understanding of the electronic and molecular structure
              of organic materials and methods for controlling their optical properties in
              thin films and at device interfaces is needed to advance the development of
              various device applications areas.
