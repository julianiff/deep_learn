Scientists have been interested in how animals stand
              upright, walk and run for many years. Sensory receptors associated with muscles
              are important in controlling these behaviors, but just how they do this is
              still not understood. One way of answering questions about this sensory control
              is to turn to animals with many fewer neurons in their nervous systems -
              invertebrates such as crabs, insects or snails - to analyze the neuronal
              mechanisms of this control. Hermit crabs live in and carry as protection
              cast-off snail shells. Their abdomens curl around and grasp the inner column of
              the shell; the muscles that lift the abdomen are controlled by a small number
              of identifiable motoneurons. These motoneurons are excited by sensory receptors
              signaling the force generated by the muscles. This positive feedback control is
              unusual, but positive feedback control is found in mammalian nervous systems as
              well. Thus, the hermit crab may be a useful model for understanding the general
              role of positive feedback in motor systems. Although a mathematical system
              model of this control has been developed, certain critical features have not
              been studied. This project will examine the signal processing performed by the
              sensory receptors and how their signals excite and inhibit interneurons and
              motoneurons that are involved in this control. Pharmacology is a useful tool
              for manipulating neuronal excitability; this project will support studies to
              identify molecules important in the hermit crab shell support behavior. These
              compounds can then be used to change the amount of feedback to determine why
              positive feedback in this system is beneficial and does not damage the abdomen.
              Simulation of the system will be used to study the critical features of this
              control and to compare its organization with mammalian postural systems.
