Abstract    :
              The research emphases of this program are understanding of the fundamental
              reaction mechanism of aromatics combustion under variable pressures, developing
              detailed kinetic models of benzene combustion at high pressures, and developing
              new and robust approaches to kinetic models.  The studies consist of  quantum-
              mechanical calculations to estimate thermochemical properties of intermediate
              species in aromatics oxidation and to study potential-energy surfaces and
              reaction pathways involved in one-ring aromatics oxidation;
              Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) calculations to analyze reaction pathways
              and estimate the temperature and pressure dependence of unimolecular and
              chemically activated reactions relevant to benzene oxidation; detailed kinetic
              modeling studies; and systematic optimization of a kinetic model using solution
              mapping techniques.

The education program is an integral part of an
              institution-wide reform of undergraduate education and includes introducing
              small, well-formulated research and design projects into a junior-year thermo-
              dynamics course that cover topics in HVAC and combustion; experimenting with a
              new curriculum that introduces selected chemistry topics in an effective manner
              to mechanical-engineering students whose interest are cross-disciplinary,
              including emerging areas such as pollution prevention, biomechanics, and
              materials; and reaching out to local-area, including inner-city, school
              children.
