Abstract    :
              





Seasonal reproduction in vertebrates is often characterized by
              specific increases in gonadal activity that is regulated by changes in steroid
              hormone production.  These changes are often under control of the environment. 
              However, the exact molecular mechanism that initiates the cascade of hormonal
              events set off by the changing environment is unknown.  Steroidogenic Factor 1
              (SF-1) is a protein that plays a vital role in inducing reproductively in
              appropriate hormone and receptor synthesis in several tissues.  Dr. Propper and
              her associates propose that SF-1 may play a fundamental role in mediating
              environmentally regulated seasonal reproduction.  In order to begin studies on
              the role of SF-1 in seasonal reproduction, she proposes to determine the amino
              acid sequence of SF-1 in an amphibian whose pattern of seasonal reproduction
              has been well-defined (American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana).  She will also
              determine the tissue and cell distribution of SF-1 in this species.
