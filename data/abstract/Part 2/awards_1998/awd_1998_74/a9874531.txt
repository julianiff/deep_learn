Abstract    :
              Because plants are immobile, they adapt to their environment by alteration of
              their development and physiology.  Since plants are photosynthetic, light is a
              critical factor that influences nearly every aspect of plant development,
              including seed germination, plant structure, and the timing of flowering.  The
              genetic mechanisms that underlie plant developmental responses to the light are
              poorly defined.  We have isolated a set of arabidopsis mutants that have
              exaggerated developmental responses to red, far-red and blue light.  These
              mutants may be defective in elements of the light signal transduction pathway. 
              Genetic mapping will be used to define the location of two of these mutations
              in the arabidopsis genome, and this information will be used to clone and
              characterize the corresponding wild-type genes.  Detailed genetic, molecular
              and biochemical analysis will be carried out in order to identify the specific
              functions of the cloned genes, and to determine the roles they play in light
              signaling.  This work is significant in that it will provide insights into the
              genetic and molecular mechanisms plants use to modulate their development in
              response to the environment.
