Glycosylation of proteins represents the most complex
              post-translational modification of proteins known to occur. It is becoming
              increasingly accepted that the oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins have
              an important role in protein stability, function and turnover, and one of the
              moieties shown to have an influence on these roles is fucose. A large number of
              studies have reported that glycoprotein metabolism in general is altered in
              cancer and other diseases.  Understanding fucose metabolism in greater depth
              may allow manipulation of the fucosylation state of proteins, thereby
              manipulating protein half-lives.  The research objectives of the proposal are:
              
1.   to characterize fucosylated proteins secreted by rat hepatoma cells, in
              terms of protein properties  and glycosylation patterns, under different
              inductive conditions; 
2.  to examine the effect of fucosylation on protein
              turnover, a. in terms of receptor-mediated endocytosis; and b. in terms of
              degradation, both in vitro and in vivo.
As part of the CAREER grant, the P.I.
              will redesign several courses in biochemistry, including developing online
              biochemistry materials; and will develop his research program as a series of
              experiments to be carried out by undergraduates, and by a high school student
              and teacher.
