Abstract    :
              The proposed project consists of a series of studies to investigate the outputs,
              outcomes, and impacts of statewide systemic initiatives on student learning,
              curriculum, and policy.  The first study will analyze mathematics NAEP data at
              three grade levels for three years (1990, 1992, and 1996).  The percent of
              students at or above mathematics proficiency will be compared for 22 SSI states
              and 17 non-SSI states.  In a second study, existing state assessment data in
              mathematics and science for targeted states will be studied for total score and
              scale scores over the time period of 1990 through 1999.  The third study will
              analyze the relationship among change in student outcomes, process indicators,
              and systemic reform attributes with the level that districts/schools within a
              state have engaged in a SSI.  Additionally, existing information on systemic
              reform will be mined and summarized through a series of small focus conferences
              of expert consultants.  New research findings from the studies described above
              will be used to refine the information and generate new interpretations.
