Title:  "Neighborhood interactions and territory size in the
              fire ant"


For many animals, the defense of foraging territories serves as
              an
important mechanism of population regulation.  Models of territory size
              can
help to understand the population ecology of these species by
              predicting
how the partitioning of territories changes in response to
              variation in
food supply or competitive environment.  A recent model predicts
              territory
sizes and shapes for contiguous neighbors as a result of
              competitive
interactions at territory boundaries.  This research tests and
              extends this
model through a series of field experiments on colonies of the
              fire ant
Solenopsis invicta.  Methods will include manipulations of colony
              sizes and
competitive neighborhoods, controlled supplements of food density in
              local
patches and across pairs of territories, standardized measurements
              of
aggression, and game theoretical models of territory interactions.

This
              work will develop a general approach to the study of territoriality,
and other
              interactions, for which the spatial outcome of one individual's
actions depend
              on the decisions and reactions of multiple neighbors.  This
approach can be
              applied to a wide variety of habitats and animals,
including both vertebrates
              and invertebrates.  A specific model will be
developed and tested for the fire
              ant.  This information will be used to
improve prediction of population
              dynamics for this important insect pest.
