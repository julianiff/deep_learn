Abstract    :
              Professor Meinhart will extend his pioneering work on extremely small scale
              particle image velocimetry (PIV) to study flows in micro flow systems. 
              Effective fluid mixing at these very small scales is a qualitatively different
              phenomenon than the familiar macroscopic scale mixing.  The ability to record
              the associated velocity fields in microscale mixing will be of considerable
              importance for the development of micro-bioanalytical instruments and other
              devices which will depend upon "chaotic advection".

Professor Meinhart will
              coordinate his research with his instructional contributions.  These will
              include his involvement with the University of California - Santa Barbara
              Educational Outreach Program in which he will bring the interesting aspects of
              Micro Electrical-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to persons in the K-12 through
              graduate school programs.
