Abstract    :
              This project by Professor Dan Scherson of Case Western Reserve University in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program is designed to gain insight into the
              mechanisms of redox reactions involving nitrogen and sulfur oxides and
              oxyanions in aqueous electrolytes.  Irreversibly adsorbed catalysts for these
              reactions will be studied in situ by use of different surface spectroscopies. 
              The microtopography of clean and surface modified metal crystal surfaces will
              also be studied with these same spectroscopic methods.  Identification of the
              reactive intermediates will provide insight into the mechanisms of these
              reactions.  The study is of fundamental importance in the design of new
              electrocatalysts, and in the design of specific sensors for species such as
              nitric oxide, which has been shown to have wide-ranging biological
              activity.

Oxidation and reduction reactions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides on
              electrode surfaces is important in catalysis as well as in biochemical systems,
              and it has been suspected that there are key intermediates in the reaction that
              are not yet identified.  Professor Scherson and his group at Case Western
              Reserve University will use surface spectroscopic methods to identify these
              intermediates and assess their catalytic importance.
