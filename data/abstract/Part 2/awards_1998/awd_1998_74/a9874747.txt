DLI-Phase 2: An Operational Social Science Digital Data Library

This
              proposal is for developing a Virtual Data Center (VDC) for managing and sharing
              numerical social science data for teaching and research purposes across
              multiple institutions. This project will refine and extendthe prototype data
              server developed by the Harvard-MIT Data Center and turn it into a free,
              portable software product that will integrate with other data centers and
              library databases by supporting a variety of communication and interoperation
              protocols.  The project is unique in serving as a public
resource offering an
              open set of tools, and as a way to test and adapt previous digital library
              research to the rigors of a production environment.  The project will be one of
              the first to address a number of digital library issues in a production
              environment, and will serve as a production framework for other types of
              digital libraries.
