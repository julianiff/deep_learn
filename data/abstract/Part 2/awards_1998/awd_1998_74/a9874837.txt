Abstract    :
              This plan is centered on industrial decision-making, natural resource
              development, and environmental protection.  The research component will compare
              four case studies of land-use/land-cover change within mineral exraction
              regions of the Americas. (Arizona US, Sonora Mexico, Orinoco Belt Venezuela,
              and southern Andes Peru) An analysis of the impact of mineral investment on
              land values, land-use, and land-cover over time will use data derived from
              interviews with local land users combined with information from local archival
              sources. This information will be used to construct a model of the
              socioeconomic mechnisms through which direct investment drives
              land-use/land-cover change.  Both direct land-cover change (at the site of the
              extraction activity) and indirect land-cover change (land values change and
              supporting infrastructural development) will be researched.

The educational
              component will result in the development of two interdisciplinary courses to be
              team-taught with colleagues from Business, Economics, and the Institute for
              Energy Economics and Policy, and a program of K-12 outreach in partnership with
              the Oklahoma Alliance for Geographic Education to develop curriculum materials
              which assist teachers in meeting the National Geography Standards.
