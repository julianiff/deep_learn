Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports research and education on structurally defined ligands by Dr.
              Michael Scott of the Chemistry Department, University of Florida.  A new class
              of tripodal aryloxide ligands with a preorganized bowl-like shape will be
              synthesized.  The ligands can be adjusted by chemical modification to
              selectively bind various metal ions or to alter their reactivity.   Some of the
              ligands are sufficiently rigid that they can be used in the assembly of
              supramolecular structures containing metal ions.   The ligands have three
              binding sites and so  binding of more than one metal center to the ligand
              backbone is possible, yet oligomerization is inhibited.  

Compounds
              containing aluminum will be prepared which will be useful as robust catalysts
              for alkylations, cycloadditions and many other chemical reactions. 
              Undergraduate students involved in the project will learn about molecular
              recognition and catalysis, in addition to skills in synthesis and
              characterization.  The educational component of this CAREER Award will focus on
              developing a course in inorganic biochemistry for biochemistry students and on
              offering an undergraduate research course in the department.
