Abstract    :
              	The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms cells use for
              normal DNA function and maintenance in meiosis.  All of the mechanisms cells
              use for this purpose are not known.  The primary objective of this project is
              to determine and understand functions of the BLM5 gene of Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae in maintaining normal eukaryotic DNA function in meiosis.  The blm
              mutants of S. cerevisiae were isolated on the basis of their hypersensitivity
              to killing by ionizing radiation, H2O2, and the bleomycin and phleomycin
              chemical families.  Meiosis is defective in heterozygous BLM5/blm5-1 and
              homozygous blm5-1/ blm5-1 mutant diploid cells.  Objectives of this project
              include determining 1) the role of the BLM5 gene in maintaining normal
              chromosomal structure and function in meiosis, 2) how the BLM5  gene functions
              with other genes in meiosis, 3) genes, gene products and functions that
              complement the blm5 mutation in meiosis, and 4) the relationship between
              chromosomal lesions in meiosis and viability.   
	The proposed research
              integrates interrelated studies at the cellular and molecular levels, using
              genetic characterizations, molecular biology and biochemistry. The genetic
              sophistication, molecular flexibility and availability of mutant strains of S.
              cerevisiae permit these studies and technical approaches.  Studies of the blm
              mutants will contribute important basic knowledge on normal DNA function and
              maintenance during meiosis.
