Abstract    :
              

The murine "dilute" unconventional myosin (Myo5a) locus provides an
              outstanding genetic system to study molecular motor-cargo interactions and
              overlapping functions of closely related members of unconventional myosin
              families.  Several aspects of the "dilute" system contribute to a powerful
              approach to answering these questions: the availability of multiple mutant
              alleles at the "dilute" locus and the "ashen," "leaden," and "dilute
              suppressor" loci; the recent characterization by Mercer of a second mammalian
              member of the "dilute" family, myr 6 (Myo5b); the ability to manipulate the
              genome of the mouse; and the availability of a primary melanocyte cell culture
              system that provides a visual assay for "dilute" myosin function. The  studies
              will impact the organelle transport field by providing insights into
              motor-cargo interactions and testing for functional redundancy within an
              unconventional myosin family.

The studies have the following
              objectives:

1, Determine the functions of "dilute" and identify proteins
              that interact with "dilute" in both primary melanocyte and melanoma cell lines,
              using cell biological, biochemical, and genetic methods.

2, Identify regions
              of the "dilute" myosin tail that confer cargo-binding specificity using
              chimeric cDNA constructs with portions of the "dilute" myosin (myosin-Va) and
              its close relative, myr 6 (myosin-Vb), in both cultured cells and in transgenic
              mice.
