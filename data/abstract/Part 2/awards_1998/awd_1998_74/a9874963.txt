Professor Miller's research seeks to apply and extend
              discoveries about how enzymes catalyze chemical reactions by synthesizing
              "minimal" enzyme-like catalysts.  This approach may provide insight into the
              specific elements required for effective asymmetric catalysis, and practical
              catalysts are sought for several applications.  These include synthetic
              acylases, aldolases and "Diels-Alderases," as well as catalysts for the
              Baylis-Hillman reaction.  Solid-state peptide synthesis will facilitate the
              preparation and screening of potential catalysts.  Professor Miller's teaching
              program has as its ultimate goal a "cradle to grave" program of scientific
              education.  More specifically, this will involve "outreach" to secondary
              schools, curricular reform of the sophomore organic chemistry course, a
              commitment to undergraduate participation in research, and the promotion of
              graduate students as teacher-scholars in training.

With this CAREER award,
              the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and teaching efforts of Dr.
              Scott J. Miller of Boston College.  Professor Miller creates small artificial
              enzymes that are capable of promoting several chemical reactions that are
              important in the synthesis of complex organic molecules.  It will also be
              important to better understand how these small pseudoenzymes work because this
              knowledge can then be passed along to the study of larger enzymes that work in
              living organisms.  Professor Miller's teaching stresses the ongoing, life-long
              nature of the scientific enterprise, and his teaching activities are aimed at
              promoting this view among high-school, college, and graduate
              students.
