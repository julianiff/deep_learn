DLI-PHASE 2: A Digital Library of Vertebrate Morphology, Using
              High-Resolution 
X-ray CT 

This is the first year funding of a three year
              continuing award.  This project is an intensive application of high-resolution
              X-ray Computed Tomography scanning (X-ray CT) to the study of the vertebrate
              skeleton.  The instruments are derived from of medical diagnostic CT scanners,
              and enable the non-destructive inspection of tiny 3-dimensional objects in
              extremely fine detail. This project is a collaboration among 24 researchers at
              leading research universities and natural history museums around the world. 
              The investigators will build a novel digital library of high-resolution X-ray
              CT images and 3-D models.  The library will enable more detailed and
              comprehensive analyses of vertebrate structure than previously possible and be
              accessible to  a globally networked audience of researchers, educators, and
              students.  The project will study the skeleton in all of its forms, from
              fossils to embryos and adults of living species.  The study will include broad
              taxonomic diversity of important laboratory and research species, and sample
              the smallest four orders of vertebrate size-magnitudes.
