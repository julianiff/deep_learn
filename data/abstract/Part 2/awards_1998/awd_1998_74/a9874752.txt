Abstract    :
              	This award was made under the NSF CAREER Program and is supported jointly by
              the Atmospheric Chemistry and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Programs.
              
	The research component of this project consists of experimental chemical
              kinetics measurements that address the role of the methyl peroxy radical
              (CH3O2) in tropospheric and stratospheric processes, with a focus on reactions
              which may affect ozone destruction and production cycles. A secondary objective
              is to further the development of the chemical ionization mass spectrometry
              (CIMS) technique as a promising new method for both laboratory and field
              detection of atmospheric species. The turbulent flow-CIMS method will be used
              to measure rates at temperature and pressure conditions characteristic of the
              troposphere and lower stratosphere. In addition, sensitive and selective
              chemical ionization schemes will be developed for measurements at low absolute
              concentrations and for unambiguous monitoring of reactants and products. 
	The
              primary objective of the education plan is to enhance the quality of Hope
              College's chemistry program through a systematic implementation of innovative
              teaching techniques and by introducing environmental chemistry topics in both
              the classroom and the undergraduate research setting. Collaborative learning
              techniques will be used, and research-related case studies will be incorporated
              into the teaching.
