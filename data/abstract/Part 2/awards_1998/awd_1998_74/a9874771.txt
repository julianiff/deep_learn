DLI Phase 2: Folk Literature of the Sephardic Jews: A
              Multi-tiered Extensible Digital Archive

The Armistead-Silverman collection
              at the University of California at Davis contains fifteen hundred
              "Judeo-Spanish" narrative ballads, together with other genres, including lyric
              poetry, folktales, proverbs, and riddles. The oral traditions preserved in the
              language also known as ``Ladino'' but called ``Judeo-Spanish'' in this grant
              proposal, were gathered by Professors Farmstead, Katz, and Silverman during the
              years 1957-1980 from
informants from Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece,
              Turkey, Morocco, Israel, Spain, and the United States. This material is the
              largest collection of Judeo-Spanish oral literature in North America, and one
              of the three largest in the world.  The Judeo-Spanish oral tradition preserves
              a cultural legacy for the study of Sephardic Jewry as well as for
researchers
              in the history of pan-Hispanic and pan-European balladry. This oral tradition,
              with roots extending back into Middle Ages, provides a unique matrix within
              which Hispanic written literature was created.

The technical goals of the
              project are to continue conversion of this material to a multi-media digital
              corpus so that these materials can be made ,more widely available, with
              increased access analytic capabilities.  Textual transcriptions will be tagged
              using a number of markup methods, especially XML and a digital audio database
              will be created.  A variety of approaches will be tested to make the archive
              fully extensible.  The
project will build on earlier research products from
              other digital libraries projects,
including the University California,
              Berkeley digital libraries group.
