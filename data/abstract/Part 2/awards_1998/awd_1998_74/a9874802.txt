Abstract    :
              EPSCoR will build science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) infrastructure in
              North Dakota that will 1) increase competitiveness for merit-based grants and
              contracts; 2) improve research productivity; 3) increase the rate and quality
              of technology transfer from university originated research to the private
              sector in North Dakota, and, 4) enhance the development of human resources in
              North Dakota.  A three pronged competitive grants program designed to improve
              research competitiveness and productivity will be conducted that includes:  1)
              a program in which Chairs and Deans compete for funds to improve their ability
              to hire top quality faculty, 2) peer-reviewed seed grants for new principal
              investigators, and, 3) a graduate student enhancement program designed to
              increase research productivity as well as the number of graduates from SEM
              areas.  The project will also conduct a multi-component human resources program
              designed to achieve the following goals:  1) increase the opportunities
              available for students of the North Dakota University System to participate in
              research; 2) increase the numbers of members of underrepresented groups
              involved in SEM research activities will be implemented.  Undergraduate
              research and mentoring programs for the summer months and academic year, which
              target underrepresented groups, will be continued and upgraded.  These include
              programs designed in consultation with North Dakota's Tribal Community Colleges
              and a new program targeting potential women scientists and another geared to
              facilitate the transition from high school science activities to undergraduate
              research programs.
