This project studies combinatorial and algebraic models
              of computation for Boolean functions. Such models are Boolean circuits and
              formulae, branching programs, span programs and models of communication
              complexity. The complexity of computational problems in these models
              corresponds to their inherent complexity in terms of important computational
              resources.

The main questions addressed in this research are: finding new
              methods for proving complexity lower bounds, the role of randomness and
              pseudorandomness in the complexity of Boolean functions, and issues of fault
              tolerance in the above models. The educational component of the project
              includes the development of an upper level undergraduate course on fault
              tolerance and error correcting codes, and development of a series of graduate
              research courses in complexity theory.
