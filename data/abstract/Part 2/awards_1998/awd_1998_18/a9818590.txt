Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to extend the University of Denver atlas of
              high-resolution (approx. 0.002 cm-1) infrared solar absorption stratospheric
              spectra and the corresponding laboratory and theoretical studies initiated
              under previous NSF grants. The currently published high-resolution
              stratospheric atlas covers several intervals between 800 and 2060 cm-1. For
              each interval, accurate line positions with molecular and atomic
              identifications are tabulated. 
	The major objectives of this research are: 1)
              to extend the 0.002 cm-1 resolution atlases over additional intervals in the
              2.5-30um region, mostly with solar and laboratory spectra already obtained, and
              new spectra anticipated to be obtained in 1999-2001; 2) to extend the
              spectroscopic analysis of specific stratospheric molecules, such as ozone,
              nitric acid, chlorine nitrate, carbonyl fluoride, nitrogen dioxide, molecular
              oxygen, and others, from the laboratory and the stratospheric spectra.
