Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for the 1999 Law and Society Association Summer
              Institute in Sociolegal Studies.  Approximately 25 new entrants to the field of
              law and society will participate in a four-day program with a faculty of
              distinguished scholars.  The Institute will provide an opportunity for junior
              faculty and advanced graduate students to interact with leading figures in
              sociolegal studies and build linkages between generations of law and social
              science scholars.  The theme for the 1999 Summer Institute is New Legal
              Landscapes: Rethinking the Legal Subject in Shifting Contexts.  The 1999
              Institute will examine the reconstitution of numerous subjects of legal control
              at transnational, regional, national and domestic levels.  The central
              questions to be explored are: How are new legal divisions being forged and old
              legal divisions being reinforced, and in what ways may this affect whom and
              what we consider the subjects of legal authority and restraint?  These
              questions will provide an organizing framework for discussion and exchange of
              theoretical and research methodologies among the Institute's participants.  The
              Institute will be organized so that invitees will have an opportunity to meet
              in small groups to (1) discuss the theoretical ideas in the presentations, and
              (2) work through specific research ideas and plans.  An explicit goal of the
              Institute is to provide the kind of small-group exchange, close mentoring, and
              continued association after the workshop that will enable participants to
              pursue sociolegal research more effectively.
