ABSTRACT: 
Current and future climate research programs
              are requiring increased accuracy of air-sea flux estimates.  Improved
              meteorological measurements and aerodynamic bulk formulae have brought net
              error in short-wave radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes down to
              approximately +/- 10 W/ m2. Conservative error estimates for long-wave
              radiation flux measurements are comparable to short-wave measurements at night,
              but during the day, they are about +/- 40 W/m2. Thus, downward long-wave
              irradiance is the source of the largest uncertainty in the air-sea surface
              energy budget.  The PI's propose to 1) design and fabricate a new pyrgeometer;
              2) demonstrate its improved characteristics; 3) collect accurate downwelling
              long-wave observations in conjunction with ongoing and planned field
              activities; and 4) encourage its use by the air-sea interaction community.
