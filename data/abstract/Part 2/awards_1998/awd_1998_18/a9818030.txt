Abstract    :
              The IEEE INFOCOM Conference Computer Communications will be held in New York,
              New York, during March 21-25,1999. This preeminent technical conference is the
              primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer
              communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the
              field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the
              development of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty
              members. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel
              and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing
              leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests funding to aid
              approximate twelve gradute students, post-docs, and junior faculty in the
              United States in attending this premiere conference.
