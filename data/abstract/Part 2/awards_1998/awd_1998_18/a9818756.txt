Abstract    :
              Random Utility 2000 (RU 2000) is a sequence of events with the common goal of
              assessing the current state and defining directions for future research in
              random utility theory and its applications.  The first event will consist of
              two days of tutorial sessions in which world-leading scholars will present the
              fundamentals of probabilistic choice modeling. The tutorials will be followed
              by the main event: a six day workshop and conference where establisted scholars
              and junior participants will jointly carve out a vision statement for random
              utility and probabilistic choice modeling in the new millenium.  All events
              will be held at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, in the summer
              2000.

The key objectives of the project are:

1) to bring together
              world-leading scholars from diverse backgrounds who work on topics that are
              relevant and related to probabilistic models of choice and measurement,  
              

2) to offer a unique opportunity for young, promising scholars to interact
              with each other and with senior scholars and familiarize themselves with the
              state of the art in random utility theory and probabilistic measurement theory,
              

3) to provide a forum for brain-storming over the key open problems and
              issues, with the goal of collectively generating a programmatic list of the
              most important unresolved questions and most promising avenues of research.
