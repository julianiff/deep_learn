The
              researchers will conduct a hydrological field and modeling program to better
              understand how hydrology and vegetation interact in the Arctic.  Meteorological
              and soil active layer data will be collected at sites in northwestern Alaska
              where tundra ecological studies are underway.  The coordinated project is
              examining the role of climate change on tundra ecology that could occur in
              response to global warming.  Radar imagery and field data will be collected and
              used in hydrologic and climate models that are used to project future
              environmental conditions on the Alaska North Slope under warmer climate
              conditions.  This hydrological study is critical to understanding the role of
              precipitation, run-off, and soil moisture on the sustainability of tundra
              regions throughout the Arctic where global climate models predict the greatest
              effects from global warming.
