Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides for partial
              support for an OC-3c connection to the very high performance Backbone Network
              Service (vBNS) for the University of Georgia Research Foundation for two years.
              Applications involve distributed databases, remote astronomy, teleconferencing,
              distance learning, remote visualization, instrumentation, and image processing;
              telecollaboration in areas such as plant genomics research, molecular biology
              and whole plant physiology. Collaborating institutions include the U.S.
              Geological Survey, National Mapping Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Yale
              University, NASA, University of Houston, University of Illinois NCSA, Texas A&M
              and George Mason University.
