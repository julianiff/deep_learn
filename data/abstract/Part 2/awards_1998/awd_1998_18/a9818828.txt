"Learning by Design" is a series of modules for middle
              school science that engages students in the study of life, earth and physical
              science for a few weeks.  The curriculum builds upon previously funded modules
              in physical science.  Informed by cognitive science research, complex realistic
              engineering design challenges, collaborative learning and student reflection
              are used to promote deep learning of essential concepts and critical thinking
              skills through hands-on problem solving.  Students attempt a rough solution to
              a design challenge.  Through class discussion, "gallery walks" and "pin-ups",
              students compare and contrast solutions. Students then engage in cycles of
              experimentation, evaluation, and revision of the design.  The earth science
              challenges include beach erosion and tunneling.  The life science challenge is
              to prepare for a long hike.  Challenges that integrate sciences are consumer
              science and product design.  Assessments are designed to measure student
              achievement on standard measures and to measure student growth on concept and
              skill development.  Dissemination is by commercial publisher and presentation
              of research on how teachers can use design to facilitate students learning of
              concepts.
