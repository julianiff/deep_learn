Abstract    :
              This award will support travel of US scientists to participate in the Symposium
              on Experimental Gravitation, to be held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, August 16-21,
              1999.  The Symposium will describe progress over the past few years, and allow
              participants to exchange ideas and suggestions for future research.  The
              location of the conference will provide a special opportunity to begin new
              international collaborations with a talented pool of scientists.
