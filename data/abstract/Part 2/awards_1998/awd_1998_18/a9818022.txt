              AWARD ABSTRACT - 9818022

This award will support the establishment of a
              multi-user two-photon excitation microscope facility in the Department of
              Cellular and Structural Biology at the University of Texas Health Science
              Center in San Antonio.  The award will support the purchase of a Zeiss LSM 410
              laser-scanning confocal microscope modified for non-descanned detection, and a
              Coherent Verdi 5 watt diode pumped solid state laser coupled to a Mira-900-F
              Femtosecond Modelocked Ti:Sapphire laser as the excitation source.  The
              Ti:Sapphire laser will contain Coherent's new X-wave optic set, allowing the
              tuning of excitation wavelengths from 680-1000 nm without the need to change
              laser optics.  This provides two-photon excitation from 340-500 nm, allowing
              most UV-and visible-wavelength absorbing dyes to be excited.  Applications for
              this instrument include 1) Monitoring mitochondrial Ca2+ and pH during
              apoptosis without exciting nearby slices (such as in the overlying or
              underlying mitochondria).  2) Monitoring temporal and spatial interactions
              between apopototic regulatory proteins in single intact living cells using
              two-fusion FRET.  3) Identifying the critical residues of calreticulin which
              mediate inhibition of pulsatile Ca2+ release from the ER.  4) Examining the
              molecular control of Ca2+ signaling by Ca2+ binding proteins, Ca2+-ATPases, and
              mitochondria.  5) Evaluating genotypic abnormalities of precursors and stem
              cells in archived breast cancer samples at the level of RNA and protein.  6)
              Dissection of protein-protein interactions that underlie the endocytic part of
              the neurotransmission process.  7) Photoreceptor cell patterning.  And 8)
              Simultaneous localization of different cells and
              cytokines/addressins/chemokines in thick sections of the CNS.
