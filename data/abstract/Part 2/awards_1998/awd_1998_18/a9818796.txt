Abstract    :
              This project builds on prior research on Latin American and examines the
              interaction between transnational developments and the role of law and lawyers
              in four Asian countries (India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Taiwan).  Using a
              structural approach, the project seeks to understand the ways in which
              international strategies, especially in the past two to three decades, are
              transforming the landscapes of power and prestige and the rules of the game for
              the state and economy.  Debt crises, foreign investment, human rights
              movements, and the more general development of an international market in
              professional expertise can be expected to lead to important change sin Asia and
              in the particular countries that will be studies.  Preliminary research and an
              examination  of the available literature provides a picture of the different
              starting points in these countries and the competing forms of authority and
              expertise that are prominent in the region.  Data will be collected through
              extensive interviewing and will be used to situate law in relation to various
              competitors, and to help gain an understanding of the institutional patterns
              that are emerging or have emerged.  The project seeks: (1) to explore
              transnational processes of change in governance-in the "state" as defined
              broadly-that have been important in may different countries, (2) to relate the
              intensity and impact of those processes to a number of regional and national
              settings, and (3) to highlight the changing position and role of lawyers in
              these various settings.
