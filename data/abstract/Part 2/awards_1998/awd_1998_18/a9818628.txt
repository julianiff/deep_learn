Title:
              Vortex Interactions with Abrupt Topography

The proposed research will
              address the interaction of eddies and vortices with abrupt topographic
              features. The issues to be dealt are (1) the interaction of a seamount chain
              and meddies, (2) the interaction of a mean flow and a seamount chain, and (3)
              vortex and ring interaction with continental shelves and slopes. The principal
              tools will be analytical and numerical process models. The work is important
              because the result of the studies will impact areas such as the formation and
              maintenance of the Mediterranean salt tongue and the penetration of energy from
              the open ocean onto the shelf.
