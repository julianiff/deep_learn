              ABSTRACT

OCE-9818804


With the aim of bringing a high-quality
              observations on a continental shelf setting into the final synthesis of the
              U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS), a team of researchers from
              seven major oceanographic institutions and university marine science
              departments will endeavor to organize and synthesize data on the cycling of
              carbon and related biologically-active elements collected during a unique field
              experiment on the Chesapeake-Hatteras continental shelf region of the Atlantic
              Ocean.  The data include synoptic measurements of the standing amounts, fluxes,
              and physical transport of inorganic and organic carbon together with the
              associated  biological community dynamics.  These data will first be organized
              and studied to understand the biogeochemical dynamics of the shelf system
              itself and then worked into the greater ocean carbon modeling effort of the
              U.S.JGOFS Synthesis and Modeling Project.  The researchers anticipate that the
              results will provide a first look at the role and quantitative significance of
              continental shelf processes in the overall global carbon cycle.
