The objective of this research is to clarify the
              mechanisms responsible for a variety of physical properties exhibited by
              transition-metal oxides.  Examples include complex electronic transitions of
              perovskite type oxides correlated with their magnetic properties.  At the
              present time, solid state theory is unable to account for such properties as
              the high-temperature superconductivity of the copper oxides or the colossal
              intrinsic magnetoresistance of the manganese-oxide perovskites.  These studies
              will aim to fill a gap in our understanding essential for theoretical
              development needed for the design of new classes of materials.

Because
              they exhibit properties such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal
              magnetoresistance, and thermoelectric behavior, transition metal oxides
              constitute one of the most important and interesting classes of materials with
              respect to their potential for technological applications.  Studying the
              relation of chemistry and crystal structure to the physical properties of these
              solids will aid the development of theory important to the design of a new and
              improved engineering materials.
