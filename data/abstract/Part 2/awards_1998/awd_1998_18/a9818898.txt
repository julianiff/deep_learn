Abstract    :
              This project will examine the origins, scope, and consequences of felon
              disenfranchisement in the United States. Our preliminary estimates suggest that
              4.6 million voters were disenfranchised in 1996 due to their criminal status,
              up from less than 500,000 as recently as 1972. The project has three general
              objectives: (1) Estimate the size of the disenfranchised felon population and
              model the trends in the size of this group into the future. (2) Assess some of
              the electoral consequences of disenfranchisement, given that the felon
              population is drawn disproportionately from the ranks of racial minorities and
              the poor, and hence is more likely to take votes from Democratic than
              Republican candidates. (3) Examine the sources of the differences among the
              states in the treatment of felon voting rights. Methodolgies will include
              computer simulations, analyses of data from the National Election Study, and
              state-level turnout information from the Current Population Survey Voting
              Supplement surveys. Using information about the statutory histories of the
              different state laws, we will explore the factors producing these different
              outcomes through a quantitative examination of the timing of changes in policy
              regimes across all states, and a more detailed case-oriented examination of
              several states that have recently changed their law. Although legal theorists
              and policy advocates have examined some aspects of the issue, our investigation
              will be the first systematic social scientific examination of felon
              disenfranchisement.
