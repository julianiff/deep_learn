Abstract    :
              Joyce / OCE-9818465
Recent observations for the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE)
period, the 1990s, will be used to extend an existing time
              series of the North
Atlantic Circulation. The goal is to examine if the
              Subtropical Mode water, the
Gulf Stream position and continue to co-vary with
              large scale atmospheric heat
and buoyancy forcing and a North Atlantic
              Oscillation index. The feedback
hypothesis to be tested is that the Gulf
              Stream separation point is influenced by
variability of the southward
              transport of Labrador Sea Water which then alter
storm racks and atmospheric
              forcing so as to negatively damp Labrador Sea
Water production.
