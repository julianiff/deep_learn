A workshop will be convened to investigate the feasibility
              of designing and establishing a network of Biological Observatories for
              long-term monitoring and research on biological diversity. Participants in the
              workshop will address the following questions: (1) What sort of sites might be
              included in a network of Biological Observatories? (2) What are the best
              mechanisms to measure biodiversity at different spatial scales? (3) What is the
              appropriate frequency of sampling for different taxa at these observatories?
              (4) How can we integrate these efforts with existing programs, such as PEET or
              the National Environmental Monitoring and Research Network? (5) What is the
              most appropriate information management system for biological observatories?
              These questions will be addressed at a small workshop to be held from 9-11
              September at the University of Virginia's Blandy Experimental Farm. It is
              anticipated that this workshop will lead to a larger more comprehensive meeting
              within a year following this meeting. This workshop will provide an important
              forum for input on the design and conceptual development of a network of
              biological observatories.
