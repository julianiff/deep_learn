              ABSTRACT

Wheeler, Craig
AST-9818960

This project involves a wide variety
              of theoretical and observational subprojects related to the study of
              supernovae.  The core effort is to better understand Type Ia supernovae and
              their use as standard cosmological distance indicators.  This involves a
              systematic study of the spectropolarimetric properties of supernovae and the
              prevalence of polarization and its possible relationship to asymmetry in the
              explosion event.  The team of collaborators is developing computer models for
              the polarization spectra of asymmetrical expanding envelopes of supernovae. 
              These models are matched to the spectropolarimetric observations the group
              collects at McDonald Observatory.  This effort will make heavy use of the
              Hobby-Eberle Telescope.  In a related effort, work will continue towards
              achieving a theoretical understanding of the thermonuclear 'combustion'
              processes distinguishing the so-called "dim" Type Ia supernovae that have been
              detected at large redshifts.
