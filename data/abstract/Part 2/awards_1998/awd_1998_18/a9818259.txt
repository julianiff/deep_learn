The low-temperature phases of matter and transitions between
              these phases in disordered systems in general, and in particular the quantum
              Hall regime in a two-dimensional electron gas with a high perpendicular
              magnetic field, will be studied using theoretical methods.  Specific phases of
              interest include the compressible and incompressible liquids in the quantum
              Hall effect.  This work will treat their elementary excitations, both in the
              bulk and at the edge, disorder effects, and universal critical properties of
              the transitions between distinct phases.  Other phases to be considered include
              quantum spin systems with quenched disorder.  The theoretical methods used will
              be mainly analytical, frequently based on many-body theory and both
              perturbative and non-perturbative quantum field theoretic techniques.  While
              the emphasis is on fundamental properties, applications to experiment will be
              made when possible.  Characterizing the phases and transitions theoretically
              will help determine which ones occur in experimental systems.  This is a
              renewal of a prior Presidential Young Investigator award.

This grant
              renewal of a prior Presidential Young Investigator award continues the support
              of a forefront theorist in many-body theoretical physics.  This project will
              focus on studying low-temperature behavior of electron states in a
              two-dimensional electron gas in a high perpendicular magnetic field-the quantum
              Hall regime.  Additional work will be carried out on understanding the behavior
              of quantum spin systems.  This work will enhance our understanding of the
              fractional quantum Hall effect, the central topic of the 1998 Nobel Prize in
              physics, and in general improve our theoretical understanding of many-body
              effects that are critical in determining the properties of a range of
              electronic and magnetic materials of technological importance.
