Agent-Based Research and Applications

This research
              instrumentation enables research projects in:

- Development Environment for
              Intelligent Agents,
- Binaural Localization and Interpretation of Sound
              Sources,
- Component Embeddable and Distributed Agents for Computer Integrated
              Manufacturing (CIM), and
- Agent-Based Multi-Media Distance Learning for
              CIM.

This award supports on-going research in the Department(s) of Computer,
              Information and Systems Engineering (CISE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) at
              San Jose State University and contributes to the purchase of an E450 server
              tower, two Pentium II, and a Fiber channel disk.  The objectives of the
              proposed four R&D projects include; (1) extending real-time object-oriented
              agent development system (ROADS) to allow users to specify their particular
              agent language using Abadi and Cardelli's object-oriented language model, (2)
              building ROADS agents for multi-sensor integration of sonar-localization, laser
              range-finding, and image data for mobile robot navigation and planning using
              the belief function and fuzzy logic calculi, (3) real-time binaural
              localization of multiple sources by clustering the spatial location of
              estimates from cepstral analyses and interaural time differences in multiple
              frequency bands, (4) building scalable multimedia servers and distance learning
              agents by applying system and content information in load balancing, data
              striping, and data recovery, (5) building agents that can control manufacturing
              processes and adapt to decentralized, evolving, and concurrent environments by
              representing diverse CIM knowledge and exploiting the ability to readily
              re-deploy ROADS agents.
