Laboratory data and a mathematical formulation known as
              Generalized Lagrangian Mean equations will to used to investigate the physical
              realizability of an instability mechanism (Craik-Leibovich, type 2) thought to
              be responsible for Langmuir circulation. The ultimate goal of the work is to
              develop a set of evolution equations that can be used to credibly estimate
              heat, mass and momentum transport within the ocean mixed layer.
