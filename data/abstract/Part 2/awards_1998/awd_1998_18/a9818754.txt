Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is organize a two-day conference to bring together
              researchers who have been studying how African Americans fared economically in
              the postbellum South with researchers who have been studying how African
              Americans fared in the early twentieth century North. The conference will
              explore links between these two areas of research in order to increase
              understanding of the economic progress of African Americans during the period
              between Emancipation and World War II. Both historians and economists will be
              participating in the conference, including African-American scholars from the
              historically black colleges. The papers presented at the conference will set
              out the latest research findings in these areas and will be included in an
              edited conference volume.
