This proposal will produce a CD-ROM that incorporates an
              inquiry-based approach designed to stimulate interest in science among Alaskan
              native middle school students.  Alaskan natives are under-represented in the
              scientific community; many avoid science, and some drop out of high school in
              part because content is delivered with a Eurocentric, rather than native,
              emphasis.  Typically, scientists from the lower US collect data in the arctic
              during the summer (when children are out of school), and the resulting
              interpretation is not shared with the people of the arctic.  The CD-ROM to be
              developed uses an innovative approach to "hook" the students' interest by
              showing the intersection and interaction of native environmental knowledge with
              the "modern" approach to scientific understanding.  Many examples in mainstream
              texts and lab manuals are not relevant to students living in Alaska, thereby
              creating disinterest in science.  This proposal will remedy that situation by
              making the content not only relevant, but also familiar and exciting at the
              same time. The CD-ROM will contain  1) story modules which discuss both
              scientific and native ways of understanding (with an option to choose among
              multiple storytellers),  2) twelve teaching modules with classroom lessons
              followed by adventure stories with scientific content and problem solving
              relevant to arctic communities, and 3) laboratory activities which include
              protocols for hands-on experiments and interpretation of existing data.  The
              modules will be linked to a web site maintained by the University of Colorado
              as well as other web sites.  The scientific content will be broad, including
              geology, biology, astronomy, climatology, earth science, etc.  The production
              of the CD-ROM will take four years, using an iterative evaluation and revision
              process.  500 copies of the CD-ROM will be distributed to classrooms in Alaska
              at a nominal cost, and the product will be advertised at national and regional
              meetings of NSTA and other educational organizations.
