Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the work of Dr. Cynthia J. Burrows in the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Utah.   The research extends earlier studies
              on nickel complex mediated oxidation of DNA by persulfuric acid, to the
              oxidation of nucleobases in DNA and RNA structures by a variety of oxidizing
              agents and transition metal complexes.   Of particular interest is the
              oxidation of guanine and further reactions of its common oxidation product,
              7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine.   
Results of these studies will have applications
              in toxicology, polynucleic acid structure, and nucleic acid-protein
              interactions.   The oxidation and subsequent degradation of DNA is implicated
              in the aging process and in the operation of a number of drugs, for example
              those used in the treatment of cancer.   Students trained on this project will
              gain valuable experience in bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry useful in a
              number of biotechnology fields.
