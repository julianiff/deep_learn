SAMSON--Scalable Active Memory Server on the Net

This research
              instrumentation enables research projects in:

- Computer Systems
              Research,
- XSB Tabled Logic Programming,
- Formal Verification and Model
              Checking, and
- Graphics.

The SAMSON project aims to build up a
              cluster-based network memory server.  Thus, to support the aforementioned
              projects, this award contributes to the purchase of several Compaq Alpha
              machines connected by four 8-port 1.2 Gigabit/sec Myrinet switches, with 21
              GBytes of main memory and 110 GBytes of disk space.  The software platform
              consists of the Linux operating system, the message passing library for Myrinet
              hardware, and a basic network paging subsystem.  Four research groups in the
              Computer Science
Department at the State University of New York-Stony Brook
              will benefit from the massive amount of memory in the SAMSON server.  1. The
              Systems group will use SAMSON to develop advanced network memory services such
              as application-specific storage management, as well as to gather access
              characteristics of memory-intensive applications.  2. The Formal Verification
              group will use SAMSON to re-examine space/time tradeoffs in new and existing
              verification algorithms.  3. The XSB group will exploit the memory in SAMSON to
              further the advances of tabling techniques in Logic Programming.  4. The
              Graphics/Visualization group will investigate the interaction of
              multi-resolution rendering with the memory hierarchy in SAMSON.  With SAMSON,
              the researchers will have access to an order of magnitude, more physical memory
              than is currently available, and will be able to experiment with regions of the
              design space that were not possible previously.
