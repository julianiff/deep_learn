Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to hold a workshop to address the problem of coastal erosion in
              the Arctic.  Erosion of the coastline may be responsible for delivering as much
              sediment to the shelf as the rivers currently deliver.  Workshop participants
              will document the dynamics of circum-Arctic coastlines including rates of
              transgression and regression as a function of ice content of permafrost, near
              shore bathymetry, and sea level changes.  The information from the workshop is
              important for developing models of coastal evolution in the Arctic because the
              impact of global warming could be greatest in the Arctic, particularly on
              coastal erosion.  The results of the workshop are important for assessing the
              impact of erosion on coastal communities as well as the delivery of increased
              sediments to the continental shelf.
