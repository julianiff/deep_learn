The inability of insect cells to generate glycoproteins similar
              in carbohydrate composition to those of mammalian cells has limited the wider
              application of insect cells as vehicles for the production of glycoproteins of
              mammalian origin.  While mammalian cells often produce glycoproteins containing
              complex oligosaccharides terminating in sialic acid, insect cells typically
              generate glycoforms containing short truncated oligosaccharides terminating in
              mannose or N-acetylglucosamine.  The composition of these covalently-attached
              carbohydrates, especially the presence of sialic acid, can significantly affect
              a glycoprotein's structure, stability, biologicaal activity, and in vivo
              circulatory half-life.  Consequently, the objective of this project is to
              manipulate carbohydrate processing pathways in insect cells in such a way that
              these cells will produce sialylated glycoproteins.  This inter-disciplinary and
              inter-agency project will involve participating scientists and engineers from
              Johns Hopkins University, the University of Wyoming, the Food and Drug
              Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Forest
              Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA).
