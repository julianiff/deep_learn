Abstract    :
              This project will test a hypothesis for the mid-Cretaceous tectonic evolution of
              a portion of the southwest Pacific Basin.  The hypothesis suggests that a
              plate-tectonic reorganization occurred soon after hotspot volcanism ceased on
              the Ontong Java and Manihiki plateaus, and the triple junction among the
              Pacific, Farallon, and Phoenix plates that had been located at the Nova Canton
              trough shifted to the northeast corner of the Manihiki plateau.  A usrvey with
              multibeam bathymetric, side-scan, magnetometer, and shipboard and satellite
              gravity will determine the track of the triple junction.
