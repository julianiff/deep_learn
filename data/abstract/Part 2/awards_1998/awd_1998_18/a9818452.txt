This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will provide funds for acquisition of current meter electronics
              to modernize 39 vector measuring current meters operated as shared-use
              instrumentation by researchers at several U.S. academic institutions.  An
              additional 39 units will be acquired with support from the Defense University
              Research Instrumentation Program (DoD/Navy).  This capability will
              substantially improve capabilities for supporting studies of ocean currents by
              U.S. ocean scientists.
