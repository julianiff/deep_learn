Abstract    :
              A combine experimental and theoretical study of the creep fracture in
              unidirectional, graphite fiber/polymer-matrix composite materials in tension is
              conducted. Creep fracture is important in various applications such as filament
              wound pressure vessels, putruded rods and beams, offshore platform stabilizing
              cables and pipes, all of which sustain high loads for long times. The model
              incorporates micromechanical and statistical failure processes in the
              composite, and yields probability distributions for strength and long-term
              lifetime. Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (MRS) is used to study matrix  creep and
              time-dependent interfacial debond and slip phenomena at length scales closer to
              fiber diameter. Fast comutational micromechanics model for the composite is
              developed that provides stress and displacement fields for large random arrays
              of fiber breaks and break clusters for use in large Monte Carlo simulations.
              The MRS experiments and computational model are interactively used to interpret
              experimental stress profiles as they change over time.
