Abstract    :
              	The goal of this project is to find out how strategic considerations of
              political parties affect women's parliamentary participation.  The grant is
              used to support a comparative study of six OECD countries:  Sweden, the
              Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and the United States.  The
              first component of the project is in-depth, qualitative interviews with 54
              party officials (two from each significant party) in each of these countries. 
              The interview data clarify whether three factors -- the salience of women's
              issues in the media, party ideology, and the rise of egalitarian new parties --
              produce strategic inventives for political parties to promote women.
	The
              second component of the project is the distribution of 2,430 multiple-choice
              questionnaires to all members of parliament (MPs) in these six countries.  The
              responses of the MPs to the questions concerning the impact of the three
              factors mentioned above is analyzed to find out if they are correlated
              statistically with the party's performance in recruiting female MPs.
	Both of
              these components are part of a larger project which includes indirect measures
              of the three factors and time series analysis.  Each part enhances our
              understanding of the mechanisms that underlie gender equality in our
              parliaments.  Thus, each is a step toward developing effective strategies to
              improve our democracies.
