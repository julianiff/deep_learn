Abstract    :
              The PI will perform a tomographic analysis and wide-angle migration of marine
              shots recorded by receivers onshore and offshore Yucatan to study the structure
              of the Chicxulub impact crater. The analysis could provide new constraints on
              aspects of the central structure of the impact crater, e.g., deep basement
              uplift and position of the Moho underneath, obliquity of the impact, and
              geometry and volume of the impact melt sheet. This is a joint project between
              University of Texas at Austin and Imperial College, London.
