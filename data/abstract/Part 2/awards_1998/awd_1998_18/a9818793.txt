Funding is provided to evaluate the initial operation of
              the first cabled deep seafloor observatory and to make plans for it futures.
              The Hawaii Undersea Geo-Observatory (HUGO) was developed and installed as an
              automated submarine volcano observatory on the summit of the undersea Loihi
              seamount approximately 50 miles due south of Kilauea volcano on the island of
              Hawaii  It is connected to the shore via fiber optic cable. HUGO was designed
              to monitor activity on Loihi by collecting data from a variety of experiments
              that were to be connected to a junction box at the end of the cable.  At its
              deployment in October 1997, these experiments included a seismometer, a
              hydrophone and a pressure sensor. Other proposed sensors would monitor
              earthquakes and eruptions, geology, geophysics, biology, hydrothermal venting
              and other activities on the underwater seamount. The system operated and
              collected data for seven months, until April 26, 1998, when an electrical
              failure terminated operations. Seven months of continuous seafloor measurements
              will be worked up for publication. The seafloor junction box will also be
              recovered, and a study will be undertaken to evaluate the failure mode of the
              observatory in order to determine whether a repair or re-installation is
              scientifically warranted or technically feasible.
