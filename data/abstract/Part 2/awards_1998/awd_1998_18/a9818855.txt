Abstract

Because they explicitly recognize and measure
              uncertainty about the future. probability forecasts ("the probability is 0.6
              that the product will be successful") are more informative and more valuable to
              decision makers that categorical forecasts ("the product will be successful"). 
              Previous work on forecast evaluation has focused extensively on categorical
              forecasts.  The goal of this research is to develop new procedures that can
              improve forecasting and decision making in practice by improving how we
              evaluate probability forecasts.  This will help in the determination of how
              useful different forecasts are and the comparison of the sources of the
              forecasts (which could be data, models, or experts).  It will also provide
              important diagnostic guidance as to how future forecasts might be improved and
              enable users to tailor evaluation schemes to particular decision-making
              problems.  Finally, it will provide a better understanding of how combining
              probabilities from different sources can yield better forecasts.
