Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at developing a theory of mental representation that can
              account for our ability to perceive, remember, and imagine the meaningful
              spatial relations that comprise real-world scenes, when the input on which
              scene perception is based is at any given moment fragmentary.  The perceiver
              somehow manages to integrate a continuous series of partial views of the
              environment into a smooth overall percept of a world of complex interrelated
              collections of objects and backgrounds.  The research studies how this is
              done.

The funding provided by this grant will be added to other existing
              funding for the project, to help support the cost of a full-time Laboratory
              Coordinator, who will schedule experiments, help prepare stimuli, monitor the
              progress of the experiments, and maintain laboratory records and data files,
              among other responsibilities.
