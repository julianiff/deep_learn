An experimental study will be conducted to investigate the
              high-temperature corrosion behavior of iron and nickel aluminides at elevated
              temperatures in environments, which contain oxygen and chlorine.  Gas
              chemistry, temperature and gas flow rate will be varied.  Kinetic results from
              thermogravimetric measurements and microstructure studies will be analyzed
              using a comprehensive thermodynamics approach.  The corrosion mechanism will be
              elucidated and the corrosion process will be modeled mathematically.  Attempts
              will be made to model the conditions of alloy composition and environment,
              which result in development of a protective and adhesive scale.
