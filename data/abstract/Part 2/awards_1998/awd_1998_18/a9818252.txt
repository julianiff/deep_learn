This planning grant, sponsored by Southwest Texas State
              University, will carry out a planning program to prepare schools in the San
              Marcos (Texas) School District to undertake a Secondary Science Local Systemic
              Reform project. The proposed full proposal will ask for funds to re-organize
              the entire 6-12 science curriculum to bring about careful articulation in
              grades 6-12 and to prepare teachers in more in-depth content and thereby
              learning to use high quality curriculum materials. The actual planning
              activities include gathering information on exemplary curriculum materials,
              researching effective strategies for professional development, deciding upon an
              effective curriculum and developing outreach activities for neighboring
              districts.
