The top quark is by far the heaviest of the six types of
              quarks we know to exist. Since it is so heavy, it can currently only be
              produced at the Fermilab Tevatron. The PI is a leader in the efforts to
              understand the decays of the top quark. This research program will allow him to
              continue his focus on studying the decays of this particle, and will enable him
              to work on upgrading the CDF detector so that a much higher statistics sample
              of top quark decays can be accumulated. This will allow the Standard Model to
              be probed in a new energy region and may reveal new physics. In addition, the
              PI is working on a project to use Java to set up a series of interactive
              physics demonstrations on the World Wide Web.
