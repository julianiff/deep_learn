Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the work of Dr. Peter Stang in the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Utah.   The research extends his earlier work on
              making metallocyclic supramolecular squares to preparing a variety of more
              complex molecular architectures, including  pentagons, hexagons, cubes,
              octahedra, , dodecahedra, and adamantanoids.   These structures self-assemble
              as a result of relatively strong bonds between transition metals and ligating
              atoms in the molecular subassemblies, and can be constructed with precisely
              defined shapes and sizes.
If fully successful, this research will lead to
              novel solid state materials useful for a variety of applications, including
              catalysts, sensors, and electronic materials.
