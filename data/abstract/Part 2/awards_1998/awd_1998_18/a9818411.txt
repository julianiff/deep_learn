Probabilistic considerations arise in the analysis of
              algorithms in at least two important ways.  First of all, in a randomized
              algorithm the outcomes of random events are used to determine the progress of
              the algorithm.  Randomization is now a standard tool of the computer scientist.
               A second area of consideration is when the problem instances come from some
              probability distribution and one wants to understand the average performance of
              a particular algorithm, which is often far better than its worst case.

This
              project attacks a number of problems in these two areas.  Topic considered in
              the area of randomized algorithms included decomposition of matrices, random
              walks, rapidly mixing Markov chains and min-wise independence.  Topics
              considered in probabilistic analysis include approximation algorithms, packet
              routing and computational biology.
