Abstract    :
              The aims of the planned research are to simulate thermospheric phenomena which
              occur in response to magnetospheric substorms.  In particular, recently
              observed phenomena within the recovery phase post-midnight diffuse aurora which
              have not yet been explained will be investigated, as well as the response to
              expansion phase surges which has not previously been evaluated.  Since the
              processes that occur at high latitudes during substorms may have effects
              globally, these poorly understood phenomena are important for the thermosphere
              as a whole.  The proposed research will make use of a 3-dimen-sional
              time-dependent limited area high resolution model, recently developed at UCLA. 
              A much higher resolution will be used than has been used in the past to model
              shears and instabilities in the auroral zone which should enable them to be
              simulated successfully for the first time.  The UCLA model is non-hydrostatic,
              time dependent and composition dependent.  The CTIM model will be used to
              provide large scale winds, temperatures and tidal structures as inputs to the
              UCLA model.
