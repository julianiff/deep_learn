Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102.   It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications involve
              n-dimensional physics based visualizations, creation of a "vision environment"
              that includes medical imaging in support of image guided surgery, 3D virtual
              reality digital imaging and VRML development, molecular modeling for
              pharmaceuticals development, and distributed shared memory multi-computing in a
              wide-area networking environment.   Other efforts include intelligent peptide
              library searching, materials research utilizing remote operation of
              instrumentation,  and the study of general circulation of planetary atmospheric
              research.   Collaborating institutions include: Cornell Theory Center, Harvard
              Medical School, Brigham Women's Hospital, NCSA at Urbana-Champaign, Oak-Ridge
              National Laboratory, University of Kentucky, J. B. Speed Art Museum, and the
              Lutz Microfabrication Laboratory.
