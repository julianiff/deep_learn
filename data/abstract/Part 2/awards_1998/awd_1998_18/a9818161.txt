Abstract    :
              This research is focused on investigating the physical mechanisms which control
              the generation of thunderstorms in preferred regions of the Rocky Mountains. 
              Specifically, the Principal Investigators will seek to determine the relative
              role of the dynamic and thermal effects of the mountains and the larger scale
              synoptic forcing in controlling the locations where thunderstorms form.  The
              Principal Investigators will use a combination of numerical model simulations,
              actual data and statistical analyses to accomplish the research
              objectives.

The results of this project are expected to aid in the
              forecasting of precipitation and severe weather.  Systems of thunderstorms
              known as mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are responsible for much of the
              Spring/Summer rainfall and severe weather in the U.S.   These MCSs often begin
              as smaller convective systems in and near the Rocky Mountains.  Better
              understanding of the initiation of the Rocky Mountain systems should contribute
              to better forecasts of MCSs.
