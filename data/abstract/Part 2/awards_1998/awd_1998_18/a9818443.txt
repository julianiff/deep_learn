The Emerging Sources of RNA Information workshop will bring
              together investigators from diverse fields of RNA research to address issues
              associated with the recent explosion of RNA-based information and the
              development of RNA informatics resources. The objectives will be to identify
              both emerging sources of RNA information and critical information/informatics
              resources.  This workshop is designed to full a unique need not currently
              addressed by RNA meetings, which typically focus on specific sub-disciplines,
              or genomics and informatics conferences that emphasize DNA and protein
              analyses.  An overall theme of RNA informatics will promote communication among
              diverse fields of RNA research and identify developing information resources in
              four major areas of investigation: RNA genomics, RNA structure, RNA-protein
              interactions and RNA catalysis.
