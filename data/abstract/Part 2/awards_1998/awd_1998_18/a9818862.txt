The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) is
              managing a project to provide travel grants for teachers and other mathematics
              educators to attend and participate in the Ninth International Congress on
              Mathematical Education (ICME-9) in Makuhari, Japan from 30 July to 6 August,
              2000.  NCTM administers the grant program and provides approximately 40 travel
              grants to key elementary, middle and high school teachers and supervisors,
              community college and college/university mathematics teachers, teacher
              educators and researchers in the United States.  Additionally, a document is
              developed on the state of mathematics education in the United States and
              disseminated at the Congress.  Twelve of the travelers spend an additional
              eight days in Japan interacting with and learning from teachers and other
              educators in that country.
