Abstract    :
              This project will examine the spatial and temporal record of terrigenous
              material in sediments of the deep Atlantic Ocean.  Grainsize and geochemical
              analyses of particles will be analyzed in surface sediments throughout the
              ocean, in order to distinguish sources (geochemistry) and transport mode
              (grainsize).  Similar analyses will be conducted in a core off West Africa to
              determine temporal variability of eolian deposition (hence wind strength and
              continental aridity) from the Sahel and Sahara over the last glacial/
              interglacial cycle.  The project will be performed by undergraduate students,
              providing a research experience opportunity at an undergraduate department.
