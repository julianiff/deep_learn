This
              project will establish a Science Management Office (SMO) to enhance
              coordination of research efforts in the Russian-American Initiative on
              Shelf-land Environments (RAISE) project. The RAISE project is an international
              project to study the environment in the important land to sea transition zone
              that will be affected by global change such as warmer temperatures and rising
              sealevel. The RAISE SMO will include: organization of investigator meetings;
              publishing updates of RAISE implementation plans; facilitating communication
              and exchange of information; ensure timely submission of data to the data
              archive; providing support for the international RAISE steering committee.
