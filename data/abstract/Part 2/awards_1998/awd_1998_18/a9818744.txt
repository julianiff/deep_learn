The anatomy of mantle plumes, and
              melting processes within them, remain enigmatic and controversial issues
              despite numerous attempts to investigate them.  The main obstacle to
              understanding plumes has been our past two-dimensional approach in examining
              them.  The discovery of giant landslides on the flanks of Mauna Loa provides an
              opportunity to sample the products of plume processes in the third dimension. 
              This study will extend our knowledge of the magmatic history Mauna Loa's, the
              world's largest volcano, by -200,000 years, should provide fundamental insights
              into the development of hotspot-generated volcanoes and clafify longstanding
              controversies concerning the structure and dynamics of the Hawaiian plume.  We
              will also examine the following hypotheses:  Hawaiian volcanoes were derived
              from some of the hottest magmas erupted in 100 million years and oceanic island
              volcanoes are dominantly comprised of fragmental lava rather than pillow lava
              (which has implications for the geologic hazards on all oceanic islands).
