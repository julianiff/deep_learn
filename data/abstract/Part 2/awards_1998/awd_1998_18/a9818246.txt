This proposal is a contribution the the AIMS (Analysis,
              Interpretation, Modeling, and Synthesis) phase of the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE).  During the WOCE Indian Ocean Survey, current meters were
              deployed across each of the three systems of deep western-boundary currents at
              Latitude 20 degrees South (adjacent to the eastern flanks of Madagascar, the
              Central Indian Ridge, and the Ninetyeast Ridge).  CTD (Conductivity /
              Temperature / Depth) sections were occupied along the mooring lines during both
              deployment and recovery.  The PI in this project will collaborate with
              scientists at TAMU and Oregon State University on the analysis of the joint
              current measurements and water property data.  A calculation of the mean
              transport and time variations of the Circumpolar Deep Water in these currents
              will provide an estimate of the strength of the meridional overturning
              circulation (MOC) in the Indian Ocean.  Earlier indirect calculations have
              indicated that the MOC is anomalously large in the Indian Ocean relative to
              that in the Pacific, but early indications from the current meter records
              refute this.  Near Madagascar, a surprising, strong southward flow at mid
              depths has been observed, and this anomaly needs to be carefully documented,
              along with its implications for the ocean-wide meridional overturning.
