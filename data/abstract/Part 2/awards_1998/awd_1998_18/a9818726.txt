Building on prior development and laboratory tests of acoustic
              rain
sensing technology,  field-deployable acoustic rain gages will
              be
constructed and tested under operational conditions.  The acoustic
gages
              will be mounted on two TAO moorings in the tropical Pacific.
Data from the
              acoustic instruments will be compared with data from
capacitance rain gages
              located on the same moorings and with rainfall
estimates deduced from
              satellite observations.  The rainfall observations will be combined with upper
              ocean salinity measurements
from the moorings to examine the fresh water
              budget of the upper ocean.
