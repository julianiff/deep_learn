Abstract    :
              During subduction, altered ocean crust and sediments dehydrate and these fluids
              react with the overlying sub-arc mantle.  Knowledge of such fluids and
              reactions is critical to understanding chemical cycling in subduction zones,
              and what is ultimately recycled into the mantle. Conical and Torishima
              Seamounts in the Mariana and Izu-Bonin forearcs are serpentinite protrusions
              that result from large scale hydration of the forearc mantle wedge by
              dewatering of the underlying subducting slab. The proposed project will analyze
              the stable isotopic (O,H,S,C) compositions, opaque mineralogy, and sulfur
              contents of serpentinized mantle peridotites from these two seamounts.  The
              objectives are 1. to determine the conditions of serpentinization at depth, 2.
              constrain the compositions of serpentinizing fluids and how they relate to
              those sampled at the surface, and 3. test the prediction from the sulfur
              isotope ratios of arc volcanics that a seawater sulfur component is present in
              slab-derived fluids.  Results will provide a better understanding of
              metamorphic processes, conditions of hydration reactions, and fluid
              compositions at depth, as well as constraints on the thermal structure of the
              forearc mantle wedge.  This study will provide fundamental data necessary for
              the evaluation of models for the thermal structure and hydration reactions in
              subduction zones.
