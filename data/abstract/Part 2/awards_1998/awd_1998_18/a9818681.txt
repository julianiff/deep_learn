Abstract    :
              The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP) is a joint
              committee of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of
              Engineering (NAE), and the Institute of Medicine.

COSEPUP organizes panel
              discussions at regular COSEPUP meetings on emerging policy issues such as
              whether the United States should create a Department of Science, the flow of
              science and engineering talent into United States, and research and the
              Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).  Issues for panel discussions
              are generated from news articles, congressional interest, or letters from
              outside parties as well as COSEPUP members.  As a result of these discussions,
              COSEPUP occasionally decides an issue is worth pursuing and an in-depth study
              is conducted.  In other cases, the issues are sufficiently illuminated that no
              additional action is warranted.  In yet other cases, COSEPUP decides to monitor
              an issue over time to see if an activity is warranted.

This award funds two
              panel discussions at each of COSEPUP quarterly 2-day meetings.  The exact
              topics will be determined just in advance of the meetings to enable COSEPUP to
              address "hot topics."  Agencies may suggest issues of concern to them as can
              any interested party.
