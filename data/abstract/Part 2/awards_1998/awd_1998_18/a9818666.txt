This project at Boston University is developing six
              interactive modules for high school mathematics classrooms that deal with
              aspects of the geometry and algebra of chaos and fractals.  Each module is a
              completely interactive Java applet and is available free on a Boston University
              web server.  The evaluation includes a study of effective ways teachers use
              these materials in mathematics classes.  The Linear Web applet allows students
              to enter a particular linear function and then view the associated graphical
              iteration and time series.  The Nonlinear Web applet allows students to view
              the results of graphical iteration of nonlinear functions.  Target Practice
              helps students comprehend the notion of graphical iteration in a "game"
              setting.  The Orbit Diagram applet brings together the concepts from the
              previous modules by painting various orbit diagrams.  The Mandelbrot and Julia
              Set applet assists with visualization of complex iteration.  A sixth applet,
              The Mandelbrot and Julia Set Explorer, is a completely interactive primer
              dealing with the mathematics of these Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
