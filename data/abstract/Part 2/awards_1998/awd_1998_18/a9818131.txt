              Government Initiative Workshops

This award will support two workshops
              related to the NSF/CISE Digital Government program.  The first workshop will
              cover the topical area of Geographical Information Systems, and will identify
              opportunities for the application of research in information technology to
              increase the usefulness and usability of GIS.  The non-profit OpenGIS
              Consortium will assist in bringing the appropriate individuals to the workshop.
               The second workshop, entitled Government Operations & Services, will be
              conducted with the assistance of the Center for Technology in Government at the
              State University of New York - Albany, and will be a multidisciplinary
              assessment of the organizational, intergovernmental, and technological factors
              that shape government's ability to integrate advanced information technologies
              into internal operations and public services.
