The Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications
              (COMAP) is producing 35 replacement units for the high school curriculum with a
              strong emphasis on technical applications found in the workplace.  Each unit is
              expected to take between one and three weeks of classroom time.  The units are
              designed so they can be used as supplementary units for a traditional or a
              reform-based core curriculum.  This design is based on the belief that all
              students will benefit from a better understanding of mathematics that is
              important in the workplace.  The inclusion of a focus on reform-based curricula
              is a recognition of the need for continued renewal of context/applications
              based approaches to teaching and learning mathematics.  A system is being set
              in place to provide for the continual renewal of this curriculum theme through
              the development, review, and field testing of new units.  The initial set of 35
              units is being produced in print and electronic format by the COMAP author
              team, who along with a distinguished advisory board sets formats for submission
              of continuing units from the field.
