In this project PIs will analyze data from Acoustic Doppler
              Current Profilers (ADCP) used during the Indian Ocean Survey carried out as
              part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Shipboard ADCPs
              provided high resolution sections of velocity in the upper 300 meters along the
              survey lines.  Lowered ADCPs (LADCP) provided full depth profiles at every
              hydrographic station along the tracks.  The central objective is to describe
              the ocean current field in the Indian Ocean, with emphasis on the deep lowered
              ADCP data set.  The study will also include use of other parameters measured
              such as temperature, salinity, chemical tracers, float and drifter tracks,
              satellite altimetric sea level measurements, etc.  Observed currents will be
              compared with numerical general circulation model output to evaluate the
              models' ability to mimic the phenomena and dynamics of the ocean.
