Abstract    :
              Goldman

As part of an Accomplishments-Based Renewal, the Principal
              Investigator will synthesize and put into perspective the work he has
              accomplished by preparing a number of manuscripts on topics covering areas in
              phytoplankton and microbial ecology.  The manuscripts proposed include the
              following:  an historical and comprehensive review on the use of batch and
              continuous cultures in marine phytoplankton ecology; a re-evaluation of the
              utility of the Redfield ratio as a diagnostic tool for determining the
              physiological state of cultured and natural phytoplankton populations; a
              synthesis of the temporal and spatial scales of marine primary productivity; an
              analysis of nutrient cycling and energy flow in the microbial loop; and a
              review of phytoplankton-mediated changes in the chemistry of seawater.  These
              topics have interwoven themes regarding the ways in which phytoplankton
              contribute to the flow of energy and materials in the marine food web.
