The Tool Kit for Early Childhood Science Education, produced
              by the Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) is a comprehensive set of
              materials designed to improve science teaching and learning in early childhood
              centers for preschool children ages 3 to 5.  The materials support
              administrators, staff developers, teachers, and families in developing the
              knowledge and skills they need to bring quality science education to the young
              children in their programs.  The Tool Kit provides the early childhood and
              science education communities with a new understanding of young children's
              capabilities and a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of science
              education in the many and varied early childhood programs throughout the
              country.
Specifically the Tool Kit Provides:

A Framework for Early
              Childhood Science Instruction
Three Curriculum Guides (Earth, Physical, and
              Life Science)
A Guide For Staff Developers
Support Materials for Early
              Childhood Program Administrators
Parent Materials
Videotapes of Classroom
              Practice

The work of this project is based on the knowledge that has emerged
              from decades of research into the cognitive development of young children, as
              well as experience and research into developmentally appropriate practice.  It
              is grounded in the work of the National Association for the Education of Young
              Children (NAEYC) and the views of science and scientific inquiry as expressed
              in the National Science Education Standards.  Finally, it draws from work of
              two centers within EDC, the Center for Science Education with over 10 years of
              experience working on urban systemic reform and developing curriculum materials
              in science, and the Center for Children & Families with 21 years of involvement
              with Head Start.  The materials will be piloted in five early childhood centers
              in the Boston area and will be field tested in over one hundred classrooms in
              30 early childhood centers from across the country.
