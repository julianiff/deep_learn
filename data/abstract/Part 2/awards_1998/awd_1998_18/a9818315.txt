              Instrumentation:  A Broadband Software Radio Testbed for Research in Wireless
              Communications

This research instrumentation enables research projects
              in:

- Wireless Laboratory Enhancement,
- DSP Solutions for Low Complexity
              Multi-User Detectors,  and
- Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation for Wireless
              Data Network.

To support the aforementioned projects, the Department of
              Electrical
Engineering at the University of Washington will purchase microware
              testing
equipment and computing facilities for upgrading an existing
              wireless
communication laboratory.  The equipment is used to set up a
              broadband
software radio testbed which consists of a multichannel RF
              transceiver
module, a multiple broadband data acquisition system (>10Ms/c/s),
              an
arbitrary RF signal generator, and a wireless channel fading simulator. 
              The
new testbed enables experimental research in the areas of
              broadband
multiple-access, multiuser detection, time/space diversity
              combining,
wireless networking, as well as other potential multidisciplinary
              research
related to personal communication services (PCS).  Both the quality
              and
scope of on-going and future research in wireless technology is 
              enhanced
by the proposed instrumentation.  Anticipated impacts of this
              project
include larger capacity, better interference and fading resistance,
              and
higher power efficiency and system flexibility for wireless systems.
