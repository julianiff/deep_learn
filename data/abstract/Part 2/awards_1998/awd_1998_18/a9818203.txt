Abstract    :
              The principal investigator proposes a coordinated experimental and numerical
              study of the flow and heat transfer in the separated and reattached flow
              regions in the three dimensional geometry of a backward facing step.  A
              laser-Doppler velocimeter will be used to measure the local velocity components
              simultaneously with the measurement of the heat transfer coefficient using
              liquid crystal thermography.  The focus will be on determining the effect of
              the heat transfer and the buoyancy on the mean and fluctuating velocity
              components.  Reynolds shear stresses, normal stresses, and heat transfer
              coefficients will be determined.

The backward facing step will be used for
              the flow configuration since it contains most of the complexities that are
              encountered in three dimensional separated flow regions:  a free shear layer;
              strong adverse pressure gradient; interaction of the shear layer and the wall;
              and reattachment.
