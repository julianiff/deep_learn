Abstract    :
              This project will adapt a sonar system for acoustic imaging of hydrothermal flow
              regimes for use on the ROV  Jason.  The sonar system wil be used to image, map
              and quantitatively measure hydrothermal plumes and diffuse flow over a range of
              spatial and temporal scales on the main Endeavor vent field on the Juan de Fuca
              Ridge.  Advanced computer visualization and analytical methods will be used to
              identify, extract and measure paramentes of plumes and diffuse flow to
              determine mixing and dispersal behavior of these flow regimes.
