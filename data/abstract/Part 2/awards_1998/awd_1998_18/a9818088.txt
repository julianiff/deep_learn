Abstract    :
              	Jet streaks, small areas of accelerated flow embedded in the broader rapidly
              moving jet streams of the upper troposphere, are associated with rapid
              cyclogenesis, heavy precipitation, and severe convective storms; hence, are of
              major interest for weather forecasting.  The principal investigator, Dr.
              Keyser, will explore the nature of jet streaks, looking at their
              three-dimensional structure using observational and diagnostic analyses and
              employing several models - a quasi-geostrophic and primitive equation channel
              models.  He hypothesizes that polar-front jets often result from the
              superposition of upper level monopolar or dipolar vortices of sub-synoptic
              dimensions on the large-scale jet stream.  The vortices "induce" jet streaks. 
              The investigation will focus on the three-dimensional structure of the jet
              streaks, along with the associated rotational and divergent ageostrophic
              circulations and vertical motions.
