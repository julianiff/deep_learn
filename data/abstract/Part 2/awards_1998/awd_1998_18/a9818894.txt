Abstract    :
              Several fundamental aspects of the ways in which potential vorticity 
is
              injected into the large-scale ocean circulation are investigated. 
The three
              main tasks are:  a study of the injection of potential
vorticity into the
              ocean interior from sloping side boundaries, the
development of a better
              understanding of the processes that determine
the structures of subpolar
              gyres, and a study of the process of 
subduction of potential vorticity from
              the ocean mixed layer in the 
presence of strong separated boundary currents
              and a mesoscale eddy 
field.
