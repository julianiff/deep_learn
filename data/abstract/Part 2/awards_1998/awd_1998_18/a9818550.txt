This project addresses pattems of biodiversity and
              convergence at deep-sea hydrothermal vents using fauna associated with mussel
              beds for comparisons at various spatial, temporal and contextual scales,
              including: i) within a vent field, ii) annually at a single vent field over
              three years, iii) among vent fields of different ages on a ridge segment, iv)
              among segments of different spreading rates on a single ridge system, and v)
              between ridge systems in different ocean basins. Biodiversity contrasts at
              these scales repeatedly arise in discussions of vent ecology and deep-sea
              ecology, but to date there is no quantitative information to allow
              comparisons.
This research will develop from an ongoing comparison of
              biodiversity at Lucky Strike mussel beds on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and an
              intertidal mussel bed on the south central Alaskan coast. An intensive field
              program is designed to sample a variety of mussel bed sites on the East Pacific
              Rise and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The field programs are envisioned primarily as
              add-ons to programs developed by other scientists. All cruises and sampling
              involve the use of the Alvin. Dive sites for comparative biodiversity studies
              are hoped to include 11 N, 9N and 17S on the East Pacific Rise (i.e., two
              "fast' and "superfast" spreading segments) and Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, and
              Snake Pit on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Vent ecosystems on oceanic spreading
              centers provide extreme examples of fragmented metapopulations on a global
              scale. Patterns of diversity and convergence in these communities will provide
              fundamental insights into regional-scale control of community structure.
