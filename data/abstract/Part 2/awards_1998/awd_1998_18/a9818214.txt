Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the studies of Dr. Dale Margerum, Department of
              Chemistry, Purdue University, which will provide (i) a fundamental knowledge
              base in the area of inorganic solution chemistry, in particular the
              reactivities of oxohalogen species in aqueous media, (ii) further development
              of a novel spectroscopic tool to investigate fast reactions, and (iii) which
              will examine the reactivities of nickel(III) and copper(III)-peptide complexes
              to gain an understanding of their role in site-specific DNA damage.

These
              studies are wide-ranging in scope. Results will be of benefit to understanding
              the chemistry taking place in the environment (oceans, lakes, rivers and in
              atmospheric cloud droplets). The knowledge base resulting from these studies
              will also be of benefit to the pulp and paper industry and other allied
              industries that use halooxo substances in aquatic media, and whose annual sales
              reach about $180 billions. The studies will provide an excellent training
              ground for undergraduate and graduate students.
