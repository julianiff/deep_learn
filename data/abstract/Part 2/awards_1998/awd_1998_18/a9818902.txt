Productivity growth and technical
              progress are closely related phenomena. Moreover, technical progress in one
              location frequently goes hand in hand with productivity growth elsewhere,
              partly because technological knowledge is non-rival. Technology diffusion is
              the process by which R&D in one industry benefits productivity in another
              industry, and R&D in one country increases the productivity in another country.
                Recent research in growth theory holds that economic integration at the
              industry as well as at the country level facilitates technology diffusion and
              the spatial distribution of productivity growth. This project seeks to quantify
              the contribution of economic integration to technology diffusion and
              productivity growth and to distinguish different channels through which it does
              so. The results from this research will have implications for economic policies
              towards science and technology, trade, and international investment, which have
              a considerable impact on welfare due to the relationship between productivity
              and economic well-being.
