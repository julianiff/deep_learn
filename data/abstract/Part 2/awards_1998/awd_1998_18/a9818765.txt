Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced
              difficulty instituting competitive, multi-party democratic systems.  During the
              wave of democratization following 1989, observers were optimistic about the
              prospects for democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa.  However, several of the newly
              democratizing countries in southern Africa now are moving in the direction of
              dominant-party democracy.  This Dissertation research support singles out the
              activities of political parties, particularly the opposition, for their
              critical importance in understanding the ways in which democratic systems are
              becoming institutionalized.  The author creates and tests a theory of
              opposition party success and failure in dominant-party democratic systems. The
              ultimate objective is to construct a theoretic framework that is useful for
              analyzing party success and failure in countries around the world.

The
              investigator uses field research data from case studies in three provinces of
              South Africa.  These provinces were selected because they contain opposition
              parties and they represent the widest possible cross-section of  South African
              society.
