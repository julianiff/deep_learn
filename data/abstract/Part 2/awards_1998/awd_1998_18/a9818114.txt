Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project will replicate the work of Kempton, Boster,
              and Hartley exploring the cultural bases for environmental concern, by using a
              comparative design based on qualitative interviews in Germany, Japan, and the
              United States. The technological infrastructures in these three nations are
              very similar and thus are the environmental problems they face. All three are
              industrial democracies, although the political systems differ. However, the
              three nations have very different cultural lineages, especially with regards to
              values and religions. Thus research in Germany and Japan triangulated with
              Kempton et al. 's results for the United States, provide an ideal base for
              cross-cultural comparison. Qualitative, in-depth interviews will be conducted
              with members of the general public, auto workers, clergy, environmental
              journalists, and government officials in Germany and Japan. Analysis will
              emphasize recent theories of environmental concerns, especially works on values
              and religion, and the cross-cultural convergences and differences.
