The project is for a modeling study of meso-scale eddies in a
              wind-driven ocean gyre.  A new quasi-geostrophic model and pattern recognition
              algorithm will be developed.  A series of experiments with different wind
              forcing will be used to explore the relationship between eddy population and
              the mean flow.  The study will quantify interaction between meso-scale eddies
              and large scale circulation in a turbulent ocean gyre.
