Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to isolate the sediment component(s) containing
              "excess Al"--Al that is not incorporated in lithic particles.  Previous work
              suggests that Al may be absorbed or adsorbed onto biogenic particles, and could
              be an indicator of particle flux and therefore of export production.  The
              rpoject will use sequential extractions to examine the Al present in the
              following components; carbonates (forminifera), opal (radiolaria, diatoms),
              organics, oxides, and terrigenous particles.
