This research deals with the diffusion of adatoms and molecules
              on metals and
semiconductors. Three specific investigations will be performed.
              1) The diffusion of hydrogen across step edges on vicinal Ni(111); 2) the
              classical and quantum diffusion of hydrogen on Cu(111); as well as  3) the
              classical and quantum diffusion of hydrogen on Nb(100) surfaces will be
              investigated.   Among the questions to be answered are 1) what is the potential
              energy barrier for a hydrogen atom to cross an atomic step that separates two
              Ni(111) terraces? 2a) Since the hydrogen absorption on Cu(111) is similar to
              that on Ni(111), will the quantum diffusion of hydrogen on Cu(111) emulate that
              on Ni(111)? and 2b)How does the quantum diffusion of hydrogen on Cu(11) compare
              with that of hydrogen and positive muons in Cu?; and similar questions with
              respect to the diffusion of hydrogen on Nb(100).  These investigations will
              provide an improved understanding of the interactions between atoms/molecules
              and surfaces.  Graduate students and post doctoral research associates will
              participate in these researches.

The bonding of atoms and molecules to
              metallic surfaces plays an extremely important role in modern technology. 
              Catalysis, adhesion of coatings, corrosion, and other phenomena all depend on
              the interactions between atoms and molecules and metallic surfaces on which
              they are adsorbed.  One of the important parameters that describes these
              interactions is the diffusion of atoms across the surface.  The interaction
              between hydrogen atoms and well characterized metal surfaces constitutes a
              model system for such investigations.  The results of these studies will bring
              about a better understanding of the behavior of atoms and molecules adsorbed on
              metal surfaces and ultimately an improved technology.  Graduate students and
              post doctoral research associates participate in this research.  They will
              thereby acquire skills and training in a field with great potential for
              employment during the next several decades of the 21st Century.
