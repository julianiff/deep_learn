Abstract    :
              Studies of the paleoclimatic history of continental areas are important to our
              understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems and hydrologic systems respond to
              changes in the earth's radiation budget.  However, owing to the variable nature
              of continental processes, few archives of these processes are available,
              especially where the nature of these processes can be retraced at very
              high-resolution time scales which can also be precisely dated.  The speleothem
              deposits of limestone caves represent one such potential repository.  The
              purpose of this research is to investigate the interannual to sub-decadal
              paleoclimatic signals recorded by stalagmites in terms of both spatial and
              temporal variability.  The investigation covers the eastern half of China over
              the past 2000 years.  That such highly resolved time-series paleoclimate
              variability can be effectively read has been encouraged by recent exploratory
              studies which show that a combination of isotopic (18O and 13C) and chemical
              (Mg/Sr/Ca) analyses can help decipher changes in temperature, precipitation and
              vegetation in the past.  Furthermore, these studies reveal a climatic cyclicity
              that may tie to past variations of the summer monsoon strength.  This research
              will contribute to our understanding of not only the climate history of eastern
              Asia, but also the factors influencing the monsoon fluctuations that are rooted
              in the global climate variability.
