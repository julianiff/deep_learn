ABSTRACT

Frequency and
              Structure in Aphasic Language Production: Data 
Base and Experimental
              Studies

	The proposed work will create a data base of English verbs and the
              'frames' they occur in, and start to study whether the properties of those
              verbs can help to explain some of the problems of people with aphasia (language
              impairment after brain damage). 

	Most action verbs occur in frames where
              subject is the agent ('She sang'); for others, the subject undergoes the action
              ('The apple fell'); for others, the role of the subject depends on whether the
              verb is transitive ('He melted the chocolate'), intransitive ('The chocolate
              melted'), or passive ('The chocolate was melted'). To understand a sentence, a
              hearer must understand not only the meanings of the words, but also the roles
              played by the subject noun and any objects of the verb. The data base will list
              the frames for several hundred verbs and the frequency of each frame in spoken
              and written text. 

	People with aphasia have difficulty understanding and/or
              producing spoken and written language. If we understood these disorders, we
              would know more about how the brain stores and processes language, and we might
              also be able to help people with aphasia. The data base will be used in
              designing studies of how people with normal and impaired language understand
              and create sentences.
