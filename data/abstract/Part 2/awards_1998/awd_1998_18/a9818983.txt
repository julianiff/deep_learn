Abstract    :
              This project will analyze oxygen isotopes and alkenone saturation in late
              Pleistocene sediments from ODP cores in the Mediterranean Sea.  The goal is to
              use the temperature relationship of alkenones to define SST values for each
              sample, and then subtract the equivalent value from the isotope data, assuming
              that the residual reflects SSS (Standardized for Ice Valume).  In this way the
              PI hopes to construct surface density maps for times of sapropel formation and
              compare them with non-sapropel-forming intervals, to test the hypothesis that
              sapropels result from a shut-down of vertical circulation caused by an influx
              of fresh water.
