Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a continuation of the SKYFLASH program.  The
              program at present is concerned with three types of investigations, all
              concerned with phenomena in the upper atmosphere and inner magnetosphere, as
              follows:

	Lightning and thunderstorms;
	Aurora Borealis; and
 A third
              category which includes observations of meteors, exploding meteors or
              "bolides", and a continuing search for rare cosmic events in the original sense
              of "SKYFLASH".
