Further investigations of the El Nino Southern Oscillation
              (ENSO) phenomenon
will be conducted. A statistical decomposition into a fixed
              quasi-biennial mode
and a low-frequency mode is proposed to study the observed
              biennial variability
of ENSO and to predict key ENSO variables. The biennial
              decomposition will
also be used to try to improve predictions of rainfall over
              the western equatorial
Pacific and the Indian monsoon rainfall. Second, a
              intermediate coupled ocean-
atmosphere model will be used to understand how
              biennial variability and the
spring persistence barrier are incorporated in
              ENSO.
