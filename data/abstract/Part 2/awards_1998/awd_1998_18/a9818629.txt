The project seeks to describe and explain how and, wherever
              possible, why the grammatical structures of the Chinese language have evolved
              over the past 1,700 years. The description and explanations are based on data
              gleaned from more than 30 vernacular texts. These texts were written over the
              last 1,700 hundred years. They include fantasy stories, popular plays, Buddhist
              sermons, travel memoirs, confessions, and some novels. History, social
              conditions, dialectal variations are also taken into account as critical
              factors in causing grammatical change. The theoretical contribution of the
              project will fall in the area of the mechanisms of grammatical change, i.e. the
              nature and process of grammatical change.
