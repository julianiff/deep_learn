Abstract    :
              


The proposed research is to investigate resonant tunneling injection
              lasers made of GaAs- and InP-based III-V semiconductors emitting at various
              wavelengths from visible to near IR region. The PI has recently made the
              resonant tunneling lasers that showed for the first time direct evidence for
              achieving population inversion through the tunneling injection mechanism at
              77K.  The proposed work is to optimize the device design to maximize the
              tunneling current at room temperature, and to demonstrate a high modulation
              frequency of this device up to 90GHz, compared to 30GHz for the conventional
              quantum well lasers.
