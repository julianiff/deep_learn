This dissertation-enhancement award supports Mark J. Rood's
              graduate student, Christian Carrico, from the University of
              Illinois-Urbana-Champaign to work with Alfred Wiedensohler of the Institute for
              Tropospheric Research in Leipzig, Germany.  The research will focus on
              understanding the role of aerosol particles on global climate.  Specifically,
              the research will address uncertainties in aerosol-climate interactions and
              allow calculation of the effect of aerosols by their channeling of the sun's
              radiant energy.  The dissertation work done here builds on the results of
              NSF-sponsored work.  The collaborative effort will combine light scattering
              measurements done by the U.S. side with distribution, boundary-layer height,
              and light-absorption measurements done by the German side.  The prospects for
              continued collaboration beyond the scope of this project are good, and the work
              is closely related to NSF's emphasis area on environment and global change.
