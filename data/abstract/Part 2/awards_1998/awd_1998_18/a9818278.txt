Abstract    :
              This award is to study experimentally the local heat transfer coefficients
              during transitional boiling using independently controlled heaters.  Most of
              the existing data are for average coefficients over relatively large surfaces. 
              This work will utilize an array of microscale heaters, each smaller than the
              average bubble size, to control local heating and to measure local
              coefficients.  By pinpointing when and where in the vapor departure cycle large
              amounts of heat are removed from the wall and correlating this information to
              visual observations of the state of the fluid at those times, information about
              the important heat transfer mechanisms during transitional boiling will be
              obtained.  This information can also lead to an improved understanding of the
              critical heat flux.  Additional data will be obtained regarding wall void
              fraction, liquid contact duration, and the distribution of liquid contact will
              be secured.  The experimental technique is expected to be applicable to spray
              cooling, impingement cooling, and particle impingement heat transfer.
