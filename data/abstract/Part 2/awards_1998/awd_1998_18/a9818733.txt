To stimulate interest in science, engineering and
              technology, technology courses that address science and technology standards
              are being developed.  This exploratory project is to develop a supplemental
              instructional model on CDROM that presents engineering concepts and
              applications in the area of computers from production of chips to architecture
              issues.  The prototype CDROM includes answers to "how to" questions, computer
              simulation projects, descriptions of hands-on projects and self-administered
              assessments.  It will be tested in classrooms to determine modifications needed
              for successful implementation.
