Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 968-102.  It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 connection to the vBNS.  Applications include
              projects in remote NMR studies, modeling of problems in mathematical sciences,
              data base design, acquisition, modeling and visualization; management of
              primary care at satellite centers, MPEG2 distance leaning technology, and
              static and dynamic physical propoerties of polymers using visualization
              methodology. Collaborating institutions include: NASA-Lewis, OARnet, Ohio
              SuperComputer Center, Texas Tech University, Purdue University, Medina County
              Schools, University of Delaware, University of Wisconsin, Madison and others.
