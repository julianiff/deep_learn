This   project   is   a  contribution  the  the   AIMS  
              (Analysis, Interpretation, Modeling, and Synthesis) phase of the  World  Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In the early part of WOCE, the Deep Basin
              Experiment (DBE) was begun in the tropical South Atlantic.  A variety  of 
              observations were initiated  by  both  US  and  French scientists,  which
              included hydrographic surveys,  mooring  arrays, subsurface floats, and others.
               As part of the effort to synthesize DBE  data,  the  PI proposes to continue
              analysis of  velocity  and temperature measurements from moored arrays at the
              equator along 36 degrees West and in the Romanche and Chain Fracture Zones (RFZ
               and CFZ).  These arrays monitored the two exit passages for  AntArctic
Bottom
              Water (AABW) from the Brazil Basin.  Estimates of mean  AABW transport  and 
              its variability have already been published.  This proposal  addresses the
              transport in potential temperature  classes at  36  degrees W, which will
              estimate the temperature / heat  flux through  the array.  Advective-diffusive
              heat budgets over  volumes bounded  by  isotherms will be used to obtain
              estimates of  average vertical  diffusivity in the AABW in the basins north and
              south  of the  equator, and the implications of slow changes observed in  the
              bottom  water  will  be  studied,  including  the  possibility   of calculating
              time-dependent diffusive coefficients.
