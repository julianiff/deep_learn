Scalable Storage Servers for Advanced Information Systems

This
              research instrumentation enables research projects in:

- Architecture for
              Rapidly Growing Datasets,
- A Scalable Distributed Architecture for Locating
              Heterogeneous Information Sources,
- Data Placement and Information Access,
              and 
- Clustering Support for Parallel Digital Library/Web Servers.

To
              support the aforementioned projects, this award contributes in building an
              instrumentation infrastructure for conducting experimental research on scalable
              storage servers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Computer
              Science Department.  The funds will contribute to the purchase of a cluster of
              quad-processor Workstations, several single processor PCs, a Fast Ethernet
              switch and a Fibervault with a large number of FiberChannel disks.  This
              equipment will be dedicated to support research in databases, operating
              systems, and parallel computing.  The equipment will be used for several
              interrelated research projects, including in particular: evaluation of
              architectures for rapidly growing datasets, design and implementation of a
              scalable distributed architecture for locating information, data placement for
              efficient content-based retrieval and design and implementation of
              cluster-based servers for digital libraries.  Active Disk architectures which
              integrate significant processing power and memory into a disk drive will be
              investigated.  Data placement and information access techniques on active disks
              will be explored.  A scalable distributed architecture for locating
              heterogeneous information sources will be developed on the proposed
              instrumentation infrastructure.  Finally, clustering support for parrallel
              digital library and parallel web servers will be developed.  A common theme
              among the proposed research projects is to provide efficient and scalable
              support for advanced information systems.
