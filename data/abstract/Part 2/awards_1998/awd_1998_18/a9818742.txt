Abstract    :
              	The commitment of citizens to democratic practices under pressure is the
              distinctive objective of the study that we propose.  A celebrated series of
              studies has provided a benchmark view of citizens' support for an array of
              democratic values (Stouffer, 1955; McClosky, 1964; McClosky and Brill, 1983;
              Gibson, 1988; Sullivan et al., 1978, 1982).  Although the coverage of
              democratic values is wide, the examination of the conditions of commitment to
              them remains narrow.  The assessment of attitudes toward political issues
              typically is carried out in conditions that deliberately are studiously
              neutral.  The wording of questions, the framing of alternatives, and even the
              demeanor of the interviewers are designed to eliminate (or at least to balance)
              the pressure on respondents to take one, rather than another, side of a public
              issue (for pioneering exceptions, see Marcus et al., 1995; Gibson, 1998). 
              These studies are valuable but, if the politics of democracies under strain is
              to be grasped, it is necessary to examine the commitments of citizens under
              pressure.  How willing are they to honor their commitments to democratic
              values, not when they weigh their choices in an an artificially neutral
              situation, but when they must make them under pressure?  How ready are they to
              qualify, or even abandon, them when they come face-to-face with competing
              values?  What kinds of pressure - informational, normative, social or
              ideological, impose the greatest strain on the commitment of citizens to
              democratic values?  For whom?  And why?  And with what consequences for the
              practice of democratic politics?
	The study that we propose is designed to
              break new ground in understanding when citizens, in France or elsewhere, stand
              by or forsake democratic principles under the pressure of competing values or
              in the face of an appeal to authority - including the authority of the popular
              will.  To make this possible, we have partnerships with the Centre d'Etude de
              la Vie Politique Francaise (CEVIPOF) in Paris and the Institute d'Etude
              Politiques (CERIP) in Lyon.  Each has a distinctive methodological expertise. 
              The CEVIPOF group has been the leading survey research team in the study of
              electoral politics in France over the last two decades (Boy and Mayer, 1993;
              Boy and Mayer, 1997; Mayer, 1997).  The CERIP group has been the principal
              forum for the study of the politics of ordinary citizens through close
              observation and intensive interviewing.  Our group concentrates on marrying,
              through computer-assisted interviewing, the inferential strength of the
              randomized experiment with the descriptive strength of the representative
              sample.  Working together, we can carry out a study that none of could
              accomplish on our own.
