Abstract    :
              9818027  Block  Control of fungal pathogens in the table and wine grape
              industries has had a large impact on chemical pesticide use in California.  A
              more sustainable form of disease control is the use of biological control
              agents (BCAs) which reduce disease by the controlled introduction of organisms
              to the environment that are natural competitors or inhibitors.  Many fungal and
              bacterial BCAs have been identified for a variety of fungal diseases of
              grapevine.  In particular, the fungus Fusarium lateritium has been found to be
              an alternative to chemical fungicides for prevention of Eutypa Dieback in
              grapevine, a disease caused by infection of pruning wounds with Eutypa lata. 
              In addition, agricultural industries are also facing pressures to reduce
              organic wastes.  This project is to focus on establishing the inoculation of
              BCAs into compost as an effective alternative to spraying.  This method would
              have the dual benefit of recycling agricultural wastes while at the same time
              providing for disease control.  ***
