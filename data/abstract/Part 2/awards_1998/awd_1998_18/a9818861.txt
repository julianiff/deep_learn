The "Materials World Modules (MWM-2002)" employs Internet
              technology to design and deliver customized materials science modules to
              middle- and high-school classrooms.  Building on the previously funded
              Materials World Modules, MWM-2002 promotes inquiry-based materials science
              education by connecting key concepts in science and technology with real world
              applications.  The modules contain design challenges and hands-on activities
              that invite students to create prototype products that people use everyday --
              polymers, ceramics, composites, biodegradable materials, etc.  Teachers order
              modules on-line by choosing from a series of menus that include options for
              class size, reading level, state and local frameworks and existing curricula. 
              Other menus allow the selection of pedagogical strategy, materials science
              content, science process, and technical systems.  Teachers download the
              modules, and the accompanying activity kits are shipped.  Through a website,
              teachers and students have access to a digital library and remote databases on
              materials science.  Students interact with other students, teachers and
              scientists.  Teachers can access resources for professional development
              including distance education workshops, assessment items and exemplary
              classroom practices.  The feedback on the website is used to fine-tune the
              modules and also the functioning of the website.  This project is co-funded by
              the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Interdisiplinary
              Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
