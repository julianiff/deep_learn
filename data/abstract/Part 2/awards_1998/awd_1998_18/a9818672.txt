Abstract    :
              This work will use current meter and hydrographic data from the 
WOCE PCM-1
              array in the northwestern N. Pacific, together with 
sea-level, altimeter, and
              WOCE hydrographic data: 
(a) to analyse the structure and variability of
              Kuroshio volume and 
heat transports, (b) to estimate the meridional heat flux
              in the 
N. Pacific at 24N, (c) to examine the alongstream variation of the
              
Kuroshio by comparing PCM-1 data with data from the PCM-5 mooring 
array,
              further downstream, and (d) to make a comparison with the 
structure and
              variability of Kuroshio transport seen in numerical 
models.
