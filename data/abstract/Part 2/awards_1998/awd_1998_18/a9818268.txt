Title: Arctic
              Shelf and Ocean Paleo-Circulation Modeling Workshop at the Navel Postgraduate
              School, Monterey, CA; April 1999

A critical and largely unexamined component
              of global change is the oceanographic impact of arctic fresh water input and
              changing depth-geometry of straits and shelves fringing the Arctic Ocean.  This
              award supports a  workshop at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, in
              April 1999 to explore the complex effects of eustatic and isostatic changes,
              ice sheet coverage, fresh water input, and variable sea-ice dynamics in the
              Arctic on global ocean circulation during the past 20,000 years.  This venue
              will access recent advances in Arctic Basin oceanographic modeling by the U.S.
              Navy, which provide a rapid means to evaluate many outstanding
              paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic hypotheses.  The workshop will refine
              boundary conditions for the Arctic Ocean, surrounding shelf seas and channels
              for the past 20,000 years, providing new insights for evolving geophysical
              models of the climate system.
