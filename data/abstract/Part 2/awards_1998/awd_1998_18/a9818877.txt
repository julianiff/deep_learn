              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819977  /  OCE-9903393


Investigators from Princeton
              University and the Bermuda Biological Station will synthesize  the inorganic
              carbon data from the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS), the World
              ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and other projects into a comprehensive
              picture of the global inorganic carbon distribution in the surface ocean,
              including anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  Similar attempts have been made in the
              past, but this will be the first time that high-precision carbon system
              measurements will be brought together to permit a realistic modeling of the
              sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide.  The resulting mappings are expected to be
              useful for the development of models of time-varying regional and global
              carbonate system parameters.
