The main goal of this dissertation research project is the
              in-depth analysis and description of the grammar of Tiriyo, a South American
              (Amazonian) language of the Cariban family spoken by approximately 1500 people
              on both sides of the Brazil-Surinam border.  Little descriptive material is
              available on the language.  The dissertation student has already conducted
              preliminary field work on the language.  The dissertation project will allow
              the student to augment the data already collected, and then to produce a
              grammar, collection of texts, and glossary.  The work will be carried out in
              collaboration with local entities:  the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Brazil,
              and the ORSTOM/CNRS in French Guiana.
