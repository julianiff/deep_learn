The Mathematics through Technology and Internet Modules
              project (MTTIM) is in the area of Instructional Materials Development.  Co-PI's
              Douglas A. Grouws and Lucy L. Payne will create six internet-based
              instructional modules and accompanying teacher guides for students in grades
              5-8.  The modules will use internet sites as a source of realistic, current
              data for students to use in classroom activities and investigations.  The
              mathematics focus of the project materials includes exploratory data analysis,
              rates of change, proportional reasoning, and relationships among fractions,
              decimals, and percents.  There will be a project focus on connecting
              mathematics to other disciplines such as science and social studies.  The
              project materials will link to the NCTM Principles and Standards Initiative
              (Standards 2000) and the ISTE Standards.  Connections will also be made with
              existing NSF-supported middle-school curriculum projects as well as other
              widely used middle-school mathematics materials.  These materials are designed
              to supplement existing curricula.  Co-PI's Douglas A. Grouws and Lucy L. Payne.
               NSF support - $774,732; cost sharing - $229,387.
