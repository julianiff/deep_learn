Abstract    :
              	Many transnational issues have been addressed by states, in part through formal
              international organizations; however, little analytical attention in political
              science has been paid to how and when such organizations affect prospects for
              international cooperation.  The proposed research examines state use of
              international secretariats of international organizations to address
              transnational problems.  The research develops hypotheses to explain state use
              of international secretariats, and tests these hypotheses using case studies of
              secretariats drawn from a variety of formal international organizations.  The
              grant supports six weeks of verbal interviews and archival research at the
              secretariats of the United Nations in New York and the World Bank in
              Washington, D.C., beginning June 1, 1999.  During the grant period, the
              researcher collects information on secretariat duties, sources, staffing rules,
              budgets, operations in practice, and methods of state control over secretariat
              work.
