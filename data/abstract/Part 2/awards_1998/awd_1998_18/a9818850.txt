Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary, international research workshop will address how recent
              advances in Geography, including GIS and remote sensing techniques,
              environmental modeling, and regional political ecology, can be integrated in
              future research on African environmental change. The focus will be on
              developing integrative research efforts on African environments utilizing both
              quantitative and qualitative methodologies. By linking new and ever-expanding
              technological capabilities and physical-systems-modeling techniques available
              to geographers with a theoretically informed and practical sensitivity to the
              issues of regional political ecology, better development policies and research
              approaches can be generated at academic, government and grassroots levels.
              Participation includes representatives from US research universities,
              universities in Africa and Europe, and African government environmental
              monitoring institutions. The immediate product of the workshop will be an
              edited volume including the research presentations of the participants. The
              workshop will also generate as many as three separate proposals to the NSF for
              multi-investigator, interdisciplinary research on environmental change and
              environmental protection in Africa.
