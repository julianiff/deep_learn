The project is for a LES study of the effect of horizontal
              shear on turbulent mixing.  The prior DNS results about horizontal shear will
              be generalized to high-Reynolds number oceanic case.  The sub-grid scale model
              will be validated against laboratory data, and a new analytical modeling
              approach will be tested.  The LES approach will also be applied to the tidal
              convergence zone in the Haro Strait.  The research would enhance our
              understanding of oceanic mixing.
