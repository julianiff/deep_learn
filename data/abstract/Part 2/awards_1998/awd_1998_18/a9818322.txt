A
              Laboratory for Interactive Applications of Computational Vision and
              Language

This research instrumentation enables research projects in:
-
              Visual Object Recognition and its Applications to Robotic Aids for the
              Disabled,
- Model-Based Estimation, Tracking, and Recognition for Observing
              Human Activities,
- Evaluating Interactive Systems Based on Natural Language
              Generation, and
- Resolving Ambiguities in Interactive Instructions.

This
              award supports established, on-going research in computer science and
              engineering at Rutgers University and contributes to the purchase of a Minolta
              3-D laser scanner/object modeler, a Nomadics Technologies XR4000 Robotic Arm
              and Stereo Vision Upgrade, a Vision One Video Tracking Platform, four STW
              Linux-based PC's, and a membership in the Linguistic Data Consortium (a source
              of text corpora).  The equipment forms the basis for a new Laboratory for
              Interactive Applications of Computational Vision and Language, directed by the
              four PIs, and will be shared among four collaborative research projects
              spanning the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: (1) the
              integration of object recognition and language understanding in a robotic
              system for the disabled; (2) the development of integrated vision systems that
              combine estimation, tracking, and recognition of both objects and events in a
              model-based framework; (3) the design of a video analysis system for evaluating
              automatically generated instructions; and (4) the development of automatic
              ambiguity resolution procedures for natural language instructions.  In each
              case, the resulting technologies are embedded within human-computer interfaces,
              thereby taking a step toward achieving the goal of more natural interactive
              systems.
