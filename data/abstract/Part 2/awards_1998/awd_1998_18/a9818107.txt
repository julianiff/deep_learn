Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications involve
              remote sensing, water assessment, temperature mapping of Lake Superior, snow
              depth mapping, processing hyperspectral spacecraft data, simulation of internal
              condensing flows; computational analysis of DNA and protein sequences, remote
              modeling of large molecular systems, measurement of volcanic, seismic and
              petroleum data, obtaining /developing crash location, roadsoft and continuous
              sky data. Collaborating institutions include University of Michigan, University
              of South Florida, Unversity of Alaska, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration (NOAA), Air Force Research lab, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
              Michigan Department of Transportation, and the Office of Highway Safety
              Planning.
