Abstract    :
              Gregg 9818693
It is proposed to conduct a large coordinated experiment near the
              Hawaiian 
Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the 
mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways 
for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy
              budget for the region. The 
Survey experiment will address the problem of
              finding a Nearfield site through 
broad ranging and focused survey. In
              particular, this project will quantify the 
geographic variability of shear,
              stratification and kinetic energy dissipation in the 
upper 1500 m around the
              Hawaiian Ridge.
