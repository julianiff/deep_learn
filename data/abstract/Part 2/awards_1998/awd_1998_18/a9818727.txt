This project is a component of the AIMS (Analysis,
              Interpretation, Modeling, and Synthesis) phase of the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE).  The PIs will continue the activities of the WOCE Data
              Assembly Center (DAC) for surface meteorological data and Special Analysis
              Center (SAC) for surface fluxes throughout the AIMS efforts.  These activities
              include: collecting, checking, and distributing underway surface meteorological
              data from WOCE vessels, building an integrated WOCE data resource, adding
              similar but non-WOCE data to expand the capability to reproduce the WOCE
              period, and continue production of specialized monthly mean tropical wind
              products.  Improvements to the FSU surface flux-field system, including a
              statistics approach (cross validation) objective determination of mapping
              tuning parameters should lead to more accurate flux estimates.  Ultimately, a
              surface flux product will be produced via CD-ROM, making the results more
              widely available to the community.
