Abstract    :
              This project focuses on nine pamphlets about religion and science, published
              between 1922 and 1931 by the American Institute of Sacred Literature, a
              correspondence arm of the University of Chicago Divinity School. Shailer
              Mathews, Dean of the Divinity School and an important Protestant theologian,
              supervised the series and wrote one of the pamphlets himself. Another leading
              Protestant theologian, Harry Emerson Fosdick, wrote two pamphlets. The other
              six were written by prominent American scientists and engineers: Robert A.
              Millikan, Edwin Grant Conklin, Kirtley Mather, Edwin Frost, Michael Pupin, and
              Samuel Christian Schmucker. Although the pamphlets were underwritten by John D.
              Rockefeller, Jr., and distributed very widely, they are virtually unknown to
              both historians of science and historians of religion. This project supports
              the preparation of a history of the pamphlets that analyzes their content and
              places them in the larger context of the history of religion and science in
              America.
