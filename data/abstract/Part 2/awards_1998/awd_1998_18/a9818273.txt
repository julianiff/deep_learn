Development of a great river potamocorral and
              applications for determining ecosystem metabolism and community interactions
              among potamoplankton

Large rivers have not been well-studied because of the
              difficulty and hazards associated with sampling. In addition, standard sampling
              techniques used on smaller rivers have not been shown to be effective in
              adequately characterizing these complex and transient systems. This project
              will address the functioning of large river ecosystems. The PIs and their
              undergraduate assistants will construct a set of "potamocorrals" in order to
              perform empirical investigations on the St. Lawrence River. Large-scale, in
              situ field experiments involving large river plankton are currently beyond the
              capabilities of aquatic scientists. These investigators intend to test food web
              and ecosystem metabolism hypotheses that relate to our general theoretical
              understanding of large rivers as heterotrophic systems. Specific experiments
              will consider: 1) the ecological effects of two exotic mussel species on
              plankton food webs; 2) the effects of differing levels of phytoplankton on
              ecosystem metabolism; and 3) the effects of mussel planktivory on the growth of
              planktivorous larval fish. In this latter experiment, the investigators
              hypothesize that dreissenid mussels are a factor in the decline of bass and
              walleye in the St. Lawrence through competitive planktivory.
