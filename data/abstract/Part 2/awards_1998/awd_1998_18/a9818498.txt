Large-scale natural-source
              seismology has provided very little information on the structural or tectonic
              history of the Arctic solid earth.  The Principal Investigators will provide a
              significantly improved seismic model of crust and lithosphere to a minimum of
              150 km below the Arctic seafloor and the surrounding high northern latitudes
              with a lateral resolution of about 400-500 km.  A new seismic model with this
              resolution will: 1) provide a larger scale context to place new and emerging
              information from other sources; 2) fill the void between global and local
              information; 3) complement large-scale gravity and magnetic anomaly maps; and
              4) illuminate a number of questions concerning the structure and tectonics of
              the Arctic.  

Because of the station and earthquake distribution at high
              northern latitudes, the structure of the Arctic crust and lithosphere is best
              explored with surface waves.  This is an excellent time to undertake a surface
              wave tomographic study for four important reasons: 1) Arctic solid earth
              remains is one of the most poorly characterized and understood regions on
              Earth; 2) the number of far northern broadband digital seismic stations has
              grown dramatically over the past several years and most of these data are now
              readily accessible; 3) the methodology to use these data effectively to produce
              new and higher resolution surface wave dispersion maps and models of the Arctic
              is largely in place; and 4) the study builds on the Principal Investigators'
              previous and on-going of surface wave dispersion and crustal and uppermost
              mantle structures beneath Eurasia and other regions of the world.

This
              project will be divided into four parts.  Part 1.  data acquisition,
              processing, clustering, and statistical analyses;  Part 2.  production of
              broadband (20 s - 150s) isotropic Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion maps
              (groups and phase velocity);  Part 3. determination of our ability to estimate
              azimuthal anisotropy in Rayleigh and Love wave phase and group velocity
              dispersion maps; and  Part 4. construction and characterization of a shear
              velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle.  All dispersion measurements
              and maps (isotropic and anisotropic) and the final shear velocity model will be
              available on an Arctic tomography web site.
