Abstract    :
              A one day meeting called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day will be held at
              North Carolina State University (NCSU) in Raleigh on Saturday, April 24,
              l999.

The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance
              understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way
              for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in
              computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily
              accessible way.  This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC
              meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the
              region's graduate students will be particularly encouraged through special
              invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. 
              The meeting will have three invited speakers who have made outstanding
              contributions to the field of computer algebra.  The speakers will anchor the
              meeting and will help attract participants.  The invited talks and poster
              sessions contributed by the community are expected to cover the breadth of
              computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.  The principle theme
              of the l999 meeting will be applications.
