Abstract    :
              9818600

The National Research Council (NRC) will form a committee to convene
              a workshop, which would generate recommendations for agencies on how to
              facilitate and promote access to research resources.  Various federal agencies
              are developing policies to promote the sharing of scientific research
              resources.  This is in response to growing concern that industry and
              universities are pursuing the protection of the intellectual property embodied
              in these resources in ways that are decreasing what has traditionally been
              viewed as a very open exchange and sharing.

The committee will organize a
              workshop to air the various policies of federal agencies.  It will provide an
              opportunity for individuals from the private and public research communities
              react to these policies and discuss their own perspectives and policies.  The
              committee will make recommendations on the following questions:

1. Do
              existing policies promote the sharing of research resources and appropriately
              protect the rights of the owners of these research resources?  In what ways
              could they be modified to further promote these goals?

2. Would greater
              uniformity in these policies further promote their goal?  In what ways should
              these policies be made more uniform?

The study would develop a set of
              recommendations for federal agencies, for-profit research institutions, and
              not-for-profit research institutions focusing on policies aimed at promoting
              the sharing of research resources in the life sciences.
