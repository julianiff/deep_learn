Abstract    :
              
This project will continue a U.S.-Russian collaboration to compile data on the
              pan-Arctic drainage system.  Russian data for the major river systems will be
              made available, digitized, and used in a water balance model.  The project will
              extend current estimates by updating the river discharge, climate, and
              constituent databases to the year 2000.  The modeling effort will extend the
              time horizon to simulate river runoff, river routing, and discharge regimes at
              selected periods from 6000 to 20,000 years ago.  The improved water and
              constitution balances will provide understanding of Eurasian hydrologic and
              material cycles, for understanding the coupling between the Eurasian land and
              shelf, and for understanding Arctic and global circulation.  This project will
              provide the basis for understanding the role of the Arctic hydrologic on global
              freshwater balance.  Changes in the balance are critically important because of
              the large volume (10% of the world's freshwater runoff goes to the Arctic
              Ocean) and its role on sea ice formation which is sensitive to global warming.
