Abstract    :
              The project is to study the possible role of the redundant nuclear envelope
              (RNE) in the calcium-dependent regulation of sperm movement.  This structure is
              found in the headpiece of mammalian sperm and appears to be the excess
              vestments of the nuclear envelope after compaction of the nucleus during sperm
              development.  Although the RNE has been considered by many to be merely a waste
              product, preliminary evidence suggests it is a calcium storage site which
              releases calcium to hyperactivate sperm in the female oviduct.  This idea is
              supported by the close proximity of the envelope to the flagellar base and the
              mitochondrion in the sperm head where the signal for flagellar beating arises. 
              In addition, immunofluorescence light microscopy has revealed that inositol
              triphosphate (IP3) receptors are found in the region of the RNE.  When
              activated, IP3 receptors in other cell systems normally cause release of
              calcium from intracellular stores. Two specific objectives are proposed for
              this project to substantiate this function of the RNE.  As the first objective,
              immunogold electron microscopy will be used to demonstrate unequivocally that
              IP3 receptors are located on the membranes of the RNE.  As the second
              objective, well characterized pharmacological agents will be employed to cause
              intracellular calcium release in order to analyze the role of internal calcium,
              presumably from the RNE, in control of sperm activation.
