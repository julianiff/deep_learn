              ABSTRACT

OCE-9818574

Suboxic mobile mud belts apparently characterize
              large portions of tropical continental shelves and may play a major role in
              global biogeochemical cycling and elemental storage.   In this study,
              investigators from the State University of New York at Stony Brook will
              continue their past work on mobile mud belts off French Guiana downdrift of the
              Amazon River and initiate study with an international team on similar deposits
              on the shelf of Papua New Guinea..  There are three primary objectives:  (1) to
              document, quantify, and model the cycling rates, reaction pathways, material
              source, and sedimentary storage of biogenic debris amd nutrients in the topmost
              2 meters of seafloor; (2) to characterize the associations of benthic
              biological regimes with particular physical/sedimentological settings; and (3)
              to elucidate the authigenic mineral assemblages and biogenic structures
              characterizing these sediments.  This work promises to significantly increase
              our current understanding of the roles played by these tropical sediment
              systems in the cycling of carbon, nutrients, and trace metals.
