This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in control systems involves a group of US and French investigators,
              led by Keqin Gu of Southern Illinois University and Silviu-Iulian Niculescu at
              the Universite de Technologie de Compiegne.  The objective of the research is
              to develop accurate time-delay systems in order to improve system performance
              and reliability of analysis.  They will study problems related to deterministic
              systems, including the extension, combination and simplification of recently
              developed stability and performance theory.  In addition, they will apply
              robust stochastic control design theory and statistical learning methodology to
              time-delay systems.  The results will be implemented as a computer aided
              control systems design package for time-delay systems which could be applied to
              traffic control problems and to remote feedback control for stabilization of
              large-scale power systems.  The collaboration takes advantage of the
              complementary expertise of the US and French investigators.
