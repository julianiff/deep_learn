Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for the above meeting sponsored by the Engineering
              Foundation. The chairpersons are Prof. George Georgiou of the University of
              Texas and Dr. Steven Lee of Merck. This conference series has been instrumental
              in addressing key bioengineering issues involving research and education.
              Biochemical Engineering X, held May 18-23, 1997 in Kananaskis, Canada, was
              attended by 176 attendees from 18 countries, with 60% from industry and the
              rest primarily from academia. It is one of the premier meetings for the
              bioengineering research community. The theme of the 1999 conference is
              "Molecular Diversity in Discovery and Bioprocessing".  Among the key sessions
              are:
Discovery and Production of Bioactive Small Molecules
Discovery and
              Design of Macromolecules
Exploiting Microbial Diversity
Bioinformatics for
              Molecular Diversity
Production of Complex Biologicals
New Analytical Tools
              for Molecular Discovery and Bioprocessing
High Throughput
              Bioprocessing.

The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S.
              researchers to network with foreign scientists in the field, many of whom come
              from countries with extensive bioengineering technology, e.g., Japan.
