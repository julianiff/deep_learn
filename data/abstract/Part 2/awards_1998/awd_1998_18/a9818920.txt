The project is for a study of ocean dynamics and
              thermodynamics along the boundaries of the subtropical gyre in the North
              Pacific.  The observed variability in surface height and temperature will be
              compared with numerical runs using Princeton isopycnal model.  Along the
              northern boundary, the hypothesis is that this is where the mode waters are
              formed, which can carry information from atmospheric forcing into the ocean
              interior.  An isopycnal model with an embedded bulk-mixed-layer will be used to
              investigate where in the water column heat content changes and whether these
              changes could affect SST at a later time. At the southern boundary of the gyre,
              the numerical model will be used to investigate whether this response is due to
              the interaction of the shoaling thermocline with buoyancy forcing in the mixed
              layer.  The objective is to improve both model performance and  interpretation
              of  surface observations.  After confirming model accuracy with observations,
              the model will be used to extend the analysis to longer time scales than are
              available from satellite measurements.
