In this project,   the PIs will   measure and   interpret
              Chlorofluorocarbon  (CFC)  concentrations  during  a hydrographic survey  of
              the Japan/East Sea (JES), which has been funded  by  the Office  of  Naval
              Research.  Two surveys are planned,  one  in  the southern  part  of  the JES
              on the R/V Melville,  and  one  in  the northern part on a Russian vessel.  Due
              to relatively shallow sills and  the  deep interior, much of the JES is
              isolated from  exchange with the adjoining North Pacific.  At depths greater
              than about 500 meters, the very small variations in temperature and salinity 
              make it  difficult to resolve deep circulation and ventilation.   Recent
              preliminary measurements reveal significant amounts of CFCs in  the deep  
              water,  which  suggest  that  more  focused  studies   would contribute
              substantially to understanding the region.
