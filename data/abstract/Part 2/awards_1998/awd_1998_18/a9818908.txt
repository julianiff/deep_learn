Abstract    :
              This project involves an investigation of the role of fluid chemistry,
              mineralogy, temperature and pressure on the rates and processes by which CO2 is
              converted to more stable compounds when exposed to mineral surfaces under
              increasingly reducing conditions.  In general, experiments will be conducted at
              temperatures from 250 to 450 degrees C using a suite of minerals and mineral
              assemblages appropriate for subseafloor hydrothermal systems.  The design of
              experiments emphasize time-series measurements of dissolved carbon species and
              carbon isotopes at experimental conditions and will take full advantage of
              recent advances in theoretical geochemistry to constrain better reactions in
              the C-H-O system. An integrated experimental and theoretical approach is needed
              to understand fully the range and complexity of carbon reduction reactions in
              subseafloor reaction zones at mid-ocean ridges.
