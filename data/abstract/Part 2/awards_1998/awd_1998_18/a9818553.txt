This award is to provide partial support for travel of young
              investigators who will participate in the International Conference on
              Electrical Injury & Safety, Shanghai, China, October 26-28, 1998. The
              University of Chicago is a co-organizer of the event in collaboration with
              Shanghai Power Hospital, Chinese Burn Association, and the U. S. Electric Power
              Research Institute.

Medical and safety professionals, as well as industry
              representatives from China and neighboring countries are to attend the
              conference and share their experiences in the areas of electrical injury
              epidemiology and pathophysiology, advances in diagnosis and treatment,
              psychosocial rehabilitation, and industrial electrical safety practices.  A
              number of world authorities in this field are scheduled as invited
              speakers.

The conference offers a great learning experience for young
              investigators in the multidisciplinary field of electrical trauma.  The
              travelers will be able both to learn from the leading experts and present their
              first research to an international peer group.  The active participation of
              young investigators in this conference is expected to contribute to the future
              success of international cooperation in science, medicine, and industrial and
              environmental safety. The conference proceedings are to be published in the
              Annuals of the New York Academy of Sciences.
