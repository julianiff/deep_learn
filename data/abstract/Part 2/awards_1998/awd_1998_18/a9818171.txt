Abstract    :
              This project consists of a series of interdisciplinary conferences in  applied 
              and computational mathematics conducted by the Society for Industrial and
              Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The conferences are designed to bring together
              mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who are developing and applying new
              mathematical concepts, methods,  and algorithms. A key feature of this series
              is the inclusion of focused, interdisciplinary, academic/industry workshops in
              which mathematical, statistical and computational scientists from academia
              
can interact with mathematicians, statisticians, and computational
              scientists, engineers, and scientists in academia and in industry on specific
              areas and problems of practical interest. The primary objective of the
              conferences is to initiate new interaction among the creators and users of
              mathematics and thereby contribute to the understanding of mathematics and
              encourage its application to problems of society.
