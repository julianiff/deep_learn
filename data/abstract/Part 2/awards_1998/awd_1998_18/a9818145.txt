Abstract    :
              Partial travel support is provided for a group of U.S. researchers to enable
              participation in the International Symposium on Nonlinearity and Stochastic
              Structurtal Dynamics to be held at the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras
              in January of 1999. The symposium is organized by the International Union of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The symposium will focus on stability of
              nonlinear systems and their response to external excitations as well as on
              their behavior in general, including bifurcation and chaos.
