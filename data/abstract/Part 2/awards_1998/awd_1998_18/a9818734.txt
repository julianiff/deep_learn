Abstract    :
              Early indications of climate change in the polar regions can be detected by
              monitoring the surface properties of the polar ice sheets.  Time series of
              ice-sheet surface elevations from satellite radar altimeters can be used to
              study the mass balance of the ice sheets.  Short-term changes in surface
              elevation are caused by seasonal and interannual variations in snow
              accumulation and melting, while longer-term elevation changes are linked to
              climate change and global sea levels.  This proposal requests support to
              document long-term elevation change of the East Antarctic ice sheet using radar
              altimeter data from Seasat, Geosat, and Geosat-Follow On (GFO) satellites.  As
              a direct consequence of this goal, it will also be necessary to quantify
              seasonal and interannual variations in ice-sheet elevation to place the
              long-term measurements in context.  This work is a direct extension of similar
              work done on the Greenland ice sheet and will incorporate methods and
              techniques already proven to produce substantial improvement in measurement
              accuracy.  This work will provide important baseline information that will
              significantly enhance the interpretation of measurements from NASA's Geoscience
              Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) scheduled for launch in 2001.
