This planning project will:

1. Identify an initial set
              of technology tools that represent a range of potential assessment functions
              (e.g., planning, investigating, analyzing and interpreting, communicating and
              presenting, and monitoring, evaluation, reflection and extention.
2. Develop a
              preliminary taxonomy of technology-based tools that indicate the science
              inquiry processes they elicit and the types of assessment information they
              could provide.
3. Illustrate that multiple tools may be combined by designing
              a prototype assessment comprised of three to five science technology tools.
4.
              Plan further efforts towards building a tool kit of technology-supported
              science assessment tools and prototypes.

Products from this project will be:
              

1. A draft conceptual framework.
2. A description of the design
              process.
3. An assessment prototype design of a middle school, inquiry-based
              science investigation that integrates technology tools from several
              sources.
4. Further exploration of the proposed partnerships.
