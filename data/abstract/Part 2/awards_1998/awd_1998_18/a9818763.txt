This award provides funds to support a twelve month research
              visit by Dr. William H. Ruckle, Science Department/Mathematics Unit, American
              University in Cairo, for collaboration with Dr. Kensaku Kikuta, Department of
              Management Science, Kobe University of Commerce, Japan.  The collaborators will
              be engaged in research on the following three topics: (1) Accumulation Games,
              (2) Dynamics of Price Competition and Response Automata, and (3) Dynamics of
              Coalition Formation.  The first topic concerns two person zero sum games while
              the other two topics concern non-zero sum n-person games in which a coalitional
              structure is either not possible or not yet developed.  The method of dealing
              with all three of these topics will be to build a mathematical foundation that
              will support computer calculations and simulations and then to develop such
              calculations.  Drs. Ruckle and Kikuta have collaborated on these topics during
              a four year period and have obtained substantial results, but many interesting
              aspects remain to be investigated.  Solution of these problems will be of
              mutual benefit to U.S. and Japanese mathematicians.
