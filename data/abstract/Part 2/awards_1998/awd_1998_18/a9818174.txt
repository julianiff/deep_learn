Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications include
              projects in studying educational outcomes of networked multimedia,
              networked-based monitoring and fault diagnosis, distributed services
              telemedicine, interconnecting distributed biological databases to establish a
              "virtual computational resource center"; network-based scheduling and supply
              chain coordination and networking controls for network edge multimedia
              appliances. Collaborating institutions include the Jackson Laboratory, the
              Institute of Genomic Research, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence
              Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Brookhaven
              National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the National Human
              Genome Research Institute, the Jefferson Laboratory at the University of
              Virginia and others.
