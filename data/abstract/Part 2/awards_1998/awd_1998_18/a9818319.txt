              Instrumentation:  A Video-Based Testbed For Scientific Visualization
              and
Networking  Research

This research instrumentation enables research
              projects in:
- Video Networking Congestion Management for ATM,
- Video
              Streaming Protocols over ATM and Best-Effort Networks,
- An Image-Based
              Approach to Scientific Visualization, and
- High Performance Video
              Processing.

This award supports established, on-going research in scientific
              visualization, multimedia computing, and low-level networking in the Department
              of Computer and Information Science Department at the Ohio
State University by
              contributing to the acquisition of an SGI server and Octane workstation with
              Digital Video Option, several HP-based workstations, and two ATM switches. 
              This dedicated video-based infrastructure will enable conducting research of a
              more experimental nature in an environment not devoted to the day-to-day
              computing requirements of the department.  The scientific visualization
              research will bring together researchers from the OSU Medical Center and the
              Ohio Supercomputer Center to study advanced scientific visualization techniques
              for medical and high performance computing applications.  This
              diverse
application space will allow the systems support researchers
              (multimedia computing and networking) to have access to new applications that
              require both high bandwidth and stringent end-to-end requirements.
