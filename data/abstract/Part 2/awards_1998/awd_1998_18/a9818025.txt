The enhanced structural performance of buildings and bridges
              strengthened, retrofitted and rehabilitated with advanced composite (carbon or
              glass fiber-based) materials has been well demonstrated and the number of such
              structures is rapidly increasing.  However, poor bonding quality, particularly
              voids, in the adhesive interfaces between the reinforced concrete (RC)
              structure and the composite material can significantly degrade the structural
              integrity that could otherwise be obtainable by the composite material.  In
              order to solve this problem, this research will develop an electromagnetic (EM)
              imaging technology for assessing the bonding condition in the interface between
              concrete and a composite material.  Once the voids are detected, they can be
              corrected by injecting adhesive epoxy at the time when the composite material
              is applied on the structure.

The investigators of this research have
              completed a preliminary study including development of EM image reconstruction
              algorithms and simulation, which not only demonstrated the strong potential of
              the proposed technology in detecting voids in the bonding interface, but also
              established a basis for overcoming the major technical difficulties associated
              with the spatial resolution and speed of assessment in this three-year study. 
              The major research tasks include:  1) development of a prototype EM imaging
              device, 2) further development of the EM imaging reconstruction algorithms, 3)
              verification of the developed EM imaging technology by laboratory testing on
              the bridge columns wrapped with composite jackets with well bonded and poorly
              bonded interfaces, and 4) field tests for the effectiveness of the developed EM
              imaging technology on bridges and buildings strengthened and retrofitted with
              advanced composite materials.
