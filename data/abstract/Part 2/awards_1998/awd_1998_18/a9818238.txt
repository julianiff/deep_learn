Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for further development and implementation of  "virtual
              laboratories".  The goal of this start-up funding is to investigate new
              teaching strategies for effective chemistry instruction and related scientific
              subjects.  Interactive and visual components will be introduced via "virtual
              laboratories" on the WWW.  This project is a continuation of my postdoctoral
              research fellowship under NSF-DGE.  The start-up funding will be used to
              implement and evaluate "virtual laboratories" developed during postdoctoral
              support.  Also, new lessons will be developed and material refined with the
              assistance of student evaluations.

While this grant is aimed at start-up for
              the young faculty PI, it would benefit the whole scientific community at the
              University of Wyoming.  Close collaborations with current faculty and chemical
              educators will allow the developed work to be better implemented on a
              campus-wide scale.  A computer lab will be developed for student evaluation of
              proposed material.  This lab will be supported by the equipment included in
              this proposal as well as by computers supplied by the chemistry department.
