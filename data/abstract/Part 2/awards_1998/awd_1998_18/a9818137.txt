This award supports research that is concerned with
              significantly improving the recognition and definition of buried objects with
              multi-component ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements in three
              dimensional space by utilizing the vector properties of electromagnetic energy,
              which is generally referred to as polarization.  The experiments conducted with
              this support are designed to address the following problems related to GPR
              polarization:  1) determine the nature of the polarized GPR electric field from
              anennas that are designed as linear electric dipoles, 2)develop the basic
              methodology for determining antenna patterns from experimental measurements on
              simple geometric objects (sphere, plane and cylinder), 3) develop  the means to
              measure, process, display and interpret multi-component polarization
              measurements, and 4) establish a library of scattering matrices for some common
              targets.  The testing will be conducted using physical models located at the
              Ohio State University, and a finite difference time domain computer modeling
              software.  Results of these studies will be used to improve the resolution and
              definition of three dimensional displays of GPR data.
