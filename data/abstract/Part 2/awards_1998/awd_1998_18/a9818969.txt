Abstract    :
              A comprehensive documentation and study of 176Hf/177Hf isotope ratio variation
              of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses from the URI dredge rock collection
              will be conducted. The collection focuses on unusually elevated mid-ocean ridge
              segments affected by nearby hotspots and underlying mantle plumes.  About
              300-400 samples from some 300 different sampling localities will be studied.  
              Possible correlations, or decoupling, will be sought between the radiogenic
              Lu-Hf isotope system with that  of Pb, Sr, Nd, and He isotope systems, and
              other geochemical parameters previously established on the very same basalt
              glasses. The study should provide new constraints on the depth and mode of
              melting and extent of garnet  involvement beneath  mid-ocean ridge segments
              affected by hotspots such as Jan Mayen, Iceland, Azores, Sierra Leone, St
              Helena and Tristan da Cuhna in the Atlantic, the Galaggos and Easter in the
              Pacific, and the Afar in the Gulf of Aden-Red Sea region.  Greater insights
              should also be gained on suboceanic mantle geochemistry, length scales of
              heterogeneities, and mantle dynamics.  The study will be done in collaboration
              with Dr. Janne Blichert-Toft and Dr. Francis Albarede, from the Ecole
              Superieure de Lyon, France, where the 176Hf/177Hf ratio measurements will be
              made by plasma source multi-collector mass spectrometry, after Hf has been
              separated at URI.
