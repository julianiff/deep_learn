This project will examine the West Siberian Lowland with both remote
              sensing and field techniques to determine the sensitivity of areas underlain by
              peat to present and past variations in climate.  Data on climate, hydrology,
              and peat will be combined with radiocarbon dates, sediment cores, near-infrared
              and microwave satellite imagery to answer a series of questions.  The age,
              geologic history, and carbon content of the peat will be determined in order to
              examine the role of Arctic peatlands in the sequestration and release of carbon
              during global warming.  The study is very important for understanding the role
              of global change on a large source of carbon that may contribute a natural
              source to the atmosphere if global warming occurs.  The study will also yield
              information about the age of glaciation in the region and the migration and
              distribution of early human culture.
