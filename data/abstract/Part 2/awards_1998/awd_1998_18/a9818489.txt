A
              Gigabit/s, VIA-Enabled Cluster Architecture for Research in High
Performance
              Systems Software, Scalable Knowledge Discovery, Visualization,
and Parallel
              Planning under Uncertainty

This research instrumentation enables research
              projects in:

- Multi-Grain Parallel Processing,
- Scalable Knowledge
              Discovery,
- Parallel Volume Visualization for Computational Field Simulation,
              and
- Parallel Processing for Markov Model Planning.

Concurrency is an
              important enabling technology for several areas of computational science,
              unlocking the potential for new science.  This research instrumentation
              proposal brings together three innovative
computational activities together
              with a fourth research activity that enhances the capability and understanding
              of parallel processing environments, notations, and services.  Six
              investigators at Mississippi
State University, Department of Computer Science,
              undertake the following projects: enhanced infrastructure for multi-grain
              parallel processing (including extensions to MPI, MPI-2, and MPI/RT), scalable
              knowledge
discovery (artificial intelligence plus high performance computing
              to achieve automatic document classification and unsupervised learning
              algorithms), parallel volume visualization for computational field
simulation,
              and parallel processing for Markov Model Planning (study of fast algorithms for
              exact solutions to planning under uncertainty).  To achieve this new science, a
              parallel processing cluster, consisting of thirty, two-way SMP Pentium II
              systems is to be assembled, together with multiple high speed networks, one of
              which supports the Virtual Interface Architecture for low processor overhead
              and high bandwidth.  Commercial-grade message passing software (MPI) and
              scheduling software are used to provide a production environment under Windows
              NT immediately, in complement to the research experiments involving parallel
              processing that further enable the environment over time, including part-time
              Linux-based operation.
