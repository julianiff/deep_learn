Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
              a symposium on novel surfactants to be held in the Division of Colloid and
              Surface Chemistry at the National  American Chemical Society Meeting in New
              Orleans, LA, August 22-26, 1999.  The symposium will bring together junior and
              senior chemists and chemical engineers in the broad area of surfactant
              chemistry.  Participants from the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe will
              take part.
