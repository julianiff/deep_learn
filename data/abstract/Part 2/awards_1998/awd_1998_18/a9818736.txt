The Education Development Center (EDC) is developing a
              collection of research projects that will allow typical high school students to
              engage in a mathematical research experience, involving problems appropriate to
              their mathematical backgrounds.  While these projects may not contain original
              research, they embody a true research experience in that students begin with a
              problem, build a model, conduct experiments, make conjectures, and work towards
              a deductive proof as a final goal.  EDC is producing a resource book of
              projects, a companion guide for teachers, a book of cases describing student
              research in mathematics, and a website where students can interact with each
              other and with expert mentors.  Mentors are identified through contacts with
              professional mathematics societies and with a number of college and university
              mathematics departments.
