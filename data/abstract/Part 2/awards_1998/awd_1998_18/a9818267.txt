Title: IDEAL
              Planning and Logistics 

This award supports paleoclimate activities within
              the International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL), specifically for
              meetings of the North American Steering Committee of IDEAL, organizing
              paleoclimate workshops, and interfacing the needs and activities of the
              American paleoclimate program in IDEAL with those of the European and African
              scientists.  Funding also will be used to address specific logistics needs,
              including the acquisition of permits and maintenance of communication with
              African government officials, scientists and students.
