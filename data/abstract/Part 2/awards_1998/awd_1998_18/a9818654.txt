              ABSTRACT

OCE-9818654

The principal investigator will consider the question
              of why dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in seawater are nearly
              invariable worldwide.  His recent studies indicate that DOC recovered by
              ultrafiltration is constituted by a well-defined set of acylated
              polysaccharides  (sugar polymers), which appear to be of algal origin and to be
              ubiquitous in seawater.  Now, the PI will continue a detailed study of the
              structure and composition of these polysaccharides in the >500 Dalton size
              fraction of seawater.  Additionally, radiocarbon assays will  be used to study
              their removal from the surface ocean by macroaggregates and their transport to
              the deep ocean.  Major portions of the field work will be carried out through
              participation on funded cruises of other NSF investigators at the University of
              California at Irvine and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who are
              currently studying DOC cycling in the deep ocean.
