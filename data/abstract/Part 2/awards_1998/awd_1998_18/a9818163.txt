Abstract    :
              
Funds are provided to purchase and develop a towed electromagnetic (EM) survey
              system which determines the porosity structure of the upper sediment column
              (1-20m below seafloor) across the continental shelf and slope. Such a device
              builds upon a similar, but unique system developed in Canada that was
              successfully used to identify regions of shallow gas and/or fresh water seeps.
              The method is able to provide quantitative estimates of sedimentary porosities
              over much larger areas than any other technique that currently exists. Towed EM
              instruments are the only tools able to provide quantitative estimates of
              porosity in noncohesive sediments. Combining EM data with more conventional
              geophysical measurements allows investigators to understand how porosity and
              permeability of sediments evolve through time.

The EM survey system will be
              used in a multi-disciplinary manner to determine processes which shape the
              formation and evolution of the continental shelf, the critical boundary between
              continent and deep ocean. In particular they directly address issues of
              understanding process and product in shallow waters, identified as a key
              research area by the MARGINS initiative.
