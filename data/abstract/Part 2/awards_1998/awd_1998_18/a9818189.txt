Abstract    :
              One common mechanism for acquisition of new traits in bacteria is by the
              transmission of DNA between a donor and a recipient cell via conjugation. This
              project will characterize the activities of a protein, TraD, essential for
              conjugation of the well-characterized F (fertility) plasmid of Escherichia
              coli. TraD is a member of a conserved and broadly distributed family of
              cytoplasmic membrane proteins that act during the DNA transfer step of
              conjugation. Preliminary studies have suggested that TraD is a DNA-dependent
              ATPase, possibly involved in energizing DNA transfer through a
              conjugation-specific pore in the cell envelope. In addition, TraD probably
              interacts with two other transfer (Tra) proteins necessary for DNA processing
              during conjugation, the cytoplasmic TraI (oriT nickase and DNA helicase) and
              TraM proteins. This work will characterize wild type and mutant forms of TraD
              in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, focusing on characterizing the
              enzymatic parameters of the TraD ATPase activity and determining its
              requirement in conjugation; defining interactions between TraD and TraM/TraI;
              and probing contacts between extra-cytoplasmic domains of TraD and other cell
              envelope proteins required to signal the initiation of DNA metabolism.  TraD
              homologues are expressed by other conjugal plasmids, thus the study of the F
              plasmid TraD protein may have profound implications for understanding the
              transfer of genetic information via conjugation among a wide variety of
              bacterial genera.
