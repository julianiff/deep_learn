Title: Evaluation of
              Snow Simulation in the Second Phase of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
              Project (AMIP-II)

The overall goal of this project is to evaluate
              simulations of snow covered area and snow mass in General Circulation Models
              (GCM) submitted under the auspices of the second phase of the Atmospheric Model
              Intercomparison Project (AMIP-II).  AMIP is an international effort to
              determine the systematic errors in atmospheric climate models.  Three main
              objectives are identified to evaluate AMIP-II snow simulations.  These are: (1)
              evaluation of snow covered area (SCA) climatology and kinematics; (2)
              evaluation of snow mass climatologies; and (3) evaluation of atmospheric
              circulation patterns associated with snow.  Snow is an important modulator of
              surface energy fluxes, and one of the largest seasonally varying surface
              parameters over the Northern Hemisphere.  These investigations will help
              modelers evaluate their treatment of snow, from the perspectives of both
              atmospheric dynamics as well as surface parameterizations.  By identifying
              regions, models, and model characteristics with biased snow simulations, this
              research will aid modelers in their diagnoses of surface fluxes, an important
              physical process relevant to climate prediction.
