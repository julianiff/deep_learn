              ABSTRACT

OCE-9818530

Although it is well known that the supply and
              transformation of nitrogen from one form to another are major determinants of
              biological productivity in the marine environment, we still know very little
              about the processes involved in the transformation of nitrogen from organic to
              inorganic form.  To approach this problem, scientists from the State University
              of New York at Stony Brook will study the cycling of amino acids, peptides, and
              proteins in two inshore marine environments, Long Island Sound and Chesapeake
              Bay.  The specific goals are to determine the environmental conditions under
              which hydrolysis of peptides and proteins occurs, whether hydrolysis is the
              rate-limiting step in amino acid uptake, and the sources of exoenzymatic
              activity in seawater.  Proteolytic activity, cell-surface oxidation, and amino
              acid uptake would be measured under various environmental conditions to
              determine how they are affected by differences in biomass,  community
              structure, and amount of dissolved organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen. 
              The Chesapeake Bay field studies would be carried out cooperatively with
              scientists from the Horn Point Environmental Laboratory which is situated on
              the Bay.
