The Education Development Center in Newton, MA is
              developing a searchable and well-indexed collection of problems and
              orchestrated problem sets designed to help students in grades 6-12 develop both
              deep conceptual mathematical understandings and technical skills.  Accessible
              to teachers, students, and parents over the Web, this resource includes
              problems and problem sets for development, practice, assessment, and
              integration of concepts and skills.  The problems are classified by topic,
              difficulty level, and use of technology, and keyed to existing and newly
              published, reform-minded, middle school and high school curricula.  The website
              also supports a moderated electronic forum for discussion on the mathematics in
              the problems and related issues, and for the contribution of new problems.  A
              research component provides insight into teachers' uses and needs related to
              implementation of reform curricula.
