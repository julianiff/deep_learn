Abstract    :
              In 1989, The Decade of the Brain was declared for 1990-1999 by a Congressional
              Resolution signed by President Bush.  The Society for Neuroscience, a
              scientific organization now with more than 28,000 members, played an integral
              role in this legislation.  The Society is presenting this Symposium to
              emphasize the accomplishments of this decade and look toward the future for the
              brain research the 21st Century.  Eminent neuroscientists, public officials,
              members of advocacy and educational groups and media representatives will come
              together to consider an overview of progress in understanding the nervous
              system.  There will be an emphasis on new technical and conceptual approaches
              to understanding the nervous system; on contributions of molecular, cellular,
              systems and behavioral biology to understanding brain dysfunction; and on
              perceptual function and developmental plasticity of the human brain.

This
              Symposium is likely to have a high positive impact on public and congressional
              awareness of basic neuroscience research, and so serves as major outreach
              activity as well as an update on scientific issues.
