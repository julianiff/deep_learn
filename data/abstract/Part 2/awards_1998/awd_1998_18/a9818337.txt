The project is for a modeling study of circulation around
              islands in a low stratified ocean.  The focuses are on what determines the mean
              and low-frequency variability, and the extent to which islands inhibit
              communication between basins.  Idealized and more realistic numerical models
              will be used in conjunction with theoretical studies, laboratory experiments,
              and data analysis.
