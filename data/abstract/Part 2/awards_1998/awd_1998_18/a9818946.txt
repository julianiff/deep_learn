The University of Massachusetts, Amherst is developing a new
              type of data analysis software tool, "Tinker Plots," for instructional use in
              data analysis and statistics in middle schools.  Tinker Plots offers a
              construction set rather than a menu of ready-made graph types and helps orient
              students and teachers to the inquiry-driven nature of data analysis.  The
              development of Tinker Plots is done in collaboration with teams that developed
              comprehensive instructional materials for middle school mathematics.  
              Revisions of some units of these instructional materials are being done in
              order to support the classroom testing of the software.
