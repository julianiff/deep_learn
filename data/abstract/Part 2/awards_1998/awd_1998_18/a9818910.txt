The project is for a laboratory study of breaking waves.  The
              breaker will be generated by side-bank instability technique.  The goal is to
              understand the dynamics of breaking waves, and to assess effects of breaker
              wavelength, surfactants and wind on the sub-surface flow fields.  Three areas
              of inquiry are proposed:  (1)  study the breaking mechanism over a wide range
              of breaker wavelenghts; (2)  study effects of surfactants on breaking waves;
              (3) study effects of wind on breakers.
