              Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are important atmospheric motions related to the
              transport of contaminant materials.  These motions are quite difficult to
              measure in the natural environment and laboratory measurements may be able to
              contribute to an enhanced understanding of these complex flows.  The present
              grant is to provide a focussed one year effort in which the suitability of a
              NSF sponsored facility can provide data to determine the potential contribution
              of such laboratory studies.
