This U.S.-Brazil award will support a planning visit by Drs.
              Minion K. C. Morrison and David Covin of the University of Missouri, to go to
              Bahia, Brazil to meet with Dr. Luiza Bairros at the Universidade Federal da
              Bahia.
Through this visit, a proposal will be developed for the organization
              of a workshop that will enable political and social scientists from the U.S.
              and Brazil to do comparative studies on the politics of race in the Western
              Hemisphere. The planned workshop will bring together members of the National
              Conference of Black Political Scientists (NCOBPS) and colleagues from Brazil
              who are interested in long-term, cross-national studies of race, using
              Afro-North Americans and Afro-Brazilians as the principal focus points.  The
              organizers of this project believe that race plays a significant role in the
              public's opinion, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, and
              they will study it as it plays out in the political arena.
