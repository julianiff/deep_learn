During insect metamorphosis, juvenile hormone regulates
              changes in gene expression that are necessary for properly executed changes in
              insect body form.  This research will analyze the transcription factors
              operating at a metamorphosis-associated gene that transduce the juvenile
              hormone regulatory signals.  These proteins will be purified and their ligand
              binding properties assessed by fluorescence ligand-binding techniques. 
              Analysis of their ligand-binding and transactivation properties in the in vitro
              transcription assays will provide important information on the molecular
              mechanisms by which juvenile hormone regulates expression of this, and possibly
              other, genes associated with metamorphosis.
