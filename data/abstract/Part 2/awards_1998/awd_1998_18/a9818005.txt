Title:
              Climate Record from Corals in the Central and Western Sectors of the Tropical
              South Pacific

The tropical South Pacific region has only been sparsely
              sampled for annually resolved paleoclimatic records of the last several
              centuries.  Historical records of climate in this region are also relatively
              sparse.  This region is however dramatically effected by the interannual El
              Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, and possibly by decadal-scale
              ocean-atmosphere variability.  This award supports the analysis of multicentury
              coral cores from Fiji and Rarotonga in the western and central sectors of the
              South Pacific.  Both sites are positioned near the southern edge of the Pacific
              warm pool within the westward flowing South Equatorial Current, and in the
              region of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ).  This project will
              isotopically analyze the upper 150 years of coral record from both sites to
              examine ENSO-band and decadal variability in these South Pacific gyre
              locations.
