Information Processing in the Avian Visual System


The visual
              system is one of our most important sensory systems.  A powerful methodology to
              determine how the visual system functions is to use the comparative approach;
              i.e., to study the visual system in different animals.  As in all vertebrates,
              the avian visual system consists of two principal pathways: the thalamofugal
              pathway and the 
tectofugal pathway.  The proposed research will use
              sophisticated methods of visual analysis (the contrast sensitivity function)
              and selective lesions in the visual thalamus to determine the extent to which
              the thalamofugal pathway processes spatial information. 
Previous studies with
              weaker methods have not revealed deficits in spatial vision after lesions of
              this pathway. The tectofugal pathway, terminates in the medial and lateral
              regions of the ectostriatum, a region of the telencephalon.   The experiments
              will use stimuli that differ in their spatiotemporal properties to determine
              whether the medial and lateral regions of ectostriatum are functionally
              distinct regions.

A dictum of the comparative method is that if one wants to
              know how a system works, study it in a specialist.  The two major visual
              specialists among the vertebrates are primates and birds.  Because birds and
              primates are not closely related, their most recent common ancestor being among
              the early reptiles, these two groups have developed their exquisite visual
              systems relatively independently, but most likely by a common mechanism. 
              Whatever information can be gained from the study of the avian visual system
              will add to our understanding of the general  mechanisms by which visual
              systems 
evolved among vertebrates.
