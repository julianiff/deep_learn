ABSTRACT

Public involvement in government
              decision-making is a basic aspect of  modern democracy, and yet there has been
              very little empirical analysis of what contributes to successful citizen
              involvement.  This project employs explicit criteria of success to analyze a
              large number of cases (more than 250) of public participation in environmental
              decisions.  A number of different types of public involvement mechanisms are
              being studied, including public hearings, citizen advisory committees,
              mediations, surveys, focus groups, public education programs, and citizen
              panels.  The results of the analysis are expected to provide better
              understanding of what factors contribute to successful participation and what
              mechanisms work best in particular circumstances.
