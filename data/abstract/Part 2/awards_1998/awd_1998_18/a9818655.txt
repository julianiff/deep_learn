Abstract    :
              Stereotypes are believed to exist only when there is a socially meaningful
              categorical distinction between two or more classes of persons, such as
              different racial groups. The experiments supported by this planning grant test
              the hypothesis that light and dark skin tone represent distinct subcategories
              of black persons. Fictional works and historical accounts suggest that skin
              tone plays an important role in the black American community. In addition,
              these sources strongly suggest the existence of stereotypes about skin tone
              that bias one's perceptions of blacks. Although many researchers have measured
              beliefs about skin tone, or examined the proposed consequences of skin tone
              bias, few have tried to understand the causal role of skin tone in this
              phenomenon.

The planning activities for this research will take place in
              three phases. The first phase involves the collection of photographs of blacks
              and digital alteration of the skin tone of the persons pictured. The second
              phase involves preliminary testing of the photographs and two experiments using
              a group discussion paradigm. The third and final phase will involve analyses of
              the data collected from the experiments, interpretation of the results,
              dissemination of the findings at professional conferences, and discussion of
              the findings with colleagues.
