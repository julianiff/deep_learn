Abstract    :
              The PI will measure HF induced ionospheric Langmuir turbulence at high
              resolution Arecibo and EISCAT enhanced plasma line spectra, hoping to locate
              the cascade spectrum relative to matching and reflection heights during daytime
              experiments.  He will perform low HF duty cycle experiments with increased HF
              power to investigate the effects of increased power on the free mode physics,
              as well as experiments observing the effect of magnetic field geometry on
              observations of the normal HF-induced plasma line, and on HF enhanced
              outshifted plasma line.  Moreover, he will perform nighttime observations
              during low HF duty cycle heating using the 'chirp' technique to better compare
              daytime results with nighttime coded long pulse experiments.  Finally, time
              permitting, he will vary the HF duty cycle to measure HF irregularity-induced
              broadening of the natural plasma line at Arecibo and EISCAT.
