The Neural Information and Coding Workshop
              (NIC) is a small (-60 people), intensive, three-day meeting devoted to the
              neural code.  The objectives are two-fold: to bring together experimental and
              theoretical neuroscientists to share new ideas and results, and to discuss how
              new experimental and theoretical approaches can be combined to better
              understand neural coding.

Three kinds of participants are included:  1)
              experimentalists working on various aspects of this problem (although this
              group is growing rapidly, it is not yet a community, so relevant advances can
              go unnoticed without a forum for presentation); 2) experimentalists who are
              developing new technologies, such as optical imaging and multi-unit recording,
              that will be necessary for further progress; 3) theoreticians, since we do not
              currently have a unified frame work for thinking about the neural code.
