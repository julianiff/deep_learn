              Instrumentation:  Distributed Reconfigurable Robot Systems

This research
              instrumentation enables research projects in:

- Self-Reconfiguring
              Robotics
- Distributed Manipulation with MEMS Devices
- Distributed Control
              for Massively Parallel Reconfiguring Robot Systems, and 
- Self-Reconfiguring
              MEMS Robots

This award supports on-going research in the Department of
              Computer Science at Dartmouth College and contributes to simulation facilities
              (for design and control) and physical hardware (for robotics experiments). The
              Department will purchase computing and fabrication equipment which will be
              dedicated to support the aforementioned projects:  Stratasys system,
              workstations, MotionStar motion capture system, etc.  The goal of this research
              project is to build self-reconfiguring robotics systems at the mini and MEMS
              scale, and to develop a science-based for planning and controlling highly
              distributed reconfigurable robot systems.  Mini and MEMS self-configuring
              robots that employ the principles of self-organization and self-assembly to
              combine structure with function will be designed and built.  The equipment will
              be used for the research mentioned, including in particular: (1) developing
              self-configuring mini-robot systems; (2) developing massively parallel control
              algorithms for MEMS devices; (3) developing novel algorithms for distributed
              control of massively parallel reconfiguring robot systems; and (4) combining
              the results on massively-parallel micro-fabricated MEMS actuators and
              self-reconfiguring systems to design, fabricate, control and program
              self-reconfiguring micro-robot systems, built using MEMS technology.  These
              advances in reconfigurable robotics science will greatly enhance the
              capabilities of distributed robot systems.
