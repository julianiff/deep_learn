A Low-Cost, High Performance Computing Platform

This research
              instrumentation enables research projects in:
- Efficient Communication and
              Scheduling Support for a Network of Workstations,
- High Performance
              Geographical Information Systems,
- High Performance Scientific Calculations
              Based on Unstructured Mesh Discretizations, and
- Application Communication
              Characterization.

To support the aforementioned projects, this award
              contributes to the purchase of Pentium machines and Myrinet hardware to set up
              a cost-effective Network of Workstations (NOW) platform which will
              be
dedicated to support research in computer and information science and
              engineering by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
              Pennsylvania State University.  The experimental platform will be used for
              several research projects, including in particular, the four cited above.  The
              first project focuses on deriving efficient software mechanisms for
              communication and scheduling for parallel applications.  The second
              interdisciplinary research project plans to develop a High Performance Temporal
              Geographical Information System (GIS) on the NOW platform.  The third project
              proposes to use this platform for developing efficient algorithms for
              unstructured mesh computations.  The last project aims at characterizing the
              communication behavior of many applications.
