Abstract    :
              This project, carried out by Professor Richard Crooks at Texas A&M University,
              and funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, involves the
              design, synthesis, characterization, and surface immobilization of new organic
              materials intended to serve as chemically sensitive devices in array-based
              sensors.  The organic materials that are the focus of this proposal are
              hyberbranched polymer films and dendritic polymers.  Vapor phase chemical
              sensors based on dendritic monolayers are characterized by surface acoustic
              wave mass balances.  The chemical sensitivities of the immobilized films are
              correlated with the physical properties and intended design of the dendritic
              structure, and an iteration to achieve the desired chemical selectivity will be
              pursued.  Use of these thin films in arrays for volatile organic compound
              determinations will be explored in collaborative efforts.  A combinatorial
              chemistry approach to the preparation of new organic compounds to be used for
              sensing is explored, and a novel means for bilayer film immobilization that
              preserves selectivity and protects the surface from poisoning is also
              pursued.

The usefulness of chemical sensors depends on the specificity of
              the material on the surface of the sensor.  This work by Professor Richard
              Crooks of Texas A&M University develops new highly branched materials with
              predictable specificities and better responses.  A means to connect the
              material to the sensor surface that protects the sensing film from damage and
              poisoning is also being developed.
