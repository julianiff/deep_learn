Abstract    :
              This project will analyze stable isotopes and taxonomic assemblages of planktic
              foraminifera, and mineralogy of colian particles, in a north-south transect of
              cores along the Canary Current and the West African upwelling zone. 
              Preliminary daa from a site off West Africa indicate the existence of a
              1500-year thermal cycle during the Holocene, similar to a cycle identified in
              the subpolar North Atlantic.  The study will explore the spatial extent of
              subtropical cooling events in the Holocene and attempt to determine whether
              they result from larger-scale changes in eastern boundary currents or local
              changes in West African upwelling.
