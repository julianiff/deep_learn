This four-year implementation site project will:  (1)
              increase the number of communities knowledgeable about NSF-supported exemplary
              K-12 science curricula; (2) establish networks among educators in these and
              other communities; (3) establish regional support centers (nodes) that will
              continue to provide support to communities beyond project funding; and (4), 
              collaborate with publishers of NSF-supported curricula to develop new
              strategies for supporting school district curriculum implementation.  A focus
              will be on underserved communities in both urban and rural
              areas.

Specifically, the project has:  (1) identified a national faculty to
              work with EDC and the nodes; (2) attained the support of eight publishers; (3)
              identified ten nodes -- Fayette County Public Schools, Lexington, KY; Jackson
              Public Schools, Jackson, MS; Portland Public Schools, Portland, OR; Pueblo
              School District 60, Pueblo, CO; South Bend Schools Corporation/Notre Dame
              University, South Bend, IN; The Keystone Project, Bozeman, MT; The Center for
              Excellence for Mathematics and Science Education at Black Hill University,
              Spearfish, SD; The Area Education Association, Clear Lake, IA; Upper Peninsula
              of Michigan Mathematics and Science Consortium; the University of Idaho,
              Moscow, ID; and the Panhandle Area Education Consortium, Chipley, FL.  Each
              node has a group of collaborators that include the Eisenhower Regional
              Consortia, local universities, museums, businesses, and other science-rich
              organizations.  Over four years, the nodes will serve 375-500
              communities.

EDC will provide each node with core activities including
              materials libraries, summer institutions, resource and product development and
              electronic communication.

The evaluation will be conducted by Policy Studies
              Associates and will examine district participation (criteria for underserved),
              adoption of NSF-funded curricula, evidence of sound implementation, and quality
              of EDC activities.
