Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the role of local government redevelopment
              agencies in planning and financing reconstruction after earthquakes. 
              Redevelopment is a process used by local governments to plan, develop,
              redesign, clear, reconstruct or rehabilitate urban areas deemed blighted for
              many reasons, which may include the impacts of disaster.  The study will
              consist of fifteen structured case studies of the use of redevelopment
              following past earthquakes.  Sources of data for the study will include
              existing accounts and interviews with local officials.  Information from the
              case studies will be assembled in matrices to allow for comparisons among the
              cases.  The study will also explore how redevelopment has been used after other
              disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in order to capture lessons
              applicable to post-earthquake reconstruction and assess the usefulness of the
              approach in rebuilding after other disasters.
