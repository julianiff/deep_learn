Abstract    :
              This proposed work concerns the continued operation of the Polar Experiment
              Network for Upper-atmosphere Investigations (PENGUIn) in Antarctica.  The
              network consists of six automatic geophysical observatories located in the
              antarctic interior, that make measurements of ionospheric and magnetospheric
              processes that result from the effects of the sun.  They are located along two
              meridional lines approximately 1.6 hours apart in magnetic local time. 
              Although data is collected year-round, the data is retrieved by visiting each
              station during the austral summer season.  The British Antarctic Survey and the
              Australian Antarctic Program operate several similar observatories and
              cooperate in the data management and analysis.
	
The instruments in each
              observatory include optical and radio wave imagers, magnetometers, and
              wide-band and narrow-band radio receivers.  The network supports an active
              research program in the coupling of the solar wind to ionospheric and
              magnetospheric processes, emphasizing polar cap dynamics, substorm phenomena,
              and space weather.  Nine institutions are directly involved in acquiring the
              data, carrying out the proposed research, and making the data available for
              further use by other scientists.
