	This project funds the dissertation research of an
              anthropology student from Stanford University, studying an Indian national
              program of rural women's development through empowerment.  Using a combination
              of documentary analysis and ethnographic methods such as participant
              observation, interviews as well as surveys, the student will evaluate the
              intended as well as the unintended effects of the government's
              conceptualization of "development", "empowerment" and "modernity" on the lives
              of poor, rural women.  The site of the study is the state of Uttar Pradesh,
              where a Gender and Development program has been praised for its flexible
              approach, organization and exemplary goals because it seeks to empower women to
              develop themselves.  The design of the study is a controlled comparison of two
              matched villages similar in as many respects as possible except that in one the
              program is operating and in the other it is not.  The student will interview
              officials to understand their goals, practices and strategy and will survey
              women in both villages about background variables, relationships and desires
              for their lives. The concept of empowerment will be analyzed through six
              domains, political participation, legal decision making, household and
              community activity, control over economic resources, access to public
              resources, and collective organizing.  This case study will provide a valuable
              advance in our understanding of the new approach to economic development which
              focuses on empowering women, as well as contribute to the training of a young
              social scientist and advance our understanding of this important region of the
              world.
