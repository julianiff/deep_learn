This proposal will fund  travel, subsistence expenses,
              publications and other administrative expenses for 14 undergraduate students to
              participate in a research oriented tropical biology program to take place at
              the Organization of Tropical Studies, (OTS), Costa Rica, under the auspices of
              Duke University.  The award, that  will fund approximately a third of the total
              participants, will allow undergraduate students from economically disadvantaged
              and underrepresented populations to participate in the project.  They will be
              interacting with senior scientists and researchers, and will be exposed to
              hands-on learning in field-oriented research.  This will allow the students the
              opportunity to be introduced to a diversity of tropical habitats, both natural
              and disturbed, the scientific principles that guide current research in
              tropical ecology, a variety of research techniques, and the representative
              environmental challenges facing developing tropical nations.  Costa Rica is an
              ideal place for this activity because of the astonishing richness of ecosystems
              and biodiversity.  
 
The goal of this activity is to improve the number and
              diversity of undergraduate students being provided with a quality tropical
              biology experience. Support from NSF will be an instrumental component in the
              effort to attract promising students to tropical ecology and to become familiar
              with development and conservation issues in the international arena.
