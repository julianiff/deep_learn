Abstract    :
              	This project represents a collaboration between Dr. Emanuel and Dr. Bishop of
              Penn State University who is funded under ATM-9814376.

	The project will
              expand work undertaken by the principal investigators on adaptive sampling of
              the atmosphere.   Heretofore, routine in-situ observations of the atmosphere
              have been made either from fixed locations at fixed times (e.g., by
              instrumented weather balloons) or from platforms of opportunity such as ships
              and commercial aircraft.  Adaptive sampling uses information about the current
              and (estimated) future state of the atmosphere, such as estimates of the
              distribution of analysis uncertainty and forecast sensitivity, to determine
              locations where observations would lead to the greatest improvements in
              forecasts.  Programmable observation platforms, such as manned or unmanned
              aircraft, are then directed to these special locations to make the
              observations.  The principal investigators' work to data has developed,
              refined, and tested several adaptive sampling strategies.  They will continue
              with these studies and extending to the problem of hurricane track prediction,
              one of the most important forecasting problems facing us today.  A key
              component of this study will be the exploration of data assimilation and its
              role in optimally employing these new observations in the weather analyses.  In
              particular, Drs. Bishop and Emanuel will be looking at the use of ensembles for
              the assimilation process and comparing this approach with current techniques. 
              In the course of this work, the principal investigators will employ a hierarchy
              of models.
