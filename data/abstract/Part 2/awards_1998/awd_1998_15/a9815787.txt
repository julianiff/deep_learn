Our planet is currently experiencing an alarming rate of
              species disappearance, commonly referred to as the 'Biodiversity Crisis.'  An
              example of this is the observance of decline in frog population density around
              the world, and hence the increased possibility of species extinction.   It is
              urgent that biologists understand why this is happening.  To address this we
              must first know how many species are living currently.  Furthermore, we must
              assess the historical relationships among existing species if we are to
              understand the factors contributing to their origin and current
              distributions.

The present proposal is to decipher relationships in a large
              group of South and Central American frogs, the genus Leptodactylus.  This group
              of frogs includes about 70 species in four lineages.  We know the four lineages
              were already present and differentiated from each other about 65-70 million
              years ago, but we do not know the relationships within or among the groups. 
              These frogs exhibit an array of different reproductive strategies that
              undoubtedly has contributed to their success and survival over the last several
              million years.  Deciphering the relationships among these frogs represents the
              first step to understanding the history of their reproductive strategies.

We
              will use a variety of molecular techniques with the purpose of collecting
              genetic data (DNA sequences) to assess relationships.  The genetic data will be
              integrated with previously available and newly gathered morphological data. 
              The project is designed to give undergraduate science students the opportunity
              to learn molecular techniques, morphological methodologies, and statistical
              models within a participatory creative process of scientific inquiry.
