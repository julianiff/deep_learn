The prediction of thermodynamic properties, such as
              atomization energies and ionization potentials, has long been a goal of quantum
              chemists.  A number of methods have been developed, but each has drawbacks. 
              One of the serious drawbacks is that the existing methods (G2 method and its
              variants) do not work for a large section of chemistry, including transition
              states for most chemical reactions.  The primary goal of this cooperative
              research project is to develop an analog to the existing methods that is
              designed to provide a level of accuracy that is comparable to the existing
              methods.  Funds are provided for Professor Gordon and one graduate student to
              visit the laboratory of Professor Leo Radom, Australian National University,
              during early in the project in order to optimize the development process and
              for a second visit during the testing process.
