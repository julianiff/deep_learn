Rothschild
This award supports the PI, Richard Rothschild, two
              postdoctoral students and two graduate students of the University of Florida in
              a collaboration with Rudiger Staubert of the Institute for Astronomy at the
              University of Tuebingen, Germany.  The research focus is on the analysis and
              interpretation of X-ray data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The
              U.S. team has a strong knowledge of the strengths and limitations of the data
              obtained from RXTE and the German team is strong in the development and use of
              advanced interpretive tools.  Together, the two teams are in a unique position
              to use the raw X-ray data to answer current astrophysical questions. 
              Specifically, the two groups will improve our understanding of processes
              associated with neutron stars and black holes.
