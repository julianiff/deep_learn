This study will
              utilyze a radon isotopic study to determine transport rates and mixing patterns
              of water from the continental shelf to the deep basin.  The rate of decay of
              the naturally occurring radon is known, therefore the activity ratio of radon
              isotopes will yield information on the oceanographic processes transporting the
              radon to the basin.  The data from the Beaufort Sea derived in the project will
              be used in a circulation model to validate the results.  The project is very
              important to understanding the rate at which carbon is transported between the
              continental shelf and deep basin because it controls the availability for
              biologic production in the Arctic Ocean.  The results of this project will
              provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin
              Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic area.
