An important question in understanding any interspecific
              interaction is, "how will the interaction change as the interacting species
              evolve in response to each other?" For many interactions, observations of
              evolutionary change must be made over decades or centuries. In contrast,
              infectious diseases typically have short generation times, and because diseases
              often cause high mortality among their hosts, host-pathogen interactions often
              have the potential for demonstrating co-evolutionary change between host and
              pathogen over relatively short time scales. This study will investigate the
              co-evolution between gypsy moth and its fungal pathogen, Entomophaga. This
              host-pathogen system shows features of both novel and natural associations. For
              this host-pathogen interaction, there are host populations in different
              geographic regions that have had very different lengths of association with the
              pathogen. Moreover, the sudden appearance of the disease after almost 80 years
              suggest that there recently have been drastic changes in the fitness of the
              pathogen. The specific objectives of this project are to determine the
              introduction history of the pathogenic fungus across the range of the gypsy
              moth host, to determine the degree of variation in virulence of different
              strains of the pathogen, and to use this information to begin to assess the
              co-evolutionary response of this host-pathogen interaction. Overall, this
              research is strongly tied to the theory of host-pathogen co-evolution, and thus
              to the study of co-evolution in general, but will also be of practical use in
              using the fungal pathogen to manage gypsy moth populations.
