This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              applied mathematics involves Walter A. Strauss, C. Shu and Yan Guo of Brown
              University and Pierre Degond of the Universite Paul Sabatier and Frederic
              Poupaud of the Universite de Nice.  The project is aimed at the design,
              development, analysis and numerical simulation of hybrid quantum kinetic models
              and their application to the simulation of quantum semiconductor devices.  In
              many applications, the quantum effects are important only in subregions of the
              device, while the phenomena in a larger domain are governed by classical
              transport.  The objective of this project is to design models that are able to
              switch from a classical description to a quantum description.  The US
              investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in classical modeling and
              simulation.  This is complemented by French expertise in quantum models.
