Abstract    :
              The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory research is to use genealogical
              approaches to identify critical amino acid substitutions during the evolution
              of new mating type gene function in the basidiomycete fungus Coprinus cinereus.
               Previously, DNA sequence and genealogical analyses were used to describe the
              evolutionary history of alleles at a single mating type gene, bl.  The bl gene
              lies within the complex A mating type locus.  An examination of the genes in
              related species and additional analyses were used to identify amino acid
              substitutions that may have been important for the evolution of new mating type
              function.  Those inferences are being tested by making site-directed mutations
              in alleles of bl and testing for changes in mating type.  If successful, thias
              approach will provide a new method of analyzing and obtaining functional
              information from sequence data sets as well as providing a greater
              understanding of the evolution of mating type genes.
