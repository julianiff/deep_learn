The proposed work explores fundamental materials science
              issues in the area of growth and patterning on surfaces. It provides a basis
              for developing universal methods for depositing nanostructures: linear arrays
              of nanoclusters or molecules, single atom rows, and insulated metal stripes on
              silicon. The new features in the electronic structure of these one- and
              two-dimensional arrays will be determined by a variety spectroscopies, such as
              angle- and spin-resolved photoemission, inverse photoemission, core level
              absorption and fluorescence, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The research
              students in this program are exposed to state- of-the-art surface science and
              thin film growth techniques. They are learning fundamental materials physics,
              while learning how to direct creative research in ways that may lead to
              advanced technological  applications.

This research project deals with
              fabrication of tailored materials that are assemble by decorating regular
              arrays of atomic steps. New patterning methods will be developed where atoms,
              molecules, or clusters arrange themselves spontaneously at a stepped crystal
              surface. The research students in this program are exposed to state of the art
              surface science and thin film growth techniques. They are learning fundamental
              materials physics, while learning how to direct creative research in ways that
              may lead to advanced technological  applications.
