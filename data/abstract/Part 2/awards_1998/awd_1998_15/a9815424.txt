Isolated populations within species gradually diverge
              genetically through the combined effects of mutation, genetic drift, and
              natural selection. Two types of selection may be important: (1) selection for
              adaptation to local environments (which has received wide attention), and (2)
              selection favoring coadapted sets of alleles within each population.  The
              proposed work focuses on the latter process, which has been relatively
              understudied.
Coadaptation is best observed in laboratory crosses between
              individuals from isolated populations.  Such crosses typically result in
              reduced physiological performance in second-generation hybrids as the coadapted
              sets of alleles within each population are disrupted by recombination.  Using
              the copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model system, the proposed experiments
              will assess the level of coadaptation in two physiological/genetic systems: 
              (1) activity of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, and (2) rates of transcription
              of ribosomal RNA genes.  Both these systems are known to require extensive gene
              interaction, making them especially likely to experience selection for
              coadaptation.

The proposed studies of coadaptation within populations are
              fundamental to understanding the importance of genetic variation within and
              between natural populations.  Although the maintenance of genetic diversity is
              often espoused as a primary goal of conservation efforts, the extent to which
              such variation is vital to the ecology and evolution of species is poorly
              understood.  By focusing on the function of genetic diversity in natural
              populations, the proposed work may provide a firmer experimental basis for such
              conservation efforts.
