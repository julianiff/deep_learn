Feedbacks between calcium cycling and
              canopy tree dynamics in a north temperate forest

There has been widespread
              concern that acid deposition is depleting the supply of  calcium (a critical
              nutrient for plant growth) in the soils of northeastern U.S. forests.  Tree
              species in those forests appear to differ strikingly in both their demand for
              calcium, and their effects on the availability of calcium in the soil.  The
              proposed research will (1) determine the mechanisms by which tree species
              regulate the availability of Ca in the soil beneath them, (2) determine the
              responses of tree seedlings and saplings to variation in Ca availability, and
              (3) develop a quantitative, predictive model of the long-term consequences of
              these processes for the dynamics of northeastern forests.   The research will
              provide a bridge between two traditionally distinct fields of forest ecology: 
              the study of population and community dynamics of forest trees, and nutrient
              cycling in forest ecosystems.
