Abstract    :
              	The XVI International Botanical Congress (16th IBC) is held under the auspices
              of the International Union of Biological Sciences, and meets every 5-6 years,
              most recently (1993) in Tokyo. The 16th  IBC, the last this century, will meet
              in St. Louis, in August 1999, and is expected to host 5,000 or more plant
              scientists from around the world. Recent past congresses have been relatively
              inaccessible to persons of more modest means such as students and scientists
              from developing countries. The NSF grant will support travel costs for Congress
              attendees and participants from the two targeted groups, young U.S. scientists
              and scientists from developing countries. The goal is to make the 16th IBC an
              interdisciplinary conference that will provide unique opportunities for U.S.
              and foreign scientists to meet and initiate collaborations and partnerships
              across a broad spectrum of modern plant sciences.
	A comprehensive program of
              symposia and other presentations has been developed, focusing on six broad
              themes: biological diversity (systematics and evolution); ecology, environment,
              and conservation; structure, development, and cellular biology; genetics and
              genomics; physiology and biochemistry; and plant biotechnology. Convenors and
              keynote speakers include leading scientists from around the world active in all
              of these areas of research and education. Special efforts have been made to
              involve Canadian and Mexican scientists in the overall organization of the
              congress, and foreign scientists participate with U.S. counterparts in the
              organization of nearly every keynote symposium. The organizers have established
              a website to help disseminate information about the Congress and to encourage
              as great participation as possible (www.ibc99.org).
