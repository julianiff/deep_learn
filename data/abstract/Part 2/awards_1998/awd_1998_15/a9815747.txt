This award supports a three year collaborative research project
              between Professor Stuart Raby of Ohio State University and Professor Ken-ichi
              Hikasa of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  The researchers will be
              undertaking a study concerning the phenomenology of physics beyond the standard
              model.  It is desirable to combine the phenomenological and theoretical
              expertise of the collaborators to make maximal progress on important research
              problems at the forefront of particle physics.  They will be undertaking
              studies on the following models:  1) physics at linear e+e- colliders;  
2)
              Higgs boson physics;  3) supersymmetry and rand unified theories;  4) neutrino
              mass and oscillations;  5) astrophysics: neutrinos and SUSY dark matter; and 
              6) B physics.   

This project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Both
              groups are strong in electroweak phenomenology and grand unified theories
              (including supersymmetry).  The research results are expected to be beneficial
              in advancing the understanding of basic particle physics questions at the
              forefront of the field.  This research advances international human resources
              through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the
              exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic
              knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.
