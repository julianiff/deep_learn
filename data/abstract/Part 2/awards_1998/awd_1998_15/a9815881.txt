              ABSTRACT


	This study will use molecular markers to address a question about
              migration patterns in the in the Giant Amazon River Turtle of South America. 
              These turtles are colony nesters (adult females emerge simultaneously to nest
              on specific beaches), and limited evidence suggests that females show high
              "homing" fidelity to the same beach each year.  The goal of this project is to
              use molecular genetic markers to test the "natal homing" question, because it
              leads to unambiguous expectations about the distribution of genetic variability
              within and between river basins.  River basins will be sampled throughout
              Brazil's portion of the Amazon watershed.

	The intrinsic interest of this
              work derives from its application of new models gene flow to a widespread
              species whose migration routes constrained to a "rectilinear" grid (the
              rivers), but it will also have practical implications for ongoing conservation
              programs in Brazil.  The government monitors and protects many of the most
              heavily used beaches, but management plans are not based on any knowledge of
              the genetic uniqueness of any of the populations.  Further, the funds available
              for training of Brazilian investigators will enhance their understanding of the
              connection between the use of molecular genetic markers and applied ecological
              issues.
