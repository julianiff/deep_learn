The Franklin Institute proposes to develop Kid Science, a
              4,000 square foot, bi-level, core exhibit space for parents and children ages
              5-8 years old.  Kid Science will accomplish two parallel goals:  First, it 
              will provide parents information and insight about K-4 National Science
              Education Standards, theories of learning and development, and suggestions for
              interaction with children.  For children, the exhibit will be an introduction
              to basic science learning principles as defined by the national science
              standards for children ages 5-8, and encourage collaborative learning to foster
              beneficial parent/child interactions.

The development of the Kid Science
              exhibit will serve as a model to build upon research for establishing effective
              methods for communicating directly to parents and caregivers through exhibit
              activities.  These activities will be specifically designed to reach elementary
              age school children and their parents.

The cost share for this project is
              33% of the total project cost.
