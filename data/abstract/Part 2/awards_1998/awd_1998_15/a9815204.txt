This award supports a three year collaborative research
              project between Professor Forman Williams of the University of California, San
              Diego and Professor Junichi Furukawa of the Tokyo Metropolitan Technical
              College in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study concerning
              burning velocities of flamelets in turbulent premixed flames.  The objective is
              to improve understanding of the flame structure in the flamelet regime.  The
              flamelet regime is the regime in which the chemical times are short compared
              with the turbulence times.  In this regime, the turbulent flame is composed of
              an ensemble of moving premixed laminar flamelets.  The U.S. collaborator has
              derived theoretical relationships between the turbulence strain rates and the
              structures and propagation velocities of the flamelets.  The Japanese
              collaborator has developed a four-element electrostatic probe that potentially
              can measure these properties of flamelets in premixed turbulent flames. 
              

This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have
              complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers'
              expertise is in the area of theoretical analyses and understanding and the
              Japanese have expertise in the experimental techniques and results.  If
              successful, this approach could be widely adopted, since it is easier to
              operate and the apparatus is less expensive than the optical approaches. 
              Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our
              base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
              cooperation.
