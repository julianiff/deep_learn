This proposal describes a research effort to develop and
              understand an innovative-coupled hybrid magneto-mechanical composite material.
              The composite represents a magnetostrictive (active) material that elastically
              deforms when subjected to an external magnetic field. It contains a blend of
              both magnetostrictive and hard/soft ferromagnetic particles with a binder resin
              and it is cured under a spatially variant magnetic field. The magnetic field
              applied during cure aligns the particulates into continuous chains and forms a
              continuous magnetic circuit within the material. The hard/soft ferromagnetic
              particles enhance the magnetic properties of the composite and directly
              influence magnetostriction. One of the primary basic science questions is to
              what extent does magnetic interaction between dissimilar particles contribute
              to altering the internal magnetic circuit. The
              Hybrid-Magnetostrictive-Particulate-Composite (HMPC) provides several
              advantages when compared to the monolithic magnetostrictive materials including
              increased fracture toughness, reduced hysteresis, larger bandwidth response,
              elimination of external biasing and preloading, and possibly decreased drive
              levels.
