This three-year award will support US-France collaborative
              research on structural characterization of liquid-crystal compounds by resonant
              x-ray scattering.  It involves US researchers Cheng-cher Huang, P. Mach of the
              University of Minnesota, R. Pindak of Bell Laboratories, L. Furenlid of
              Brookhaven National Laboratory and French researchers Philippe Barois, H. T.
              Nguyen, Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal and A. -M. Levelut of the University of
              Paris at Orsay.  The investigators propose to conduct collaborative x-ray runs
              at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble and at the National
              Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven in order to obtain higher quality data
              and more detailed structural information about new liquid-crystal compounds and
              liquid-crystal free-standing films.  They propose to design and construct an
              analyzer that will be sensitive to the intensity and the polarization state of
              the scattered x-rays.

The US investigators bring to this collaboration
              experimental expertise in liquid-crystal compounds.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in x-ray scattering and in the synthesis of liquid-crystal
              compounds.   Determining the structure of new liquid-crystal compounds will
              advance understanding of new materials for infrared and microwave
              liquid-crystal modulators, and fast-switching liquid-crystal displays.
