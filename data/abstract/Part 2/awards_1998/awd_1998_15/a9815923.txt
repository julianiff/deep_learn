Abstract    :
              This workshop will explore some of the linkages between the  markets, the
              population and the sustainability of the North  Pacific region by identifying
              the changes that are occurring  in the marine and coastal environments as a
              result of  expanding populations and markets, and to determine the  impact that
              limits on these marine resources might have on  North Pacific economies.  The
              workshop will focus on the following specifics:  1) the investigation of links
              (if any) between the region's  demographic growth and the market changes and
              the change in  resource usage;  2) the gathering of knowledge on how the
              region's  governments have attempted to manage the growth through  policy
              changes;  3) the development and discussion of proposals to balance 
              sustainable use of resources with consumer demand;  4) the formation of a
              regional network to promote the  exchange of information on issues related to
              the  development, conservation and management of North Pacific  ocean and
              coastal resources.  There have been no previous in-depth studies of the inter- 
              relationships between population, market trends and  sustainability of marine
              resources. This workshop will  increase knowledge and awareness about the
              current situation  and possible future trends, and should result in the 
              generation of policy recommendations and models that can be  distributed to
              governments and other key decision makers.
