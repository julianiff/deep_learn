Both DNA binding specificity and stability depend upon
              structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties unique to each protein/DNA
              complex. Homeoproteins are an important class of well-defined DNA binding
              proteins that have been amenable to many and varied techniques designed to
              reveal the nature of protein/nucleic acid interactions. These proteins are
              extremely important transcription factors that regulate crucial stages in the
              development of eukaryotic organisms. This project seeks to provide the
              necessary foundation for extensive structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic
              studies of the DNA binding stability and specificity of natural and recombinant
              Isl-1, a metal-containing homeodomain (HD) protein that binds to and regulates
              the rat insulin-I gene enhancer. The objectives of the current project  are: 1)
              to purify soluble Isl-1 from an E. coli expression strain; 2) to characterize
              Isl-1:DNA binding conditions; and 3) to deduce a general solution structure
              description of DNA binding via transitional metal cleavage (TMC) methodologies.
              The initial characterization supported by this starter grant will provide the
              foundation upon which more extensive studies on the Isl-1 DNA binding even may
              be designed. 

Such studies are important because they increase our
              understanding of the molecular details of processes that determine why specific
              genes are expressed at specified times during development.
