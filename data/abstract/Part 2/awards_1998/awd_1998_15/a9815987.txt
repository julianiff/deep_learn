The intent of this project is to upgrade the
              University of Denver's existing computer hardware in the Climatology Laboratory
              to enable UD to incorporate real-time meteorologic and hydrologic data
              available via the Unidata Internet Distribution Data (IDD) system in the
              variety of atmospheric science courses taught at UD.  In addition, reactivation
              of receipt of the IDD datastream will ehnace opportunities for faculty research
              in climatology, meteorology, and hydrology.
