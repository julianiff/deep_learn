The World Congress of Science Producers is an annual event of
              leading broadcasters and independent science producers from around the world. 
              This year's congress is being planned and osted by WGBH.  For this Congress,
              WBGH will add two new dimensions to the meeting: 1) involve working scientists
              in the meeting to increase the dialogue and contact between broadcast
              journalists and scientists, and 2) partially support attendance by individuals
              who are either are considering entering science journalism or are newly
              involved in the field.  Sessions that include scientists include:  an
              exploration of the most important science stories that journalists should be
              covering, an in-depth analysis of a specific science issue, a discussion of
              ethical issues related to genome research, legal issues related to science in
              the courts, an examination of coverage of science vs. pseudo-science, and
              visualization of science.
