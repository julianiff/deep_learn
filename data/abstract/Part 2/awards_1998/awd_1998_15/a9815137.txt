This grant supports the Engineering Foundation
              conference titled "Small Fatigue Cracks: Mechanics and Mechanisms" to be held
              December 6-11, 1998 in Kona, Hawaii.  The principal objective of this
              conference is to bring renewed focus on the aspects of small fatigue cracks. 
              Of special interest are new developments related to mechanisms and related
              mechanics, owing to their relevance to many diverse engineering applications. 
              Through invited presentations from experts, the conference will foster links
              between veteran researchers, young investigators, graduate students and
              application engineers by providing a forum for discussion of concepts and new
              directions.  All interested authors and attendees from universities, research
              laboratories and industry will be encouraged to participate.  A compendium of
              papers presented will be published as proceedings.
A concerted effort is being
              made by organizers to involve a number of young scientists, graduate students
              and minority participants.

The subject of small fatigue cracks has drawn
              intense scrutiny in modern fatigue and fracture research.  The increased use of
              high strength, low toughness structural materials has resulted in smaller crack
              sizes required for catastrophic failures.  Therefore understanding the nature
              of small crack growth and improving the capabilities for predicting fracture
              are critical to the design of advanced structures.
