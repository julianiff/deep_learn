Tataru
This award supports the PI, Daniel Tataru and a graduate
              student from Northwestern University in a collaboration with Herbert Koch of
              the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.
               The research focus is on problems in partial differential equations.  In
              particular, the collaboration will address whether or not given data sets lead
              to well-posed problems, whether or not solutions can be uniquely continued for
              certain partial differential operators.  Many of the results will be important
              for dealing with currently interesting physics and engineering problems.  The
              collaboration will combine the complementary knowledge and experience of the
              German and U.S. groups and enlarge the areas of expertise on both sides.
