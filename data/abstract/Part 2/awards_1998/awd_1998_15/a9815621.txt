Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that multiply
              by inserting themselves into new DNA positions. TE transpositions are a major
              source of mutation in higher eukaryotes including humans. Little is known,
              however, of how transpositional activity is regulated.  

Dr. Nuzhdin will
              infer the relative contribution of natural selection and host-TE co-evolution
              in maintaining a stable number of TE copies in a host genome. TE activity is
              normally restricted by the host; however, many genomes have evidence of sudden
              TE explosions.  

Dr. Nuzhdin will first test the hypothesis that TE
              expression is deleterious. This hypothesis will be supported if natural
              selection acts more strongly against expressing TEs than against those lacking
              promoters. The second specific aim is to infer what causes TE explosions in
              model experimental Drosophila populations.  For this, the host genes
              responsible for the restriction of copia transposition will be identified, and
              their variants permitting transpositions will be molecularly characterized.
              

Results will shed light on the factors determining TE activity, and their
              maintenance and spread in natural populations. This knowledge will help to
              prevent possible future instances of TE explosions, which are likely in species
              escaping natural selection in captivity, as well as in humans.
