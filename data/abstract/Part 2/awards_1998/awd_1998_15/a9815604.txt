This award supports the PI, Ercan Alp, and two postdoctoral
              students from Argonne National Laboratory in a collaboration with Eberhardt
              Burkel of the Department of Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany.  The
              research focus is on using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering to study
              crystalline and glassy solids and liquids.  The U.S. group has pioneered the
              development of high-energy resolution monochromators, as well as direct
              measurement of phonon density of states.  The German group is also a pioneer in
              the field of inelastic x-ray scattering and will be indispensable in the
              project's goals of building better crystal analyzers and developing hitherto
              unknown techniques to create a tunable x-ray spectrometer for high-energy
              x-rays.
