This research involves the acquisition of a set of
              high-resolution seismic reflection profiles across the Salar de Uyuni in the
              Altiplano of Bolivia.  This salar is the largest salt flat in the world and is
              a conspicuous remnant of the late Pleistocene Lake Minchin-Tauca.  The project
              has two major objectives:  (1) to produce a stratigraphic and paleoclimate
              record for Pleistocene deposits within the southern basin of the Altiplano by
              imaging interbedded layers of lake marls and salar salt down to depths of
              300-500 meters and (2) to document the extent to which the Quaternary lake
              stratigraphy is affected by neotectonic deformation in the form of either
              isostatic rebound or active faulting across the 100-km wide salar.  The seismic
              profiles will reveal depths to significant stratigraphic boundaries, which are
              expected to chiefly reflect the alternating marl and salt layers that were seen
              in the only deep (120 m) core that has been recovered from beneath the salar. 
              The marl is deposited during stable phases of deep lake cycles (approximately
              100-m water depth) and the salt is deposited during terminations of deep lake
              cycles, when lake level is low or falling.  The present salar surface is flat
              to within 1 m over a 100 by 100-km area.  Lateral variations in depth to the
              tops of buried salt units will mostly reflect isostatic response to lacustrine
              water and sediment loads, and an unknown component of neotectonic deformation. 
              One of the significant puzzles these data will address is the discordant
              indicators of regional tilting associated with the uppermost salt unit, which
              thickens to the east, and the highest Lake Minchin shoreline, which tilts down
              to the west.
