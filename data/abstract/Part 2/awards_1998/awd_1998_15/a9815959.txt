This award  seeks resources to update and expand the
              University of Hawaii (UH) VISION LAB to maintain state-of-the-art workstation
              technology in the UH School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology  (SOEST).
               VISION LAB utilizes data streams from Unidata, and NOAA NWS to bring real-time
              weather data to UH, and interacts with Unidata's support environment to develop
              new software capabilities and data resources for the tropical Pacific Region. 
              The goals of this award are to acquire necessary hardware resources to 
   
              (i) Failitate NOAAport data exchange with the Honolulu National Weather Service
              Forecast Office which recently moved into our building on the UH campus,
   
              (ii) Develop an historical archive capability that allows automated remote
              access to central Pacific data sets for research and education, and 
    (iii)
              Keep pace with the demand on computational resources of an increasing data
              stream and increasing numbers of students vying for worksttion access.
