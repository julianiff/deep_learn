Although electron diffraction techniques have been successful
              at revealing many of the detailed structures of solid surfaces, earlier
              trial-and-error approaches are limited in their application to increasingly
              complex surface structures and compositions.  The PI proposes the development
              of improved direct algorithms based on a holographic approach for analyzing
              electron diffraction experimental results.  Collaboration with experimental
              efforts are planned involving photoelectron holography, low energy electron
              diffraction, and reflection and transmission high energy electron diffraction
              with researchers from Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of
              Erlangen-Nuernberg.  Additional work is planned in the development of direct
              algorithms for surface xray diffraction to determine the entire
              three-dimensional charge density of the surface layers, collaborating with
              experimental work at the University of Munich.

Much like optical
              holography can generate three-dimensional images of objects, electron beams
              scattered from surfaces can be used to generate holographic images of atoms and
              their accompanying electron charge densities at the surfaces of materials.  The
              object of this research proposal is to develop better mathematical algorithms
              for decoding experimental data into such images, and collaborative work with
              experimentalists using a variety of electron scattering techniques is planned. 
              These methods are important for basic research, but are particularly important
              for surface-critical applications ranging from catalysis to corrosion.
