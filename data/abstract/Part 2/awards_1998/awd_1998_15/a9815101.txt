              $92,575  for 12 months beginning October 1, 1998    Abstract    This conference
              focuses on the use of collaborative tools in math  and science education. 
              Through a combination of teachers and  college faculty, half attending the
              on-site conference in Orlando  and half attending the remote linkages to
              Illinois, Iowa and  North Carolina, at least 140 teachers will participate. 
              Two  follow-up meetings are to be held in each state.  The sessions  are
              presented from Orlando or from the participating state  teachers, and are
              anticipated to deal primarily with  computational science and the integration
              of technologies into  mathematics and science education.  Data is collected on
              the  impact of the conference through an online survey administered to  each
              participant.    The educational portion of the conference overlaps the main 
              conference, as will some of the other activities this year.  It  will include
              presentations by teachers and teacher educators on  using HPCC tools in
              schools, poster sessions, exemplary programs,  best uses sessions, shared
              lessons, and samples from implemented  curricula.  A secondary theme deals with
              the medium, examining  how one establishes a virtual community that can
              interact and  share freely.    Cost sharing is 77%.        Michael R. Haney
