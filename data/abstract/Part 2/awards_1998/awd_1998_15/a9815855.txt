Polyploidy is a mechanism that multiplies the chromosomal
              content of an organism, a process that is particularly important in plants.
              Approximately 70% of all plants have a polyploid origin, and major crops like
              wheat and cotton owe their agricultural productivity to recent polyploid
              events. Little is known, however, about the evolutionary fate of polyploid
              genes, and this is a broad gap in our understanding of plant genetics. This
              study focuses on genetic variation in Zea perennis, a polyploid that is a close
              relative of maize (corn). The goals of the study are to: i) measure genetic
              variation in polyploid genes, ii) analyze the pattern of genetic variation to
              determine the population forces acting on duplicated genes, and iii) determine
              whether the polyploid process occurred once or multiple times. Genetic
              variation will be measured by sequencing DNA of 3 genes from 30 individuals
              representing Zea perennis and its presumed ancestor, Z. diploperennis. The data
              from this project will be analyzed with data from previous studies of maize and
              other wild relatives.

As the first study of its kind, the proposed work has
              the potential to provide unique and general insights into a broad array of
              issues, such as the way polyploids form, the mode of inheritance of polyploid
              genes, and the relative importance of evolutionary processes like
              recombination, mutation and natural selection in shaping genetic diversity in a
              polyploid.
