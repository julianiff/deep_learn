Abstract    :
              

The research focus of this proposal is the impact of innovative and
              widely
advocated methods of teaching introductory biology on a broad sample
              of
UMBC undergraduates.  A 2X2 longitudinal study is proposed to
              examine
whether early exposure to student-centered, active-learning classes
              and
investigative laboratories in introductory biology makes a difference
              over
multiple years with respect to students' achievement, attrition,
              and
attitudes and beliefs toward and about the nature of science.  Students
              who
register for class and laboratory sections (class and lab are
              separate
courses) experience one of four pairings of lecture and lab (for
              example,
traditional lecture/investigative lab, active-learning
              lecture/tradtional
lab, etc.).  The question is whether long-term outcomes
              differ
significantly depending on which class/laboratory combination
              students
experience.
