Abstract    :
              An SGER award supports an exploration of a tribological coating for MEMS
              devices. A low temperature pulsed laser deposition technique will be used to
              deposit very thin (0.02-1um)titanium carbide coatings on prototype MEMS
              structures. The adhesion of the coating and its tribological properties will be
              evaluated. The deposition process will be optimized to provide maximum throwing
              power of the non-line-of-sight deposition as well as uniform, ultrathin,
              stoichiometric TiC wear resistant coatings.***
