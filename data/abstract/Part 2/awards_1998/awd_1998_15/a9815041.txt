Abstract    :
              Professor S. Ted Oyama will study the dry reforming of methane with carbon
              dixode to produce synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen).  This catalytic
              reaction will be run on membrane-supported Ni  and W in the metallic, caribidic
              and phosphidic form.  The CVD-modified Vycor and alumina inorganic membranes
              will provide additional driving force for the reaction by selective separation
              of hydrogen at high temperature.  The project will involve catalyst
              development, membrane characterization and investigation of their selectivity
              to hydrogen, kinetics measurement at various high pressures, mechanistic
              investigation by isotopic substitution, and modeling of the catalytic membrane
              reactor system.  The outcome of this research may impact the extent of use of
              natural gas as a chemical source, and provide a pathway for carbon dioxide
              remediation.  This proposal is funded by the following program of the Chemical
              and Transport Systems Division:  Kinetics, Catalysis and Molecular Processes;
              Process and Reaction Engineering; and Separation and Purification Processes.
