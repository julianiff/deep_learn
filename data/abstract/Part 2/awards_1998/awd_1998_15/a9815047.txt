Abstract    :
              Machine vision systems have had rather limited success in achieving
              understanding of image content in general cases, and the problem remains very
              difficult.  This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,
              supports an initial exploration of machine classification of image context, as
              a basis for further application of context-specific approaches to image
              understanding.  This effort will investigate methods to automate the
              identification of the type of an image (such as geographical map or wiring
              diagram) in the initially-limited domain of drawings, and then seek a top down
              strategy for further image analysis once the image type is known.
