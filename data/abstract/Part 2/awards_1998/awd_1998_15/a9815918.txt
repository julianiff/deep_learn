Abstract    :
              Professor Don Tilley, Department of Chemistry, University of California at
              Berkeley is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program to prepare and investigate silicon-based compounds and
              materials that possess chemical, structural and electronic properties making
              them potentially suitable for diverse scientific and technological
              applications. The principal strategy employed is to use transition metal
              reagents and catalysts that has resulted (through the years) in the production
              of a wealth of important carbon-based products. In the present instance,
              efforts will be focussed towards making "analogous" but silicon-based materials
              by examining first the fundamental transformations of silicon species (e.g.
              silylene, SiR2; silenes, R2Si=SiR'2, etc..particularly LnM=SiR2 systems) at the
              metal centers, and subsequently by exploring the structures, bonding, and
              structure-reactivity relationships in these species. Professor Tilley has been
              a leader in developing synthetic methodologies in metal-silicon compounds.
              Efforts will also be expended towards targeting new pi-systems containing
              unsaturated silicon and germanium atoms in the hope that these new systems will
              provide some unusual electronic properties that might give way to conjugated
              macromolecules incorporating double bonds in silicon and germanium.
