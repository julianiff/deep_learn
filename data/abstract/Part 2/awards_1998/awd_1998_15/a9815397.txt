Abstract    :
              Professor H. F. Schaefer at the University of Georgia is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his investigations
              of the electronic structure of molecules and their reactions.  Testing and
              calibration of new methods for the approximate solution of Schrodinger's
              equation will proceed with an emphasis on high-order electron correlation. 
              Applications of these and existing methods to relevant chemical problems will
              include ion-molecule reactions and highly strained organic species.

The
              first principles description of molecular species begins with a theoretical
              examination of the appropriate electronic energy surface(s).  Such potential
              energy surfaces, which describe the fundamental manner in which atoms and
              molecules interact, are critical to even a qualitative understanding of how
              chemical reactions occur.  Exploration of a variety of prototypical chemical
              problems may lead to the complete computer modeling of entire classes of
              important reactions.
