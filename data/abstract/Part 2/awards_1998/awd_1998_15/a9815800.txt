	The goal of this proposal is to characterize the
              structure and evolution of a family of immunologically important genes in
              birds.  These genes, called major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes, will
              be cloned and sequenced to understand the rates and pattern of DNA changes that
              have taken place during the evolution of this gene family.
	Mhc genes are of
              great interest to immunologists because they encode proteins that play a
              critical role the body's defense against disease in vertebrates.  Mhc genes are
              of interest to evolutionary biologists because they are the most variable
              regions of the genome of vertebrates. Most work on these genes, however, has
              been done on mammals.  By understanding how bird Mhc genes evolve, this
              research will permit a better understanding of how gene families in different
              groups of vertebrates change, and, by extension, whether or not the genomes of
              different groups of vertebrates change in appreciably different ways.  As
              large-scale genome projects near completion, it will be important to understand
              how the Mhc genome and the families of genes in it differ and change compared
              to those in other groups of animals.  This information is important for
              understanding the diversity of life and genetic change on earth, as well as for
              understanding how animals such as birds defend themselves against diseases and
              parasites.
