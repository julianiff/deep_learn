Connectivity and grain-scale distribution of melt in a
              partially molten rock control permeability, rheology, electrical conductivity,
              seismic velocitie and seismic attenuation.  This research is designed to
              quantify the evolution of melt topology during deformation of partially molten
              mantle rocks.  To date, most studies of melt distribution have concentrated on
              samples exposed only to a hydrostatic conditions; few have characterized melt
              topology in partially molten materials subjected to a non-hydrostatic state of
              stress.  The PI's recent experiments demonstrate that deformation has a
              dramatic effect on melt geometry and, consequently, on physical properties.  To
              apply observations concerning the influence of deformation on melt connectivity
              and distribution obtained under laboratory conditions to processes such as
              convection and melt migration occurring at mantle length and time scales, the
              mechanism by which melt redistribution takes place must be understood.  To
              address this issue, the PI has designed a series of experiments to quantify the
              physical parameters that govern the occurrence and nature of a
              deformation-induced melt distribution.  An important goal of these experiments
              is to determine quantitative relationships between deformation conditions, such
              as stress and strain rate, and melt distribution.  These results are essential
              for developing a theoretical framework that will permit reliable extrapolation
              of laboratory results to mantle environment and for utilizing experimental
              results to develop models of the dynamic behavior of Earth's interior.
