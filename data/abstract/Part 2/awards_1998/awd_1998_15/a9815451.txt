This proposal describes
              a strategic plan, "Strengthening Minority Access to Research and Training"
              (SMART) which seeks to increase the number and quality of minority
              undergraduate SEM majors at Southern University, Baton Rouge (SUBR) through
              research training.  The rationale being, that by strengthening this access,
              undergraduate majors will be better prepared to complete doctoral studies in
              SEM disciplines, thereby, helping to decrease the critical shortage of minority
              SEM doctorates.  This plan then, proposes strategies to accomplish the
              following objectives:  (1) develop partnerships for faculty and educational
              infrastructure; (2) implement an interdisciplinary research training-oriented
              SEM curriculum; and (3) provide collaborative hands-on research experiences for
              minority SEM majors of all classifications.
