Abstract    :
              This award provides support for laboratory preparation, diatom extraction and
              analysis from samples collected in the Dominion Range of East Antarctica.  The
              presence of marine fossil diatoms in glacial deposits of the Sirius Group in
              the Transantarctic Mountains has led to considerable discussion regarding their
              origin and significance.  Eolian transport (both local and long distance),
              sub-glacial transport from marine deposits, and atmospheric transport from the
              deep-sea as meteorite ejecta are all sources of diatoms which have. been
              described in the literature.  Assemblage composition, size, age, and other
              features can be used to separate these different sources.  Samples which
              yielded a wealth of stratigraphic and paleontologic information were collected
              at Oliver Bluffs.  This material is part of the Meyer Desert Formation, which
              is thought to be one of the most significant deposits of the Sirius Group. 
              Several tests will be performed to examine the occurrence of diatoms (which are
              known to occur) in these strata and in surface deposits across landscapes of
              varying age.  This project will verify the presence of diatoms and will examine
              their distribution along several profiles from 1-meter deep excavations in a
              vertical outcrop.  This study should help to answer questions about the source
              of the diatoms and the mechanisms by which they were transported
