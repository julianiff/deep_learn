                                                                                       This
              grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program  sub-element
              of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Mary Rezac
              at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The research is directed towards the
              development of nanoporous membranes via the partial pyrolysis of silicone
              rubbers.  These membranes operate through a concept known as "selective surface
              flow"  (SSF) where transport of heavy hydrocarbons is facilitated over that of
              hydrogen, by the selective adsorption of hydrogen on the pore surface followed
              by condensation in the capillary pores. The advantage of these SSF membranes is
              the fact that the hydrogen recovery is achieved at feed pressure. The
              innovative aspect of the research is the concept that the pore structure of the
              membrane can be controlled  by chemical modifications of the siloxane side
              chains, using a series of substituents with varying electron withdrawing
              properties.  This research represents highly exploratory work. If successful,
              the work will lead to the development of nanoporous membranes that have     the
              ability to withstand high pressure drops and can be processed into  high
              surface area modules such as hollow fiber modules.  Such membranes may be able
              to withstand the high pressure, continuous  operation required for efficient
              hydrogen-hydrocarbon separations.
