Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is an initial exploration of developmental
              learning by machines. This is motivated by human cognitive development from
              infancy to adulthood.  It requires a fundamentally different way of addressing
              the issue of machine intelligence.  The basic goal of the proposed
              developmental learning algorithm is to enable a machine to develop its
              cognitive capability, after its "birth," through direct interactions with its
              environment.  The developmental learning concept does not mean just from small
              to big and from simple to complex.  It requires the system to learn new tasks
              and, as a special case, new aspects of a complex task without a need for
              reprogramming.  The basic nature of developmental learning plays a central role
              in enabling a human being to incrementally scale up his or her level of
              intelligence from ground up.  In the proposed exploratory study, the major
              basic concepts for developmental learning will be crystallized and some
              preliminary experimental results will be produced for the focused task category
              of recognition through interactive training.
