This three-year award in support of U.S.-France
              collaborative research in optical materials involves George Stegeman of
              University of Central Florida's Center for Research and Education in Optics and
              Lasers (CREOL) and Alain Brun of the Institut d'Optique Theorique et Appliquee.
               The objective of their research is to investigate performance of poled
              polymers for nonlinear optics, using cascaded quadratic nonlinearities.  They
              will develop new polymeric material systems for use with "cascading" processes
              at telecommunication wavelengths that require low optical losses, processable
              polymers and highly nonlinear polymers.  They will investigate photostability
              properties and develop reactive ion etching techniques for channel waveguide
              fabrication.

The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              organic polymer materials.  This is complemented by the French group's
              expertise in hybrid inorganic/organic polymer materials prepared by using the
              sol-gel process.  The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of
              the properties of these materials and their potential use in telecommunication
              devices.
