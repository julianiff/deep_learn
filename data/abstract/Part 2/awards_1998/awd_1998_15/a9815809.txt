Abstract    :
              The investigators seek to understand the large-scale dynamics of solar flux
              tubes that lead to the morphology and evolution of active regions. Flux tube
              buoyancy is influenced by the rotation rate of the Sun (or star). Shear flows
              and shear rotation can enhance the accumulation of magnetic energy and thus its
              release. The orientation of currents in the flux tubes, as well as helicity of
              the magnetic field is also important in emergence of flux and interaction of
              flux tubes.  The main effort is to employ analytical methods and numerical
              simulations to illuminate the effects of differential solar rotation on flux
              emergence and flux tube reconnection. Computational and theoretic results will
              be corroborated by observations from the Yokoh and SOHO spacecraft.
