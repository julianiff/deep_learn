This award will support US participation in a US-France
              workshop on causes, consequences and mechanisms of dispersal at the individual,
              population and community levels to take place in Roscoff, France, April 24 -
              May 1, 1999.  Approximately 10 Americans and 15 Europeans, chiefly French
              scientists, will participate in the workshop.  The aim of the proposed workshop
              is to discuss and merge the perspectives of scientists working on various
              aspects of dispersal.  It will focus on (1) methods for studying dispersal; (2)
              the multiple causes of dispersal; (3) the behavioral mechanisms involved in
              dispersal; (4) the consequences of dispersal at the individual, population and
              species levels; and (5) perspectives for the study of dispersal in terms of
              gene flow and local adaptation.  

Dispersal is an important survival
              behavior in response to environmental threats posed by habitat fragmentation
              and global climate change.  The probability of a species surviving such changes
              is strongly dependent on its ability to tract shifts in the environment, either
              by moving between patches of habitat or by rapidly adapting to local
              conditions.  The importance of this behavior to all species provides the
              motivation for this workshop.  It is anticipated that the results of the
              workshop will lead to collaborations and future research in this area.
