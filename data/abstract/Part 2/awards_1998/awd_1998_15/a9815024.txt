This study is a petrologic investigation of the high
              temperature metamorphism and migmatization of mid- crustal pelitic pendants
              from the southern Sierra Nevada batholith, California.  The primary goals are:
              (1) determine the extent of partial melting of batholith metasedimentary
              pendants during the large scale plutonism, and (2) quantify the efficiency of
              two-component mixing between batholith- and pendant-derived melts and the
              incorporation of pendant melts into large granitoid plutons. This study is
              designed to test the importance of assimilation of pre-existing shallow crust
              in the mass budget of the composite batholith. The pelites of the study area
              underwent extensive high-grade metamorphism and local migmatization in response
              to the intrusion of large granitoid plutons during the late Cretaceous.  The
              isotopic ratios of Sr, Nd, and O of the batholithic rocks and the
              compositionally uniform pelite are distinct in the area. Hence, these isotopic
              ratios will be used as the principal tool in order to: (1) distinguish between
              batholith-derived and pelite-derived melts, and (2) constrain the mixing
              between the two in both migmatitic leucosomes and within the batholith.
              Petrographic studies of mineral and melting reactions within the migmatitic
              pelite as well as major and trace element chemistry will complement the
              isotopic data. The significance of crustal hybridization of Cordilleran
              batholiths with partial melts from metasedimentary host rocks is a
              controversial topic with important applications to quantifying crustal
              recycling in Phanerozoic magmatic arcs. This study should put important
              constraints on the extent and limits of such assimilation and hybridization.
