Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Sitz will perform state-to-state experiments involving
              molecular hydrogen and reactive transition-metal surfaces.  The focus of the
              experiments will be the hydrogen/copper and hydrogen/palladium systems.  The
              relative importance of translational, rotational, and vibrational motion and
              molecular alignment in determining the outcome of scattering events will be
              investigated.  Hydrogen molecules incident on the surface will be prepared in
              selected rotational and vibrational states using stimulated Raman scattering. 
              In some experiments the angular momentum vector of incident molecules will be
              aligned with respect to the surface normal to study steric effects in the
              interaction.  The fate of the excited molecules which do not survive the
              collision with the surface will also be investigated by measuring inelastic
              transition probabilities.

Central to understanding gas-surface interactions
              is knowledge of the importance that available degrees of freedom play in the
              dynamics.  The experiments in this project will provide insight into the
              dynamics of simple surface reactions by looking at the results of interactions
              of incident molecules in defined quantum mechanical states with surfaces.  The
              high quality data collected will be used to compare with and test high level
              theoretical descriptions of gas-surface interactions.
