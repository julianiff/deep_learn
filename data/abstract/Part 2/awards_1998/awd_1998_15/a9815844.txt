Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the study of simulated moving bed (SMB)
              chromatography for separations involving multiocomponent mixtures; the research
              is to be done in conjunction with an industrial collaboration worked out with
              the AST corporation.  It is planned to acquire a modified SMB unit for use in
              both research and undergraduate laboratories.   Both experimental work on
              aqueous sugar systems, and computer simulation are planned to be carried out
              during the grant period.  The main advantage of the SMB process arises from its
              reduced use of solvent and column packing materials when compared to
              alternative separations techniques.
