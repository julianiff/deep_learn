Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9815475  David L. Kaplan, Tufts University    This award is for
              partial travel support for academic speakers at the Nanotechnology Conference
              organized jointly by U.S. Army research organizations and NSF, at Cambridge,
              MA, on July 7-9, 1998.  This conference will examine research trends and
              exploratory research in the area of Nanotechnology, and identify areas of
              research emphasis that have relevance to U.S. Army.  Dr. Tom Tassinari will
              chair the Conference, in collaboration with representatives from other agencies
              and Prof. David Kaplan, Tufts University.  Both fundamental research issues and
              relevance issues will drive the conference proceedings.  This will provide a
              mean to discuss new ideas and their paths to new technologies.  A group of
              invited lectures will offer overviews and suggestion for future research. 
              Specific topics and planning activities will be analyzed in the breakout
              sessions and poster displays.  Interagency collaborative activities will be
              discussed.  An investment strategy in nanoscale science and technology will be
              a result of this conference.  A planning document will be published.
