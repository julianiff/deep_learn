Title:	The radiation of
              sponge-dwelling shrimp: a new system for the comparative analysis of social
              evolution

Eusociality, characterized by cooperative colonies of animals in
              which most members sacrifice individual reproduction, has long presented a
              fundamental paradox for behavioral and evolutionary ecology.  A comparative
              approach to deciphering the origins of eusociality, in which the ecology and
              demographics of eusocial species are contrasted with those of their closest
              non-eusocial relatives, represents a potentially powerful complement to
              behavioral studies at the individual and population levels.  The potential of
              this comparative approach remains largely unrealized because eusociality has
              arisen only rarely among animals, and many of these origins are ancient.  This
              project will reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the approximately
              40 species of sponge-dwelling alpheid shrimps, and use comparative methods to
              explore the ecological and demographic conditions associated with the repeated
              evolution of advanced social organization in this group.  Specific objectives
              of the proposed research are to produce a taxonomic revision of the
              gambarelloides species-group of alpheid shrimps, establish a strongly supported
              phylogeny for the group based on DNA sequences and morphology, and use
              comparative methods to explore the association between ecology and social
              evolution in sponge-dwelling shrimps.  This research will provide a rigorous
              comparative analysis of the history and ecology of social evolution in the only
              marine animal group in which advanced social organization is known.
