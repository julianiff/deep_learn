Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9815520  M. Paulitis/Johns Hopkins U.    An expedited award is
              requested to fund Dr. Markus Lesermann as a post-doctoral fellow for six months
              to carry out these experiments.  Dr. Lesemann is about to complete his
              post-doctoral appointment in my laboratory and will seek employment beginning
              this summer unless additional support can be found.  His recent NMR
              measurements of the CMA for C8E5 in water at kilobar pressures and his recent
              SANS measurements of C8E5 micelle structure in water at kilobar pressures have
              been enormously successful, not to mention very promising results.  As a
              consequence, he has agreed to extend his post-doctoral appointment to finish
              these exploratory experiments on microemulsions.  The time constraint to secure
              funding within the next few months is one reason for requesting an expedited
              review of this exploratory research proposal.  More importantly, though, the
              results so far, although exciting, are not definitive enough to warrant
              submission of a full proposal through the conventional NSF peer-review process.
               This is the second reason for requesting a small grant for exploratory
              research.
