This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              chemistry adds an international dimension to an NSF career award.  It involves
              Eric Borguet of the University of Pittsburgh and Eric Freysz of the Centre de
              Physique Moleculaire Optique et Hertzienne at the Universite de Bordeaux.  They
              will study the impact of thermal energy on chemical and physical processes at
              the interfaces.  A special probe, the Infrared Second Harmonic Generation, will
              be developed to study vibrational states and various aqueous interfaces,
              including electrochemical interfaces.  The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in solid-liquid interface.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in monolayer films.  The project also takes advantage of
              complementary instruments available at the US and French labs.  This
              collaboration will further understanding of the influence of thermal energy on
              interface processes, including adsorption, diffusion, chemical reactions,
              desorption, friction and lubrication.
