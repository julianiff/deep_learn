Abstract    :
              Carey  9815335    This proposal requests funding for a workshop, entitled
              "Workshop on  Amphibian Diseases and Immune Function", to be held July 26-28,
              1998, at  the San Diego Zoo. This workshop follows a "Workshop on Amphibian 
              Declines", held May 28-29, at the National Science Foundation. That  workshop
              brought together a number of biologists who have been working on  amphibian
              declines around the world. Several presentations focused on the  role of
              disease as a factor in amphibian mortality in the field. Since  amphibians have
              robust iminune systems that should be capable of defending  against all but the
              most virulent pathogens, the existing data suggest that  one or more
              environmental factors are altering the balances between  pathogens and hosts in
              a manner that is detrimental to the amphibians.  Since outbreaks of disease
              have recently been noted in a number of  different types of organisms,
              including coral reefs, turtles, and mammals,  these observations together may
              signal global environmental deterioration  to the extent that humans may also
              soon be at risk. The workshop will bring  together individuals who have
              observed amphibian declines in the field,  pathologists, epidemiologists,
              neuroinimunologists, endocrinologists, and  immunotoxicologists to identify
              what is known and what needs to be learned  about these mass die-offs.
              Identification of the pathogens involved in  amphibian mass-mortality, the
              manner by which they are successfully  infecting amphibians, and the reasons
              why the immune systems of amphibians  are not successfully protecting them is
              essential for predicting which  environmental factors might be the ultimate
              causal factors in amphibian  declines. A review of the findings will be
              published in Developmental and  Comparative Immunology.
