The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop "Investigations
              in Cell Biology," an integrated program that introduces cell, microbiology, and
              molecular biology to museum audiences through open-access, wet-lab,
              micro-experiment benches; training and support for school teachers; classes for
              adults and teens; and a long-term program for local high school youth.  The
              project includes the development, testing, and installation of four
              micro-experiment benches that introduce visitors to the objectives, tools, and
              techniques of cell biology experimentation.  These benches,"Inside the Cell,"
              "Testing for DNA," "DNA Profile," and "Microbe Control," will be part of "Cell
              Lab," a 1,500 square-foot open experiment area within the science museum's new
              core exhibition, "The Human Body," opening December 1999.
