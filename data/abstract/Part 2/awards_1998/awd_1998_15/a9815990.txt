This project will test and improve
              computer models designed to predict forest responses to deposition of ammonium
              (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) due to atmospheric pollution.  The investigators will
              determine how increased nitrogen (N) inputs influence forest growth, the uptake
              and release of atmospheric CO2 by forests, and N retention by forests at
              decadal time scales.  This will be done by resampling forests that were labeled
              with 15N (at non-radioactive isotope) tracers in the early 1990s and testing
              models by comparing predicted redistribution of 15N on experimental plots in
              central Massachusetts with measurements of tracers.  The revised models will
              then be to predict 15N tracer movements on a forest in Maine.  After a second
              round of testing, the improved models and GIS (Geographic information systems)
              software will be used to predict how N deposition is influencing forest  growth
              and forest-atmoshphere C exchanges in the northeastern U.S.
