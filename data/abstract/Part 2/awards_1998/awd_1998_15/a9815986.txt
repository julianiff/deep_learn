This award supports research in growth kinetics.  The PI
              will investigate models where frustration or defects lead to slow dynamics. 
              Langevin-type dynamical models of alloys where the order-disorder transition is
              accompanied by a structural distortion will be studied.  Interactions and
              pair-correlation functions calculated from electronic structure theory will be
              used to construct these models.  Fluctuation driven first order transitions
              that occur in diblock copolymers and are also believed to be relevant to
              ordering in a large class of alloys will be studied.  A combination of
              numerical simulation and field theory techniques using the dynamical action
              formalism will be used to investigate nucleation and growth processes that
              occur in these transitions.  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a frustrated
              spin model inspired by studies of alloys will be carried out.  The aim of this
              work is to gain insight into the nature of the glass transition and the origin
              of slow dynamics and aging in glasses.

This award supports
              multidisciplinary research and education to study processes that occur on long
              time scales and are important to growth and phase transitions that occur in
              alloys, polymers, and glasses.  These studies include the kinetics of growth in
              transition metal alloys such as Ni-V, Cu-Pd, and Cu-Au and phase transitions in
              diblock copolymers.
