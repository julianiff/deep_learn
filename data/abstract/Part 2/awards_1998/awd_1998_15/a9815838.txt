Abstract    :
              This ESH project will examine fine-grained laminae derived from floods in
              sediment cores from the Santa Barbara Basin, as a tracer of extreme
              precipitation periods during the last 5000 years.  Sediment analysis including
              X-radiography, particle  size distribution and clay mineralogy will be used to
              distinguish flood deposits from distal turbidites.  Radiocarbon dating willbe
              used to produce a chronolgy of the flood events, and the resulting record will
              be compared with other regional climate records, such as tree-ring indices, to
              interpret the long-term record of climate change in southern California at
              annual, decadal, and century-scale resolution.
