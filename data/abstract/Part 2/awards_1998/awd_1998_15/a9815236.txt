This project seeks to reconstruct
              the likely evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) for a large, diverse,
              cosmopolitan subfamily of bees called the Halictinae.  This subfamily is
              commonly referred to as the "sweat bees" because of their attraction to human
              sweat.  Halictid bees comprise roughly 20% of the bee fauna in most regions of
              the world, and are most common in the northern Hemisphere.  In the US there are
              as many as 320 species and some are important pollinators of native plants. 
              Halictid bees provide an ideal system for studying social evolution because
              species range from solitary to highly social.  The highly social forms are
              similar to honey bees in sociality in that there are morphologically distinct
              queen and worker castes, most of the reproduction is carried out by the queen,
              and workers aid the queen in foraging and nest defense.  How such societies
              evolve is a major question in evolutionary biology and only a few groups of
              organisms provide insights into this process.  The project will use a
              combination of morphological and DNA sequence data to infer the historical
              relationships among genera and among species.  The phylogenetic trees will then
              be used to understand how the social behavior of these bees has evolved through
              time.  Phylogenetic analysis will also provide a method for inferring the
              pathway taken from solitary to highly social behavior, and can be used to
              identify cases in which social lineages have given rise to solitary
              descendants.
