Primary
              production in Antarctic coastal waters is highly seasonal, yielding an intense
              pulse of biogenic particles to the continental shelf floor.  This seasonal
              pulse may have major ramifications for carbon cycling, benthic ecology and
              material burial on the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf.  Thus, we propose
              a multii-disciplinary program to evaluate the seafloor accumulation, fate and
              benthic community impacts of bloom material along a transect of three stations
              crossing the Antarctic shelf in the Palmer LTER study area.  Using a seasonal
              series of five cruises to our transect, we will test the following hypostheses:
               (1) A substantial proportion of spring/summer export production is deposited
              ont eh WAP shelf as phytodetritus or fecal pellets.  (2) The deposited bloom
              production is a source of labile particulate organic carbon for benthos for an
              extended period of time (months).  (3) Large amounts of labile bloom POC are
              rapidly subducted into the sediment column by the deposit-feeding and caching
              activities of benthos.  (4)  Macrobenthic detritivores sustain a rapid increase
              in biomass and abundance following the spring/summer particulate organic carbon
              pulse.  To test these hypotheses, we will evaluate seabed deposition and
              lability of particulate organic carbon, patterns of particulate organic carbon
              mixing into sediments, seasonal variations in macrofaunal and megafaunal
              abundance, biomass and reproductive condition, and rates of particulate organic
              carbon and silica mineralization and accumulation in the seabed.  Fluxes of
              biogenic materials and radionuclides into midwater particle traps will be
              contrasted with seabed deposition and burial rates to establish water-column
              and seabed preservation efficiencies for these materials.  The project will
              substantially improve our understanding of the spring/summer production pulse
              on the WAP shelf and its impacts on seafloor communities and carbon cycling in
              Antarctic coastal systems.
