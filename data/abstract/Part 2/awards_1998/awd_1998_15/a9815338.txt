Natural variations in the abundances of isotopes of the light
              elements oxygen, carbon and nitrogen will be used to study a variety of
              geochemical and cosmochemical problems. The fundamental thermodynamic basis of
              isotopic fractionation will be expanded by additional laboratory experiments
              and theoretical calculations. These results will be applied to the
              determination of thermal histories of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Particular
              emphasis will be given to rocks from the Earth's mantle in order to assess the
              degree of recycling of crustal rocks into the interior. The origin of the Earth
              and the nature of its raw materials will be studied through oxygen isotope
              abundances in meteorites. The three-isotope method is a very powerful tool for
              establishing genetic relationships among the various constituents of the early
              Solar System. Meteorite studies will focus on the primitive carbonaceous
              chondrites, in particular, on the processes of hydration and dehydration in
              asteroidal bodies. Some carbonaceous chondrites contain abundant organic
              compounds, including amino acids and carboxylic acids, which may have been
              formed either in the nebula or within asteroidal parent bodies. The site of
              formation of these compounds will be determined by measurements of their oxygen
              isotopic compositions.
