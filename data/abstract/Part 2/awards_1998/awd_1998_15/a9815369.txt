Much work has been done that documents the tremendous
              lost of biodiversity when tropical rain forests are converted to crop lands.
              However, little is known what happens when the agricultural land is abandoned
              and the rain forest begins its recuperation. The abandonment of crop lands in
              the tropical rain forest have always been practiced since Homo sapiens have
              been in that area and many ecologists believe that this historical disturbance
              regime in the tropical rain forests may explain the high diversity that is
              present in this system. However, what are the impacts of modern day
              agricultural practices? This project will examine that question and also ask if
              the type of agricultural practice determines how long it takes these forests to
              recover. More specifically it will examine the post-agricultural successional
              process in four agroecosystem types: 1) traditional agroforestry 2) migratory
              slash-burn, 3) cattle pasture and 4) modern intensive agriculture. The study
              will be conducted in the Peten of Guatemala and the Caribbean Coast of
              Nicaragua.  This research will use the diverse forms of extant agricultural to
              discern the details of how type of disturbance affects the successional
              processes that lead to particular patterns of biodiversity. It may not be the
              fact of agriculture that is important, but what type of agriculture. The
              results will have practical importance in areas of Neotropical rainforests,
              where agriculture is so frequently abandoned and restoration ecology is now
              just beginning. The results from this research may give restorationists in the
              neotropic rain forest the knowledge and tools to sensibly intervene in the
              restoration process.
