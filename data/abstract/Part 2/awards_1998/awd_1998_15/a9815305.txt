                 The NSF/DARPA jointly sponsored forum is organized by OIDA for discussion of

              with an audience consisting of industrialists, government policymakers and
              academia.  The exchange of information will promote a smooth transition of
              technolgies and adaptation of policies to meet the real needs of both
              industries and academia .  Students participation is also encouraged for their
              education and career development.
