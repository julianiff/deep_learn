Harrington, Melissa
Morehouse College
This proposal plans to
              develop research and educational opportunities in the neurosciences to enrich
              the academic preparation of students at Morehouse College, and stimulate
              interest in research as a career.  To implement this objective we are planning
              to expand the role of neuroscience in the academic and research program at
              Morehouse college.  First we will introduce a new undergraduate classes in
              neurobiology and developmental biology involving both lecture courses and
              investigative laboratories.  The development of laboratory exercises for the
              courses will be a collaborative effort drawing on the experience of faculty at
              colleges and universities throughtout Atlanta.  Establishing teaching
              laboratories in neurobiology and developmental biology will also require an
              investment in modern equipment and software.  In addition to developing new
              laboratories, we plan to upgrade existing laboratory classes and facilities at
              Morehouse College in psychobiology, physiology, cell biology and molecular
              genetics.  The new laboratories and modules we develop will use modern
              techniques and model systems to enhance the teaching potential of the labs by
              bringing the laboratory exercises closer to the experimental paradigms and
              techniques used in basics research.
