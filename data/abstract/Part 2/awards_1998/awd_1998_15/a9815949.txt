This award supports a three year collaborative research
              project between Professor Michael Taylor of Utah State University and Professor
              Hiroshi Fukunishi of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  The researchers will
              be undertaking a study of middle atmospheric dynamics including gravity waves
              and sprites using coordinated optical and radar measurements.  The mesopause
              region is often regarded as a "ceiling" or transition zone between the earth's
              neutral atmosphere and it's ionized "space weather" environment.  Tides,
              planetary waves and, in particular, small-scale, short-period gravity waves are
              now known to exert a major influence on this region through energy and momentum
              deposition.  However, detailed measurements of the thermal structure,
              composition and dynamical variability of the mesopause region are still in
              their infancy.  This study will focus on two important atmospheric phenomena:
              (1) short-period gravity waves and  (2) lightning induced Sprites and Elves. 
              The researchers will investigate dynamical and electrodynamical coupling and
              processes within the middle atmosphere through collaborative observations, data
              analysis and discussions.  

This project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. It is
              anticipated that results of the research will greatly enhance the potential for
              major advances in understanding these two basic phenomena. This research
              advances international human resources through the participation of graduate
              students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will
              broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
              cooperation.
