        The atmospheric concentration of
              CO2 (abbreviated [CO2]a) has increased from 280 ppm to 360 ppm during the past
              200 years and will double during the next century.  Increases in forest
              productivity (and hence C-storage in tree biomass) are anticipated with the
              increase in [CO2]a.  The increase in forest productivity will likely be limited
              by the availability of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).  We will examine
              the relationships between forest productivity and nutrient cycling in response
              to CO2 fertilization by working in a closed-canopy forest growing under
              Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) in the Duke Forest.  To test whether nutrients
              will limit the growth of forests under elevated [CO2]a we will measure: (1) N &
              P fluxes in soils (microbial dynamics, N & P availability); (2) N & P uptake by
              trees; and (3) the major controls over the flux of N & P from vegetation to
              soils.
