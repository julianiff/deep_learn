This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              computer programming languages involves Dale Miller and Catuscia Palamidessi of
              Pennsylvania State University and Francois Fages and Marible Fernandez of the
              Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France.  Their collaboration addresses the
              foundational aspects of concurrent computation from the direction of linear
              logic programming, proof nets, and concurrent constraint programming.  They
              will apply proof theory and linear logic to these different directions.  The US
              investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in linear logic and
              concurrency theory.  This is complemented by the French investigators'
              expertise in constraints and interaction nets.  The collaboration will advance
              linear logic and proof theory and their application to concurrent
              programming.
