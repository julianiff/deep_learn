Goldsmith
This award supports the PI, Judith Goldsmith, and a graduate
              student from the University of Kentucky in a collaboration with Martin Mundhenk
              of the Institute for Complexity Theory and VLSI Design at the University of
              Trier, Germany.  The research focus is on mathematical models of controlled
              stochastic processes such as assembly lines, automated medical diagnosis,
              ecological or economic systems, robot controllers, etc.  Several types of
              models will be looked at, and the main computational problem to be solved is
              the construction of optimal control policies.  The research is both theoretical
              and applied, with both the German and U.S. groups contributing to both areas.
