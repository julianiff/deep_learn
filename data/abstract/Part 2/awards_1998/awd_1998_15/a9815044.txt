This U.S.-Mexico award, jointly funded by the Divisiojn of
              Civil and  Mechanical Engineering, the Division of Design, Manufacture, and
              Industrial Innovation, and the Division of International Programs, will provide
              support for a collaborative research project between Dr. Jacob J. Stiglich,
              Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI), and Dr. Ramiro Perez  at the Institute of
              Physics of UNAM (IFUNAM), Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The investigators intend to
              continue cooperative research on protective coatings applied to steel
              substrates.  

Under the initial stages of the project, the researchers
              explored wear resistant coating performance utilizing two processes to coat
              steel substrates supplied by IFUNAM. Coatings were successfully applied and
              metallurgical bonds were established for all process conditions. Such bonds are
              essential for the successful industrial applications of any coating technology.
               This stage of the collaboration will investigate problems with deposited
              coatings due to the great thermal expansion mismatch between composites and
              steel. In particular, the investigators intend to address these problems by
              adding suitable stress relieving interlayers to the wear-resistant outer layer.
               Specimens manufactured by MMI, will be subject to high stress wear testing,
              corrosion testing and oxidation testing by IFUNAM.  Technologies developed by
              this collaboration are capable of rapid transfer to industrial usage.  By
              extending  equipment life-cycles with the use of improved protective steel
              coatings, this project should be of industrial benefit to both countries.
