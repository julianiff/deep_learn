The goal of this project is to formulate an
              earth-science-based curriculum for K-12 education of at-risk students.  The
              curriculum integrates science, mathematics, social sciences and language arts. 
              "At-risk" students are here defined as any group of students who are not able
              to participate in a continuous K-12 curriculum as offered in typical public
              schools in the U.S., Canada, or other industrialized nations.   The curriculum
              uses earth-sciences to capture the students interests and to deliver the other
              sciences, mathematics, social sciences and language arts.  The project name,
              "Science: Day-by-Day, Life-by-Life, Community-by-Community" reflects the focus
              on individual learner control, the long-term continuity that we hope to
              establish, and the adaptability of the curriculum to specific communities.  A
              World Wide Web site will be developed for delivering the material on an
              "as-able-to-learn" basis.  The curriculum is geared toward meeting the U.S.
              National Sciences Education standards, the U.C. National Council of Teachers of
              Mathematics standards, the National Geographic Society geography standards, and
              various language arts and social sciences standards.
