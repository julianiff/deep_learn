This award supports Leonard Shapiro and one or two graduate
              students from Portland State University in a collaboration with Bernhard
              Mitschang of the department of Information Science at the Technical University
              in Munich, Germany.  The research funded by this award will focus on
              optimization of queries to large data warehouses and against complex multimedia
              objects.  Current optimizers have proved inadequate to the needs of new
              application areas.  Indispensable to progress in this area are parallel data
              base management systems (DBMSs) to handle large data sets and object DBMSs to
              offer the necessary semantic capabilities.  The U.S. group possesses
              significant expertise in object DBMSs and the German group has designed a
              next-generation parallel DBMS.  Working together, the two groups will be able
              to understand how object and parallel DBMSs can be integrated into a single
              optimizer for improved performance of queries.  This type of advancement is
              crucial to knowledge management in a time when the amount of data to be
              processed and handled is increasing at an exponential rate.
