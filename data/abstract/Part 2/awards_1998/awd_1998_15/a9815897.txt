The Department of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the
              University of Illinois (UI) has been an active user of Unidata systems for
              nearly ten years.  The infrastructure and services built around the Unidata
              sytem and tools in DAS has allowed UI to make an umber of important advances in
              teaching, research, and outreacth efforts.  The data received via IDD and the
              concomitant analysis and display software are used in a number of undergraduate
              and graduate courses.  The use of locally-developed web-based tools, built
              around Unidata systems, in the classroom  has had a  significant impact on our
              teaching and student enrollment.  Because of extensive use in teaching, rsearch
              and outreach, Unidata systems are a highly valued resource within the
              department.  While the volume of data received in the department, the
              capabilities provided by Unidata packages and the uses of those data and
              software are constantly growing, the computers behind those tasks have not kept
              pace with the increaseing demand, and are unable to handle the myriad of tasks
              for which they are used.  The limitation posed by thes aging computers is
              serioulsy hindering our plans to enhance our educational and research programs
              in the department.  Therefore, replacement equipment is requested to continue
              to provide the level of access to students and to the Unidata community.
