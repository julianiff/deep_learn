This three-year award in support of U.S.-France
              collaborative research in economics involves Thomas R. Palfrey of the
              California Institute of Technology and Jacques Cremer at the Universite de
              Toulouse (Universite des Sciences Sociales).  They propose to conduct research
              on the political economy of federalism.  Most public policy outcomes result
              from a mixture of federal level policies and state or local policies.  The
              objective of their research is to investigate the economic and political
              factors that determine the mix of federal, state or local level policies and
              the implications for pubic policy outcomes.  They will look at different types
              of voting models.  One model will focus on voter preference in relation to
              centralization of policymaking and a second model looks at applications to
              federal mandates, and national standards related to environmental policy and
              education policy.  The collaboration takes advantage of the complementary
              expertise of the US and French investigators in political economic theory.
