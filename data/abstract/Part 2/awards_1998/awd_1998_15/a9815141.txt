Abstract    :
              9815141  Smith    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support a planning visit 
              by Dr. Nigel J. Smith of the University of Florida to Belem,  Brazil, to
              develop a collaborative research project with Dr.  Giorgini Venturieri of the
              Federal University of Para, on  the market impacts on agrobiodiversity among
              small land  holders in the Eastern Amazonia region.    Their project will look
              at the impacts of market integration  on the diversity of crops and varieties
              maintained by small  farmers in the rainforests of the Eastern Amazonia region
              as  they are increasingly pulled into the orbit of burgeoning  urban centers.  
               By examining the decision-making process of the  addition/dropping of crops
              and cultivars in response to  market forces, niche markets can be developed for
              heirloom  varieties of plants, thus resuscitating varieties that would 
              otherwise be lost.  ***
