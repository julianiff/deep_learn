Abstract    :
              The Bacteriology Collection is one of the most diversified assemblages of
              bacteria in the world. It currently holds close to 18,000 strains representing
              approximately 600 recognized genera. Approximately 20% of total strains were
              accessioned with NSF support (the "NSF-supported cultures"). In 1997, more than
              19,000 vials of NSF-supported cultures were distributed in the U.S. and
              throughout the world. These cultures were used in a variety of applications:
              teaching, quality control testing, industrial production, and research. In
              addition, the Bacterial Collection is recognized as a repository for standard
              reference cultures, and the strains are listed in a number of manuals and
              procedures.

Authentication and quality control have been and continue to be
              performed at the highest standard in the Collection. The majority of the
              strains have been identified extensively by a suite of physiological,
              morphological, and cytochemical characteristics that are specific to that
              species. New molecular methods are being evaluated for incorporation as routine
              quality control procedures to achieve a polyphasic taxonomic approach in the
              characterization of bacterial strains.

This proposal is a continuation of
              NSF BIR-9512045, which supports approximately 13% of the total expenditures
              required-for the on-going maintenance of the Collection, and for enhancing the
              quality of its acquisitions. These monies will also provide partial support for
              the Collection to set up standardized resources for microbial authentication in
              the next few years.
