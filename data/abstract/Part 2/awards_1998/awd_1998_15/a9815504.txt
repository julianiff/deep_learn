Abstract    :
              "The National Journal of Young Investigators".  This proposal requests support
              to launch a new journal (JYI) for the publication of research results in
              science and engineering performed by undergraduates with faculty mentors.  The
              JYI is not specifically physics related, rather it is intended to span
              essentially all of science and engineering.  The JYI will employ a peer-review
              process with students and faculty advisors to referee, select and edit
              submitted papers.  The process will employ the internet.  This project is
              multi-disciplinary in nature and therefore is supported through the Physics
              Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
