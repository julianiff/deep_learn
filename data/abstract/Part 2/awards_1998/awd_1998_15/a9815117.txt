Abstract    :
              	This dissemination project will provide access to materials developed by Rural
              and Urban Images:  Voices of Girls in Science and Technology (Voices)
              throughout the state of West Virginia, regionally, and nationally.  Voices is a
              research and development program that examines factors affecting rural girls'
              participation in science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) and enhances their
              SMT participation.
	Voices' partners include:  the Appalachia Educational
              Laboratory; the Eisenhower Regional Consortium for Mathematics and Science
              Education, which will provide an audience and venue for training; the
              Appalachian Rural Systemic Initiative (ARSI), which will disseminate materials
              and provide training; the Black Diamond Girl Scout Council, which will train
              its trainers with the materials and establish a badge for girls who use them;
              and the Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse/Center for Rural
              Education and Small Schools (ERIC/CRESS), which will produce with the Voices
              staff a monograph on gender, curriculum and family involvement issues. 
              ERIC/CRESS will also promote Voices materials in its newsletters and add them
              to its catalog.
	Sustainability is a feature of this project.  Girl Scout
              leaders will continue training others and using the Voices materials with girls
              for years.  Similarly, materials marketed by ERIC/CRESS will have a ripple
              effect, reaching broader and broader populations.
