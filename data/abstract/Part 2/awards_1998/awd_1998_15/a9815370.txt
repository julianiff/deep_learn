Since 1988, staff at the Archbold Biological Station have
              collected demographic and ecological data on thousands of plants of 10 Florida
              scrub species to answer fundamental ecological questions. Among these are
              whether population viability is affected by population size and fire regimes,
              whether long-term population dynamics and extinction are controlled by
              environmental stochasticity and rare events, whether long-term trends can be
              predicted from shorter-term data, and whether metapopulation persistence is
              likely even of local dynamics are unstable. Florida scrub populations have been
              studied at regular intervals over the last 10 years using consistent
              measurements, resulting in data summarizing survival, growth, fecundity, and
              recruitment for use in population modeling. This research has been coupled with
              intensive investigations of genetics, breeding systems, pollination, seed
              dormancy and microhabitat requirements. These plant data sets are longer-term
              and consider more populations than most other studies used to model population
              viability. These long term data sets allow characterization of environmental
              stochasticity, essential in modeling population viability and extinction. Data
              collection from a number of populations quantifies demographic variation with
              respect to microhabitat and the natural disturbance regime (fire) and allows
              modeling of population viability through the fire cycle and across
              metapopulations.
