This award supports the participation of American scientists in
              a U.S.-Japan seminar on Plant Pathogen Interactions and Delivery of Pathogen
              Signals to Plants, to be held in Marina del Rey, California from June 19-24,
              l999.  The co-organizers are Professors
Noel Keen at the University of
              California, Riverside and Shigeyuki Mayama at Kobe University in Japan.  The
              study of plant-pathogen interactions is one of the fastest moving areas in all
              of plant biology.  Recent advances in the cloning of plant disease resistance
              genes, biochemical studies and the isolation of key plant mutants, as well as
              conceptual and technical advances in the study of virulence mechanisms in
              pathogens, have coalesced to permit unprecedented progress.  

The seminar
              will consist of several topics.  These include:  1) pathogen signals perceived
              by plants;  2) plant disease resistance genes;  3) plant components receiving
              pathogen and other signals;  and  4) Global functions of disease resistance and
              susceptibility
It is expected that major and broad advances will be made
              through the success of this seminar with significance both for fundamental
              biology and for potential crop disease control strategies.  Seminar organizers
              have made a special effort to involve younger researchers, from both countries,
              as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with
              Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their
              own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.
