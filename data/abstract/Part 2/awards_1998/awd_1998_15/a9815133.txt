Canopy Herbivory and Soil Processes in a
              Temperate and Tropical Forest

Insects that feed on the foliage of trees can
              influence the quality of forest soils by dropping feces and fragments of leaves
              onto the forest floor. They can also modify the chemistry of rainwater that
              passes through the canopy. The effects of herbivore activity on the properties
              of forest soils are poorly understood. Potentially, insects may change soil
              fertility and the rates of decomposition of leaves that have fallen to the
              forest floor. In this project, the investigators will study the effects of
              insect herbivores on forest soils in a temperate and tropical forest. Sampling
              and experimental approaches will be used to assess the effects of canopy
              herbivores on soil nutrients and decomposition. The results of this study will
              improve understanding of how natural and managed forests maintain their
              fertility, and the role that insects play in forest and soil health.
