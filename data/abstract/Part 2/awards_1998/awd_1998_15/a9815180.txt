Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to pursue research on TIMSS using and
              international perspective and using the best available research technology.  It
              proposes using data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study
              (TIMSS) and gains the perspective of an international education community.  The
              research will be centered around a general model of educational attainment and
              focus on issues that affect student performance.  The grant will result in a
              publication of two volumes to be published by the IEA and with Elsvier Press.
