	The western margin of the U.S. was the site of complex
              tectonic interactions during the Neogene.  Basin and Range extension was
              encroaching westward into Sierran Crust while distributed dextral slip (thought
              to be plate margin related) was occurring in the Walker Lane region.  Cessation
              of arc-related volcanism with associated thermal effects also occurred, having
              migrated northward roughly in parallel with the Mendocino triple junction.  The
              interrelationships between these regional phenomena has been controversial. 
              This project will utilize the paleogeography and deformation evidence recorded
              in Neogene basins of northwestern Nevada to address these issues, and will
              involve structural, stratigraphic and geochronologic studies of exhumed Neogen
              basins in a broad zone along the Sierra Nevada-Basin and Range boundary. 
              Results will help answer several long-standing questions including temporal and
              kinematic between Walker Lane faulting and extensional faults to the east and
              west and uplift of the present Sierra Nevada.  This information will help
              illuminate other areas of active transtension in marginal continental
              crust.
