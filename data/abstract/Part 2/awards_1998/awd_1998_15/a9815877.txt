This two-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in economics involves Russell W. Cooper of the National Bureau of
              Economic Research and Hubert Kempf of the Universite de Paris 1 (Sorbonne). 
              They will investigate the costs and benefits of monetary union and the optimal
              structure of a monetary union in terms of the number of members and their
              characteristics.  Their preliminary research on the economic gains of monetary
              union will serve as a model for this project on costs and benefits.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration extensive experience in macro-
              economic research.  This is complemented by theoretical input from the French
              investigator and his institutional knowledge of France and the European Union. 
              The collaboration will advance our understanding of the trade-offs involved in
              adopting a common currency and the proper operation of a monetary union as we
              enter this new age of global economies.
