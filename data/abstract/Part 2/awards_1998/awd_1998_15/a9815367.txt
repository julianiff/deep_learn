Abstract

Genetical Theory of Population Divergence and
              Speciation

The goal of this research is to develop computer simulation
              techniques and analytic methods to study population divergence and speciation
              using DNA sequence data.  Foremost among the questions to be addressed is: what
              is the role of gene flow in divergence?  Gene flow is the result of migration
              between populations and its mark is visible in DNA samples.  This work will
              generate simulation-based tools for the analysis of DNA data using two
              different statistical approaches: maximum likelihood and method of moments. 
              Maximum likelihood will work best for small datasets and moment methods will
              work best for large ones.  The resulting computer programs will be made
              available to empirical workers.

Biology is the science of the future and, if
              we are truly to understand biological systems, historical analyses are more
              important here than in any other science.  This work will provide a framework
              for resolving the critical question: how has speciation occured?  For
              within-species data, it will allow us to identify the forces that have caused
              populations to diverge.  There are many theories of divergence and speciation,
              yet these have never been tested because DNA sequence data have only recently
              become available.  This work will allow biologists to extract historical
              information from the growing stores of DNA sequence data.
