Bhushan
This award supports Dr. Bharat Bhushan and two graduate
              students from Ohio State University in a collaboration with Walter Arnold of
              the Department of Applied Science at the Fraunhofer Institute for
              Nondestructive Testing (IZFP) in Saarbruecken, Germany.  The research funded by
              this award will make use of the techniques in dynamic force microscopy
              developed at the IZFP, also called ultrasonic atomic force microscopy (AFM),
              which can be used to measure static friction at velocities several orders of
              magnitude larger than that used in conventional AFM.  Localized sensitivity
              measurements of ceramics and polymer composites can be made to a degree not
              possible with other techniques.  The collaboration will make it possible to
              transfer the German technology to the Computer Microtribology and Contamination
              Laboratory at Ohio State.  The research plan will develop analytical tools and
              computer models to gain insight into the elasticity on nonhomogeneous
              materials, which could ultimately lead to new low-friction materials and useful
              mechanical property measurement techniques.
