The Interplay Between Local and Global Dynamics
              in Metapopulations of Social Spiders


ABSTRACT

Populations are often
              subdivided in more or less discrete units linked by migration, extinction, and
              recolonization.  When such a metapopulation structure is present, local
              populations may be in disequilibrium with respect to genetic or demographic
              traits, while the ensemble of populations may be stable.  Social spiders
              represent an ideal metapopulation system in which to study the interplay
              between local and global processes in a metapopulation.  Inspired by the
              biology of these organisms, computer simulation models will be developed to (1)
              explore the conditions under which extinction and recolonization may balance
              each other to allow the persistence of a metapopulation, and (2) explore the
              evolution of traits, such as clutch size and sex ratio, that affect local
              population dynamics and may be subject to selection at the group and individual
              level. 

This study brings together the fields of ecology and evolution to
              explore two potentially controversial issues: the evolution of chaotic
              population dynamics and the role that group selection may play in the evolution
              of life history traits in metapopulations.  These are issues of broad
              significance in ecology and evolution and of relevance to the conservation of
              species in fragmented landscapes.
