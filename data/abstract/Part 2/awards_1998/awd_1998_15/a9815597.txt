Organisms tend to be more invariant in the internal
              nutrient content that their surrounding environments.  This phenomenon,
              homeostasis, is a central factor in ecological stoichiometry.  In aquatic
              ecosystems, zooplankton exhibit substantially less variability in their
              nutrient content than the phytoplankton that they consume.  In this project,
              nutrient homeostasis will be examined at the population, community and
              ecosystem level using a combination of laboratory and field investigations. 
              Laboratory experiments will focus on five species of zooplankton chosen for
              their wide range of nutrient contents.  Animals will be fed food with different
              nutrient ratios and the time scales of animal response will be evaluated.  In
              field projects, the nutrient chemistry of food resources, zooplankton and
              fishes will be compared across a set of 60 lakes in Minnesota representing a
              north-south cline.  It is hypothesized that chemical variability will decrease
              moving up the lakes' food chains from algae to fish.  The project will test for
              a combination of positive and negative correlations across trophic levels in
              the different habitats.
