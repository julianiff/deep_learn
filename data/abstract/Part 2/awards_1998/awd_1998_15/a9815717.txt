This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Molecular Mechanism of Biological Rhythms, to be
              held in Hawaii from July 31- August 3, l999.  The co-organizers are Professors
              Gene Block at the University of Virginia and Hitoshi Okamura at Kobe University
              in Japan.  A detailed understanding of how cells and tissues generate
              twenty-four hour periodicities presents one of the great challenges to
              contemporary cell and molecular science.  The challenge is made formidable by
              the specialized properties of biological clocks that allow them to retain their
              accuracy through profound seasonal fluctuations in temperature and yet
              faithfully synchronize to environmental periodicities.  During the past two
              years there have been major advances in identifying a human timing gene
              homolog, both in the U.S. and in Japan, as well as steady advances in our
              understanding of the molecules involved in circadian timing in several model
              systems.  

The seminar will consist of four main themes:  1) the molecular
              clock of non-mammalian species;  2) the molecular clock in mammals;  3) new
              concepts to medicine; and  4) new concepts to medicine and biology - state of
              the field and educational outreach.  Seminar organizers have made a special
              effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The
              exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information from the meeting will be
              available on videotapes.  In addition, abstracts will be published on the NSF
              Center for Biological Timing home page  (http://www.cbt.virginia.edu).
