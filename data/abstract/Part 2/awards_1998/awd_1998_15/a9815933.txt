Abstract    :
              This workshop enables practitioners to discuss with some academic researchers
              technical and scientific issues in database implementation which have come up
              over the years. Talks are given by industry speakers about experiences they
              have had with difficult scientific or technical problems. This enables
              academics to see research from a practitioner's viewpoint and motivates the
              discussion on mutual support of academic-industrial research. Such mutual
              support might include visits from academics to industry or vice-versa, access
              to software packages, source code (possibly old source code), data sets,
              student visits to industry, industry support of students and so forth. In
              addition, the barriers to industrial-academic collaboration and technology
              transfer are to be discussed and potential solutions proposed. The objective of
              this workshop is to find out how to set up mechanisms of mutual support for
              academic-industrial research collaboration and to publicize these mechanisms.
              The results of the workshop will be disseminated via an online report and
              additional material will be made available at the workshop Web site.
