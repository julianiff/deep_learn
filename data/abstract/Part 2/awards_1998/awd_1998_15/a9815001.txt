Abstract    :
              The proposed study will use scale-anchoring techniques to describe three points
              on the mathematics and science scales of the 1995 Third International
              Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for all participatin g countries.  It
              will thus provide concrete descriptions of what mathematics and science
              students in high performing countries know and can do on tests.  It was
              proposed that scales be described at grade 4 and 8.  Grade 12 was excluded from
              this analysis because of the expense of conducting analysis of that population.
               The resulting "profiles" of "world class achievement" will provide US teachers
              and administrators with a benchmark against which to compare their student
              performance and their school standards.
