This project
              utilizes existing data on plankton abundance in the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas
              to characterize the mechanisms responsible for regional differences of
              productivity in the Arctic Ocean.  The role of shelf-basin exchanges of carbon
              will be examined and used in models once the role of light, oxygen, and
              nutrients on phytoplankton production is determined from the productivity
              patterns.  The model will be used for assessing secular to decadal changes in
              productivity and exchange in the shelf-basin system in response to expected
              changes caused by global change.  The results of this project will provide
              input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin
              Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic area.
