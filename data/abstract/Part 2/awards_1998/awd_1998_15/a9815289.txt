Tallgrass prairie on fertile, well-watered soils represents
              North America's "most endangered" major ecosystem, with most of those sites
              being converted to intensive agricultural. Thus, it is critical to know how to
              restore agricultural land to tallgrass prairie. A major part of any restoration
              project in tallgrass prairie will be understanding the roles of granivory and
              herbivory, especially by small mammals since much of the restored tallgrass
              prairie will not by grazed by large native ungulates. This project proposes to
              continue a study that is examining the effects of small mammal alteration of
              replicated tallgrass restoration. In addition, support is requested to take
              advantage of new opportunity presented by rodent suppression of legumes in
              rodent-accessible exclosures in southwestern Wisconsin using a series of
              experiments. These experiments use restoration techniques to test fundamental
              predictions from theories of animal foraging and plant competition. This work
              will contribute insight into the interactions of plants and animals that can
              only be garnered from an experimental approach, preferably carried out in
              synthetic assemblages rather than irreplaceable tallgrass prairie remnants.
