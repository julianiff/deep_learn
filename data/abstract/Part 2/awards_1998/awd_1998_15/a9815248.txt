Despite diverse attempts and
              methodologies, no consensus exists on the evolutionary relationships among the
              major groups of birds.  As an alternative to the intuitive classifications of
              the past, a comprehensive morphological analysis is needed to reassess the
              higher-order placements of a number of critical and problematic, fossil and
              modern avian groups.  This study will permit the completion of a several-year,
              collaborative assessment of the relationships among major taxonomic groups of
              birds based on a cladistic analysis of comparative anatomy.  The study will
              include all modern nonpasseriform families and a number of fossil groups, and
              is to be rooted using theropod dinosaurs and other archosaurian reptiles.  The
              anatomical comparisons will include the skeleton, musculature, and selected
              characters of the trachea and integument.  The total numbers of taxa to be
              included number approximately 175, and surveys to date indicate that a target
              of 1,300 characters is reasonable for an analysis of this scale.  The
              characters will be described uniformly using the comprehensive and precise
              technical nomenclature set forth in the Nomina Anatomica Avium.  The resultant
              hypothesis will provide a critical, first estimate of the evolutionary history
              of fossil and modern birds based on comparative anatomy, will facilitate
              comparisons of estimates across different data sets, and will shed light on
              current controversies concerning the origin of birds.
