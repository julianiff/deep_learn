TITLE: Responding to the Gender Gap in Informal Science
              Education

Under the direction of Kevin Crowley, the Learning Research and
              Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh will investigate gender bias
              in parental explanations in informal learning settings.  This project,
              Responding to the Gender Gap in Informal Science Education, will build on
              previous research at children's museums where the conversations of 338 families
              with children eight years and younger at sixteen different interactive exhibits
              were recorded and analyzed.  They found that parents were almost three times
              more likely to use explanations when interacting with boys than girls.  In this
              project they will conduct additional research to isolate the causes and
              outcomes associated with gender bias in these parental explanations and then
              they will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a range of low-cost methods to
              modify science exhibits to support parental explanation to both girls and boys.
               The latter will take the form of an Explanation Toolbox (XBox) which will be a
              set of resources to help museums construct and evaluate their own modifications
              to support non-biased parental explanations, with special attention paid to
              including explanations for the young girls, in addition to the usual
              conversations about manipulating the exhibits and about the visual, auditory,
              and tactile information produced by the exhibit.  Results of the research and
              the toolbox will be broadly disseminated via the World Wide Web and published
              research reports.
