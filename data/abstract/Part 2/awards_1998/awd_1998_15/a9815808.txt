This project will
              utilize existing data sets on the biomass, density, and composition of benthic
              organisms in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as an indicator of the patterns of
              sinking organic matter that provides the energy to sustain the benthic
              community.  In addition to the biologic data sets, physical properties of the
              water column, sediments, and sea ice will be used as environmental variables
              controlling distribution patterns.  Geographic Information System (GIS)
              software will be used to examine and graphically display relationships between
              predominant physical forcing processes and ecosystem productivity.  The
              resulting data set will allow examination of the effects of changing climate
              conditions on the distribution of biologic productivity patterns in the Arctic
              Ocean.  The results of this project will provide input for planning a large
              Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002.
