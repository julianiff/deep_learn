              Type:             SGER       Principal Investigator:    Andrew Hillier

              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program       
              sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of        the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal        investigator is
              Dr. Andrew Hillier at the University of Virginia. The        research is
              directed towards the development of a class of adaptive        materials whose
              binding characteristics respond to changes in their        local environment.
              These materials are particularly attractive in        chemical separation as
              their environmental sensitivity can be used as        either a signal of
              analyte binding or as a means of actively        controlling chemical affinity.
               Specifically, a series of        supramolecular  compounds will be constructed
              based on macrocylces of        cation-selective polyethers and anion-selective
              polyammoniums that are        tethered to redox-active metallocenes or
              optically-responsive        diazobenzenes.  The chemical affinity of the
              macrocycle will be tuned        by varying its chemical composition and ring
              size to adjust        selectivity for small, inorganic ions ranging from
              halides to        transition metals. The impact of optically
              electrochemically-induced        switching of the binding behavior in these
              materials will be        investigated. The separation characteristics of these
              macromolecules        will be examined in aqueous solutions while incorporated
              into liquid        and bilayer lipid membranes.               This work
              provides a novel class of materials with highly  controllable        chemical
              binding behavior and a switching mechanism that can be        externally
              triggered to actively control membrane-based separation        processes and
              design novel chemical sensing techniques. The work will        lead to the
              discovery and implementation of new materials that provide        a
              specifically controlled local environment for manipulation of        chemical
              affinity and transport properties.
