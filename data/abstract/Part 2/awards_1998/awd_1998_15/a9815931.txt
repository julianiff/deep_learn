Abstract    :
              The proposed program evaluation will be longitudinal study of the effects of an
              NSF-funded Teacher Enhancement Program entitled an "Industrial Partnership to
              Improve Mathematics and Science Education in Central Florida."  This project
              continues in perpetuity as the Lockheed Martin/UCF Academy for Mathematics and
              Science because the Academy is now funded through an endownment from the
              Lockheed Martin Corporation.  This in-depth, descriptive, mixed-method
              evaluation study will provide important information about the sustainability of
              teacher enhancement projects, provide information and guidance for ongoing data
              collection during other projects, and provide a model for approaches to
              evaluation of teacher enhancement projects.
