Abstract    :
              ECS-9815196  Srikant    The goal of this workshop is to bring together
              researchers who work on various aspects of communication networks, with the aim
              of facilitating an enchange of information between system theorists and the
              rest of the networks community.  Specifically, the workshop would bring
              together researchers working in the areas of control theory, signal processing
              , communications, computer science and operations research, from different
              institutions such as universities, industry, national laboratories and other
              government agencies to foster the creation of new research directions in the
              area of communication networks.  The emphasis of this workshop would be
              wireless networks, including physical layer phenomena, and congestion control,
              scheduling and pricing in high-speed networks such as the Internet and ATM
              networks.  A total of  about 80 people will be invited to the workshop, of
              which there will be about 15-20 speakers, with enough time for discussions. 
              The presentations will emphasize on an overview of the research area and open
              problems, thus promoting the goal of the workshop which is to set new research
              directions.
