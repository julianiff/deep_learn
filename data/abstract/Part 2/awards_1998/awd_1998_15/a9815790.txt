This award provides  NSF support to upgrade a number of
              aging Plymouth State College (PSC) meteorological computer systems used for
              Unidata software applications.   The specific components of this project are as
              follows:

     Replacement of a 7-year old RS6000 with new Pentium II class
              server,
     Replacement of three6-year olf Gatewary 486 PC's with Pentium II
              class machines, and
     Replacement of five Dell 486DX/100 systems with
              Pentium II's.

The server will replace a 1991 vintage RS6000 which recently
              became inoperative  and was not cost effective to repair.
