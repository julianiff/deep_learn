This award supports the PI, William Rose, and a graduate student
              from the Michigan Technological University and Game McGimsey of the Alaska
              Volcano Observatory in a collaboration with Hans F. Graf of the Max Planck
              Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.  The research focus is on
              combining a comprehensive data set, produced from observational data from three
              volcanic eruptions, with a new model for simulating volcanic plumes.  The
              observational data come from eruptions at Crater Peak/Mt. Spurr in Alaska, and
              include geophysical, radar, radiosonde, satellite, fallout, and ash data.  The
              new model, Active Tracer High Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) is the most
              sophisticated attempt yet to model a volcanic plume.  This is an
              interdisciplinary effort, and contact between the German atmospheric science
              group and the U.S. volcanological group is essential to the project.  The
              result of the collaboration will be an understanding of the influences and
              impact of volcanic emission on regional and global areas.  Ultimately, the new
              capabilities deriving from this project will improve our ability to forecast
              the hazardous effects of volcanic eruptions.
