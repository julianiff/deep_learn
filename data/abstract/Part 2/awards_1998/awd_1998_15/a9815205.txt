We investigate the effects of climate change on
              ecosystems and the resulting feedback effects on climate.   Overhead electric
              heaters are used to warm Rocky Mountain meadow  plots by the amount  expected
              from global warming next century.  Effects of climate change on soil
              microclimate, carbon and nitrogen cycling,  plant growth and flowering time,
              and species diversity are monitored.  Heating has increased the length of the
              growing season, altered the timing of flowering, increased the rate of nitrogen
              cycling,  caused sagebrush to expand at the expense of other plants, and caused
              a 20% decrease in soil carbon.   To extend  our knowledge of such effects, we
              are also investigating ecological trends in meadow plots that lie along a
              natural elevational and climate gradient.  The combined knowledge from heated
              plots and from the natural climate gradient is providing  a unified picture of
              ecosystem-climate interactions across a wide range of space and time scales.
