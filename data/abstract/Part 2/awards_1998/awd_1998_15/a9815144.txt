Abstract    :
              Robinson  9815144    The Gateways VII Conference, titled Reaching Out, brings
              together leaders form all the National Science Foundation funded comprehensive
              mathematics curriculum projects and the leaders from the more recently funded
              implementation projects.  The conference provides opportunities for these
              leaders to share information and experiences and address common problems that
              have surfaced as the materials are being implemented.  This edition of Gateways
              is hosted by COMPASS , the secondary school level implementation project at
              Ithaca College, Ithaca, NY.  A special feature of the conference is a
              presentation by and discussion with the leaders of the National Council of
              Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards 2000 Project, which is a project to
              revise the standards document issued by NCTM in 1989.
