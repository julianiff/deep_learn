Is nitrogen nitrogen? Ecosystem impacts of anthropogenic N
              sources on algal blooms, hypoxia, and biogeochemical cycling in the Neuse River
              estuary, NC


Nitrogen (N) limitation is a common feature of estuaries
              worldwide.  Excessive man-made N loading from unprecedented urban, agricultural
              and industrial growth in the Neuse River estuary watershed has led to
              accelerating primary production (eutrophication), including harmful algal
              blooms.  Blooms produce large amounts of organic matter, which fuels excessive
              oxygen consumption.  This condition, hypoxia, reduces habitats,  causes
              disease, suffocates fish and shellfish and disrupts ecosystem function. 
              National expansion of hypoxia is of prime concern.  "Nitrogen is nitrogen" is
              commonly assumed when relating N inputs to ecosystem structure and function. 
              We hypothesize that diverse algal groups use various anthropogenic inorganic
              and organic N sources differentially, leading to distinct algal bloom
              responses, food web alteration, oxygen depletion,  water quality and habitat
              changes in the estuary.  The responses of natural algal communities to specific
              N compounds and their impacts on altered estuarine function  (e.g., hypoxia and
              nurient cycling) is the focus of this research.
