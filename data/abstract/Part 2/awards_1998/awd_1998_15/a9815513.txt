Abstract    :
              9815513  Leaman    Funds are provided to facilitate an international research
              planning workshop for the   "Intra-Americas Sea Science Initiative (IASI),  
              the purpose of which is to advance   scientific understanding of complex
              environmental problems in the Intra-Americas Sea   (IAS) of the Caribbean Sea
              (and by extension the Gulf of Mexico).  Four principal   themes have been
              developed within IASI: 1) Air-Sea-Land Interactions in the IAS; 2)   Larval
              Recruitment Pathways, Adult Productivity, Biological-Physical Linkages and  
              Their Influences on IAS Fisheries; 3) Interconnections and Sustainability of
              Coastal   Environments and Resources; 4) A Regional Global Observing System for
              the IAS. The   research planning workshop will produce a set of research plans
              to address scientific   problems in these theme areas, and it will bring
              together representatives from U.S. and   foreign research institutions and
              support agencies to coordinate future efforts in the   region.
