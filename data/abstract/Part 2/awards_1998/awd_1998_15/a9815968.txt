Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This study will provide timely evaluation of a new family of imaging
              devices for near-infrared wavelengths developed by the Rockwell International
              Science Center.  Some early tests show that the new detectors are capable of
              high-speed read out and very low noise (about 1 electron).  It is expected that
              as these devices mature that they will be ideal for astronomical adaptive
              optics (AO) applications involving wavefront sensors and tip/tilt sensors where
              high frame rates and low noise are required simultaneously.

Evaluation of
              the devices will be done at the UCLA Infrared Imaging Detector Lab.  As newer
              devices become available with multiple outputs (up to 32), the electronics data
              acquisition system will be upgraded to operate at higher speeds.
