NSF Planning Workshop --- Robotics at the Turn of the Century:
              Challenges and Opportunities Ahead

This is a standard workshop award.  This
              workshop will be held currently with the 9th International Symposium on
              Robotics Research ((ISRR), October 9-12, 1999. The overall mandate is to
              re-examine how to best align the efforts of the robotics research community
              with the needs of a discipline to achieve its long promised but still delayed
              social impact. This mandate fits well within the theme of the 9th ISRR,
              designed to help focus and articulate the next decades' intellectual agenda in
              the field of robotics. At the close of the 20th century, it seems well worth
              such an exercise in the ensemble of a broad coalition of general stakeholders
              in the future of the field. These include corporate managers, academic
              researchers, government representatives, and perhaps even some observers such
              as science/technology reporters. A list of topics to be discussed includes 1)
              markets,  2) materials (of robots) , 3) modeling (of environments), 4)
              algorithms, 5) human augmentation, and 6) zoomorphism.  Findings of the
              workshop, including position papers and critical reactions they received at the
              overview forums, will comprise the substance of a public report  to the NSF and
              a website turned over to the NSF for appropriate wider dissemination.
