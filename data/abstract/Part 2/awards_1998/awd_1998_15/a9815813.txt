	One of the largest biomes in the continental United
              States, the semi-arid rangeland, has been dramatically altered by human
              activities over the past 150 years. The most widespread and conspicuous
              vegetation change has been the expansion of woody plant at the expense of
              grasses, sedges and forbs. This research will explore the following general
              questions in the montane meadows of the Sierrra Nevada where the expansion of
              sagebrush has occured: 1) Are any ecological processes that can explain the
              current patterns of sagebrush and herbs? 2) What are the current trends of
              change in these communities and 3) What are the barriers to the recovery of the
              herbaceous species? This will be done with a combination of experimental and
              observational studies to examine the interactions between sagebrush and
              herbaceous species. The experiments will involve large cattle exclosures,
              smaller gopher exclosures, removal of vegetation (clipping) and water
              manipulations. In addition, experiments will also be conducted in a series of
              meadow restoration plots that are in their initial stages of establishment.
              These experiments along with the detailed observational studies will enable the
              PI to elucidate the factors that constrain herbaceous species within the
              expanding sagebrush community. It is hoped that not only will the proposed
              research contribute a solid ecological framework to current restoration plans
              for this system, but it also will help address the more widespread problem of
              using general ecological theory to site-specific restoration issues.
