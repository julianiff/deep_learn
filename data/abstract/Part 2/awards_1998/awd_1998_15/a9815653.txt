This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Operator Algebras and Applications, to be
              held in Fukuoka, Japan from July 5-9, l999.  The co-organizers are Professors
              Bruce Blackadar at the University of Nevada, Reno and Hideki Kosaki at Kyushu
              University in Japan.  Operator algebras is an exceedingly important area of
              analysis.  Very significant breakthroughs have been made in the last decade
              that not only increase our understanding of the field, but also demonstrate the
              wide range of applications of the subject to topology, geometry, and
              mathematical physics.  Much of this progress has been made by investigators in
              the U.S. and Japan.

The seminar program will be composed of three main
              categories.  These are:  1) theory of subfactors and related topics;  2)
              classification and structure of C* -Algebras; and  
3) applications of
              operator algebras to geometry, topology, and physics.  
Seminar organizers
              have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants
              and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this
              field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the
              stage for future collaborative projects.
