DiStefano
This award supports the PI, Rosanne DiStefano, a
              postdoctoral, and a graduate student from the Smithsonian Astrophysical
              Observatory in a collaboration with Jochen Greiner of the Institute for
              Astrophysics in Potsdam, Germany.  The research focus is on discovering new
              sources of super-soft x-rays (x-rays close to the ultra-violet part of the
              spectrum) and testing a new close-binary supersoft source model.  The PI is an
              expert in such models, and the German group is known for its facilities, and
              the German PI is credited with playing a leading role in the discovery of
              super-soft x-ray systems .  A large amount of new and planned data will provide
              strong tests for the new model which will then be of use to the entire
              astrophysics community.
