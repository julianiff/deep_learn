              will be provided for young researchers and academic invited speakers to the ESF
              (European Science Foundation)/NSF Symposium on "Aerosols for Nanostructured
              Materials and Devices", Edinburgh, Scotland, September 12, 1998.  This
              symposium is immediately prior to the 5th International Aerosol Conference.  It
              will present the most recent research results obtained by both parties,
              evaluate trends and opportunities in the field of synthesis and processing into
              materials and devices of nanoparticles produced via aerosols.  Areas of
              relevance will include functional nanostructures in ceramics and electronics,
              optical and opto-electronic devices.  The meeting will bring together European
              scientists, particularly from the ESF NANO-network (Vapor-phase Synthesis and
              Processing of Nanoparticle Materials), and US scientists, particularly those
              with NSF funded projects.  An emphasis is on connection between aerosol science
              and material science community in the area of nanotechnology.  Twelve young
              researchers from US researchers and ten from Europe have been selected for
              participation and will present papers.  A purpose of the meeting is to
              facilitate the establishment of long term cooperation among researchers in both
              regions.
