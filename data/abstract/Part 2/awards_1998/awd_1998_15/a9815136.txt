Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative program to bring together glaciology and
              structural geology to tackle two related cross-disciplinary issues.  The
              project will investigate the geological mechanisms known to operate in
              anisotropic rocks that may also generate stratigraphic disruptions in polar
              ice.  A series of analytical and semi-analytical models to explore conditions
              for and onset of folding, kinking, fabric striping, and shear banding in polar
              ice sheets will be developed using linearization and perturbation methods.  A
              fundamental goal is a new ability to estimate the maximum depths of undisturbed
              ice for ice cores in various settings.  The bulk anisotropic properties of
              polar ice will also be incorporated in a new finite element dynamic ice flow
              model.  One goal is to extend the models of layer disruption processes to large
              strains.  This model will also be used to improve the predicted depth-age
              relationships for ice core sites, and to produce improved calculations of the
              thinning functions needed to convert measured layer thicknesses to past
              accumulation rates for deep ice that has a strongly anisotropic bulk
              fabric.
