Abstract    :
              The investigators will examine solar wind interactions with non-magnetic solar
              system bodies such as Venus, Mars, Titan, and various comets. Research in this
              area contributes to a broad, comparative understanding of planetary ionospheres
              and induced magnetospheres that form on inherently non-magnetic bodies.  The
              main effort is theoretical modeling of this interaction using several
              complementary techniques. Primary emphasis of the research will be collisional
              interactions between plasmas and neutral gases and the evolution of plasma
              distribution functions in induced magnetospheres.
