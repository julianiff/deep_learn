This two-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              biomaterials involves David L. Kaplan of Tufts University, Richard Gross of
              Polytechnic University, Phillipe Guerin and Sandrine Cammas of the University
              of Paris, Val de Marne.  Their research is focused on the synthesis of
              polyester using enzymatic polymerization of lactones.  The US team brings to
              this collaboration expertise in the use of enzymes to catalyze polymerization
              reactions, in particular, lactone reactions.  This is complemented by French
              expertise in the preparation of complex monomers by both chemical and enzymatic
              methods.

Polyesters are an important family of polymers for a wide range of
              commodity and biomedical applications.  The polymerization of lactones to form
              polyesters is a chemical process and the ability to synthesize lactones by
              traditional chemical methods is limited.  The investigators propose to test new
              synthetic options, including those developed by the French team.  Their
              combined effort will advance understanding of enzyme-based lactone
              polymerization, an area of interest to both the medical community and polymer
              scientists.
