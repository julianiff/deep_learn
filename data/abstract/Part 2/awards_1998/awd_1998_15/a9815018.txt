Abstract    :
              The investigators perform a systematic study of issues related to the tradeoffs
              between dimension and rate in vector quantization.  They investigate the
              compression gains achievable by simultaneous quantization of a block of data
              over scalar quantization.  Theoretical limits on the savings, rates of
              convergence, and algorithms achieving them are sought for worst-case as well as
              average-case performance criteria. Special consideration is given to
              "combinatorial" distortion measures that attain only two values: zero or
              infinity. These measures allow only certain types of errors and are important
              in applications where some mistakes cannot be tolerated. These measures are
              simpler to analyze, yet display many of the complexities of general measures.
