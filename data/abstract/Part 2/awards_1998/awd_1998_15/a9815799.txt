Multiple ecological factors
              influence the dynamics of populations, the structure of communities and the
              functioning of ecosystems.  One mechanism to evaluate the multiple levels that
              influence the distribution of species among sites is to focus on the
              relationship between environmental gradients and the traits of species that
              occupy different sites along gradients.  This project would use this approach
              by testing the predictions of a set of mechanistic models by combining
              experimental approaches and recently developed statistical methods, the 4th
              corner technique.  It will conduct long-term experiments in mesocosms that
              manipulate nutrients, light and trophic structure to investigate how
              ecological, morphological and stoichiometric traits are correlated with these
              factors.  Information will be collected to relate patterns in 4th corner
              matrices directly to the predictions and assumptions of two major alternative
              hypotheses for the regulation of  aquatic food webs in ponds.
