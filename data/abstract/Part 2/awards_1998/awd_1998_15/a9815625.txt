This award supports a two year collaborative research
              project between Professor William Fairbank of Stanford University and Professor
              Mitsuhiro Miyajima of Fukui University in Japan.  The researchers will be
              undertaking a study of the development of a method of detecting single Ba+-136
              ions which are created by rare double beta decay of Xe-136 atoms in liquid
              xenon.  The unique combination of decay and single ion detection technologies
              is expected to make possible a background-free search for double beta decay in
              Xe-136.  In the long term, a two-orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity
              is projected.  Then it is expected that two-neutrino double beta decay of
              XE-136 will be observed for the first time and that, with the improved
              sensitivity for zero-neutrino decay, an electron neutrino mass limit around
              0.01 eV may be reached.  

This project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The
              U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of small optical signals and the
              Japanese have the nuclear expertise in this area.  A positive result for
              neutrinoless double beta decay would imply new physics beyond the Standard
              Model and may help explain astrophysical mysteries such as the solar neutrino
              and cosmic ray neutrino deficits and the composition of dark matter in the
              universe.   This research advances international human resources through the
              participation of graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and
              technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote
              international understanding and cooperation.
