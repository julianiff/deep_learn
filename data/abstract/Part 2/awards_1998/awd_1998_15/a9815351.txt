This award supports Drs. Youxue Zhang and Rebecca Lange and two
              postdoctoral or graduate students from the University of Michigan in a
              collaboration with Francois Holtz and Harold Behres of the Institute for
              Mineralogy at the University of Hannover, Germany.  The research funded by this
              award will focus on thermodynamic and transport properties of silicate melts
              and glasses, especially as affected by dissolved H2O.  Understanding the
              effects of dissolved H2O in silicate melts on such properties as viscosity,
              density, crystallization temperature, and diffusivity is critical to a complete
              understanding of geological processes.  Because of the complementary expertise
              and facilities of the German and U.S. groups, and their interest in different
              aspects of the same research problems, this collaboration will be of great
              benefit to both sides.  The research program will investigate many new areas of
              collaboration that will increase our knowledge of geological and volcanic
              phenomena.
