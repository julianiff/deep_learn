This award will support participants at a Conference on
              Advances in 
Control of Nonlinear Distributed Parameter Systems to be held at
              
Texas A&M University from October 29-31, 1999. The conference 
will focus on
              discussing, examining, reviewing, and identifying the 
state-of-the-art,
              questions, issues, challenges, opportunities, and new 
directions in the
              research of control systems governed by nonlinear 
partial differential
              equations.  This area is driven by technological 
developments in smart
              materials, active actuators and sensors, as well as 
by advances in the
              mathematical theory of nonlinear partial differential 
equations and dynamical
              systems.  Major themes will include both 
theory and applications, including
              smart materials, nonlinear plates and 
shells in structural control, control
              of fluids, nonlinear functional-
analytic and partial differential equations
              techniques, and chaotic 
distributed parameter systems.
