There is a real need to link small-scale patch-based
              field studies with large landscape regional studies. This project will allow
              the PI to continue his studies of Microtus pennsylvanicus as the focal species
              for testing patch dynamics and source/sink models.  This experiments use
              replicated microlandscapes where the ratio of good:poor habitats and dispersal
              rates are under experimental control. This is accomplished by adding
              supplemental food to a subset of the patches to create good/poor habitats and
              the dispersal rates are manipulated by either mowing or not mowing between
              patches. The model system outlined in this proposal has the potential to study
              habitat-specific demography of patches of differing quality within linked
              landscapes, thus allowing the connections between field studies and landscapes
              to be rigorously examined.
