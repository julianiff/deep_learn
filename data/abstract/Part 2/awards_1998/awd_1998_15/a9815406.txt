The Department of Earth and Atmopsheric Sciences at the
              University at Albany, State University of New York, will be installing a
              computer teaching Laboratory for graduate and undergraduate education during
              the 1998-99 academic year.  The student workstations for the classroom are
              being purchased with combined Department and University funds.  The Department
              would like to include a large UNIX server to facilitate use of
              Unidata-supported software for the interactive analysis of meteorological
              observations and model output.  Current Departmental computing facilities have
              been well used in graduate research and education, and in undergraduate
              independent study and extracurricular activities.  The Department now wants to
              expand these capabilities for meteorological  research and classroom teaching. 
              To provide students with an up-to-date eucation and expose them to
              state-of-the-art research facilities, the Department must provide experience in
              using UNIX systems and available software.
