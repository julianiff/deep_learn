Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are twofold.  First, stereoselection at the steady
              state, a conceptually new method wherein reaction topology dictates
              stereochemical outcome, will be used to develop new synthetic methodology. 
              Second, a prochiral auxiliary approach will be used to produce chiral anilides.
               An international component provided by the US-Japan Program enhances the
              proposed research.

With this Accomplishment-Based renewal award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the U.S.- Japan Cooperative Research
              Program are supporting the research of Dr. Dennis P. Curran of the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Curran will focus his
              work on developing stereoselection in organic reactions.  The ability to
              control stereochemistry in synthesis is of fundamental importance in and beyond
              the discipline of organic chemistry and into such areas as the production of
              pharmaceuticals.  A collaboration fostered by the US-Japan Program will
              increase the potential of the proposed work.
