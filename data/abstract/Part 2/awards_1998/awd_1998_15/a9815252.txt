This
              project will use biologic data collected in 1994 on the joint US-Canadian
              Arctic Ocean Section cruise in the Arctic Ocean to verify an ecosystem model
              for the Chukchi Sea.  The model will focus on the role of pelagic organisms in
              the ecosystem.  The results will be used to examine the export of inorganic
              nutrients, particulate and dissolved organic matter from the continental shelf
              into the deep basin.  By understanding the factors that regulate biological
              processes on the shelf, the model will facilitate prediction of the effects of
              changes in physical parameters such as climate on the magnitude and fate of
              shelf production and exchange of nutrients between shelf and basin.  The
              results of this project will provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field
              program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic
              area.
