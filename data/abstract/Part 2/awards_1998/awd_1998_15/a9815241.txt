This
              project will manage a project office for the Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI)
              project to be conducted in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of the Arctic Ocean.
              The project office will facilitate meetings of the Executive Committee and
              funded investigators, coordinate the compilation of an Implementation Plan for
              the Phase 2 field program, provide information about the project as it
              develops, and facilitate the publication of data summaries of completed
              projects.  The SBI Project Office is a critical activity for coordinating
              results from contributing investigators and international projects with
              complimentary goals, planning activities for the field work phase of the
              project, and representing SBI at meetings with logistics providers.  Annual
              meetings of the participating investigators and investigators in other arctic
              oceanographic research programs will be conducted.
