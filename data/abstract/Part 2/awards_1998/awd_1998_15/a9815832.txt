This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              fluid mechanics and turbulent flow involves Lance Collins of Pennsylvania State
              University and Iskender Gokalp of the Laboratoire de Combustion et Systemes
              Reactifs in Orleans, France.  They propose to collaborate on a detailed
              comparison between direct numerical simulations and controlled experiments of
              the distribution of a dilute suspension of aerosol particles in isotropic
              turbulence. Turbulent aerosols arise in a broad range of technological flows
              (aerosol powder manufacturing, spray combustion) and natural flows (raindrop
              and cloud formation; aerosol transport in the atmosphere).

The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in numerical simulations. 
              This is complemented by the French investigator's experimental expertise.  The
              French laboratory has a facility capable of generating stationary isotropic
              turbulence in a cube with numerical simulations of the same geometry.  The
              coupled experiments and numerical simulations will advance understanding of how
              particle distribution affects aerosol processes such as coagulation,
              agglomeration, vaporization that control the evolution of the particle or drop
              size distribution.
