This two-year award in support of U.S.-France
              collaborative research in theoretical physics involves Daniel Boyanovsky of the
              University of Pittsburgh and H. J. de Vega at the Laboratoire de Physique
              Theorique et Haute Energies, Universite de Paris VI and VII.  They propose to
              study potential experimental signatures associated with nonequilibrium
              processes in quark-gluon plasma and chiral phase transitions.  The project is
              related to the new generation of ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders, the
              Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
              Brookhaven.  These experimental facilities will provide an unprecedented range
              of energy densities to probe the quark-gluon plasma and chiral phase
              transitions.  The proposal takes advantage of complementary expertise of the US
              and French investigators in nuclear physics theory.  Their project provides
              theoretical underpinning for proposed experiments at CERN and Brookhaven.
