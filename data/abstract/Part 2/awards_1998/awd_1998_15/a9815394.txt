The Histeridae is a
              diverse family of approximately 4,000 species of predatory beetles that occupy
              a wide variety of ecological niches.  All species within the subfamily
              Hetaeriinae are guests of ant or termite colonies and have evolved in
              association with a wide variety of hosts.  This subfamily is one of the most
              diverse ant- and termite-associated insect taxa, with approximately 315
              described species.  The project is focused on field research on the poorly
              known ant-associated genus Mesynodites, with about 55 described species and at
              least twice that number of undescribed species.  The project will bring
              together all distributional and host information on the genus complex and make
              it available to interested researchers via an internet project website.  The
              database will be important for taxonomic and biodiversity suties, and may also
              be used as a source of information by researchers conducting studies of the
              evoution of ant and termite associations.  Field expeditions to poorly
              collected regions of South America will be conducted to procure specimens, and
              to fill gaps in distributional and host data.
