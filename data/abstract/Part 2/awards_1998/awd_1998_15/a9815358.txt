This award supports the PI, Charles Fadley, and a postdoctoral
              student from the University of California-Davis in a collaboration with
              Wolfgang Schattke of the Institute for Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics at
              the University of Kiel, Germany.  The research focus is on theoretical and
              computational analysis of photoemission that incorporates the response of
              electrons in an atom's core as well as in the outer shell.  The project
              combines the complementary expertise of the German group in outer-electron
              emission theory with the U.S. groups expertise in core-electron excitation
              phenomena.  The results of the research will be of great importance to the
              development of advanced materials for application in many technology fields. 
              There is also extensive involvement of junior researchers in the international
              exchange of personnel.
