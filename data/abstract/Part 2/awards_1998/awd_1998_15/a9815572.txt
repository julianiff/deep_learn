This award supports the PI, Michael McNallan, the co-PI, Yuri
              Gogotsi, and several graduate students from the University of Illinois -
              Chicago in a collaboration with Klaus Nickel of the Department of Applied
              Mineralogy at the University of Tuebingen, Germany.  The research focus is on
              the discovery of new methods for synthesis of carbon coatings on the surface of
              silicon-carbide.  The collaboration will allow the comparison of two different
              techniques for the extraction of metals from carbides--one using halogens at
              Chicago and one using supercritical water at Tuebingen.  The comparison will
              then make it possible to increase our understanding of carbon growth
              mechanisms.  The coatings developed as a result of this research will find uses
              in new protective coatings for sensors and tools, intermediate thin films for
              further chemical vapor deposition of diamond, molecular membranes for sensors,
              et al.  U.S. students will have the opportunity to participate in research in
              one of the leading European laboratories in this scientific area.
