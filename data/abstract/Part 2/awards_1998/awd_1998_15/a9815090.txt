The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the
              elemental composition,
redox speciation, and the molecular nature of iron and
              manganese oxides that are formed at oxic/anoxic transitions in aquatic systems.
               In particular, we are primarily interested in obtaining nanoscale information
              on the morphology, structure, and reactivity of environmental particles as well
              as molecular information on the mineral phases/assemblages that comprise these
              particles.  Our central hypothesis is that the existence of mixed valence
              states of Fe and Mn governs the reactivity of these authigenic iron and
              managanese phases.  This investigation will focus on particles formed at the
              semi-permanent oxic/anoxic transition present in a small lake characterized by
              a biogenic meromixis: Paul Lake (MI).

To reach these objectives we shall use
              a combination of microscopic and spectroscopic methods.  Paul Lake particles
              will be collected and prepared for microscopic observations using SEM and TEM. 
              The elemental composition of individual particles will be determined, at the
              nano-scale, using either EDS or EELS.  Concurrently, the changes of the local
              molecular environment of selected metals in the particles will be probed using
              in situ X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure XAFS techniques.

The expected result
              of this research is a better characterization of the particles
that are formed
              at oxic/anoxic transitions in aquatic systems.  The chemical composition, redox
              speciation, and molecular structure of these particles will provide valuable
              information for predicting the fate of metals and exotic chemicals that bind
              selectively to these particulate phases.
