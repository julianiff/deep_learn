This three-year award will support US-France
              collaborative research among Nicholas Cozzarelli of the University of
              California, Berkeley, David Bensimon and Vincent Croquette at the Ecole Normale
              Superieure in Paris, France.  The objective of the collaboration is to study
              the interaction of single topoisomerases with DNA.  Topoisomerases are
              ubiquitous and essential enzymes that solve the topological problems that
              accompany DNA replication, transcription, Chromatin assembly, recombination and
              chromosome segregation by introducing transient breaks into the DNA.  The
              investigators will study the mechanics and dynamics of both types of
              topoisomerases and DNA replication intermediates.  They will use the technique
              of single DNA manipulations to study these interactions.

The US investigator
              brings to this collaboration expertise in topoisomerases and the topological
              properties of DNA.  This will be advanced by the French investigators'
              expertise in DNA manipulation and their apparatus, which allows for twisting,
              stretching and mechanical measurements on single DNA molecules in a controlled
              environment.  Proteins, ionic buffers, and temperature can be changed at will
              using this apparatus.  The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding
              of the dynamics and mechanics of these topical enzymes.
