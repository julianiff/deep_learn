	Nitrogen inputs from watersheds to estuaries
              are increasing due to coastal watershed development.  A better understanding of
              the fate of nitrogen in estuaries is needed to improve management of coupled
              watersheds and estuaries.  We propose to determine the fate of
              watershed-derived nitrate in estuaries by use of a nitrogen cycle tracer. The
              tracer makes it possible to measure how nitrogen moves throughout the ecosystem
              from prey to predators and from the water to sediments.  We will study how
              river discharge affects the nitrogen cycle by comparing how the nitrogen tracer
              moves in estuaries during high and low river discharge.  Likewise comparison of
              nitrogen flow in estuaries with and without extensive tidal flats will show how
              the overall shape of estuaries affects the nitrogen cycle. The nitrogen cycle
              data from these tracer experiments will be used to improve and test models that
              predict the fate of watershed-derived nitrogen in estuaries.
