Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this study is to improve the capability of predicting
              ionospheric weather by improving the basic understanding of the climatology
              (long-term variations) of the F-region ionosphere.  This objective will be
              accomplished through a detailed analysis of the seasonal and solar cycle
              variations of the ionospheric peak electron density (NmF2).  Quantification of
              the reasons for the long term variations is a necessary prelude to solving the
              problem of predicting the day-to-day variability (weather).  Of primary concern
              will be the determination of the dependence of observed NmF2 on both the daily
              and long-term solar activity indices (F10.7, F10.7A).  Currently, this very
              basic relationship is not well known.  The causes of the observed density
              variations will be explored with the aid of the theoretical ionosphere model,
              known as the FLIP model, which is capable of utilizing key ionospheric
              measurements as constraints.  With the aid of a newly developed algorithm to
              adjust the model neutral densities, comparison of the observed and modeled
              electron density variations will enable the determination of the changes in the
              neutral densities or photoionization rates that may be required to reproduce
              the observations. 

This study will lead to improved forecasting of
              ionospheric behavior by determining the underlying physical causes of the main
              variations in ionospheric electron density.
