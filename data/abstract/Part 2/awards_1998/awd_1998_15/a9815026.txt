Abstract    :
              This project will conduct a longitudinal study of a naturally occurring
              experimental design resulting from a district-initiated project to supply a
              cohort of 40 incoming freshmen and 20 teachers with laptop computers.  The
              district, Union City, has committed three years of funding to this project and
              will add 40 students and teachers in years two and three.   Through the use of
              ethnographic methods, the project will examine the relationships between and
              among school reform efforts in general, the application of technology, and the
              overall changes in school achievement.  The study will focus on student
              learning, teacher beliefs and practices, administrator roles and parent
              involvement.   Overall, the study seeks to show when long term investment in
              technology is partnered with reform of curriculum and teaching.  The findings
              can be used by national, state and local policy makers.
