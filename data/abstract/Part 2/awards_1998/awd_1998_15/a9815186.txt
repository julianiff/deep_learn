Abstract    :
              9815186

Solid mineral formations composed of methane molecules caged in a
              lattice of water molecules (clathrates) are found in marine sediments around
              the world under conditions where dissolved methane is at the saturation point,
              hydrostatic pressures are sufficiently high, and water temperatures are low. 
              Because of the exquisite temperature-pressure sensitivity of the clathrate
              structure (they spontaneously breakdown to release gaseous methane when brought
              to the sea surface or to shallower water depths) as well as their global
              abundance, this team of investigators will conduct studies to determine what
              happens after methane is released from the clathrate structure and rises into
              the marine water column.  Their research goals are (1) to trace the source and
              determine methane inventory and flux to the water column, (2) to determine the
              fate of this methane in the water column, and (3) to determine relationships
              between methane inventories and oxidation rates with regional geophysical
              features.  As participants in a much larger international effort studying
              methane clathrates in the Cascadia accretionary Prism off the coast of Oregon,
              these investigators will be carrying out studies that promise to relate the
              occurrence of these seafloor features to the bigger picture of the cycling of
              carbon in the sea and to the role of the ocean in regulating methane and carbon
              dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere.
