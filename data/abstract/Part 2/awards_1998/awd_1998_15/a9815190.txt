The well-lit surface waters of the world
              ocean is a region of material exchange with the atmosphere as well as a region
              characterized by a myriad of chemical reactions, many of which are driven by
              sunlight.  In this project, the investigators will quantify and model the diel
              cycling of carbonyl sulfide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen peroxide in the
              upper ocean.  All three species are generated by solar photolysis of colored
              dissolved organic matter.  High resolution determinations of these three
              species will be made at sea together with appropriate optical, biological, and
              meterological measurements.  Laboratory experiments and mathematical models
              would be used to constrain the jpossible mechanisms of interconversion adn to
              estimate unmeasured fluxes.  The investigators expect to achieve an
              unprecedented understanding of the chemistry of these globally-important
              chemical species in the sea as well as their exchange between the ocean and
              lower atmosphere.
