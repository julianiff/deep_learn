Abstract    :
              Little Rock Lake in northern Wisconsin has been the site of a whole-lake
              acidification experiment since 1983.  The lake was divided into a reference
              basin that was left unmodified and a treatment basin that was acidified between
              1985 and 1990.  During the three, 2-year phases of increasing acidification,
              the PIs documented a wide range of responses to the acid additions.  Since
              1991, the PIs  have been evaluating the natural capacity of the lake to recover
              from the direct and indirect effects of acidification.  The lake has largely
              returned to pre-acidified chemical conditions.  By spring 1995, the lake's pH
              was close to the 6.1 value that occurred prior to the manipulation.  In
              contrast, some biological characteristics of the lake exhibited a substantially
              slower recovery.  In particular, through 1996, the taxonomic composition of the
              treatment basin's zooplankton community remained different from the community
              occurring in the reference basin.  By 1997, however, there were signs that the
              zooplankton were beginning to be similar in the treatment and reference basins.
               This project will complete the PIs evaluation of Little Rock Lake's recovery
              and test the hypothesis that the treatment basin's zooplankton community will
              be essentially the same as that in the reference basin in 1999 and 2000, 9 and
              10 years following the last acid additions.  The PIs will also evaluate an
              analytical technique to distinguish whether the zooplankton community in the
              treatment basin has formed a long-standing community distinctly different from
              that in the reference basin or if there was a delayed response in its recovery.
              Large-scale experiments such as the Little Rock Lake project operate at an
              interface between applied and theoretical ecology.  Completing the PIs
              evaluation of the lake's recovery will allow the PIs to complete the 
              documentation of Little Rock Lake's full range of reactions to acidification
              and to evaluate some of the basic processes that control long-term dynamics in
              lakes.
