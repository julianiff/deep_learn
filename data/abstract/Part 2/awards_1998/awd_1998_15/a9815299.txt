This project is an exploratory investigation of the effect
              of an external melt gradient on the behavior of peridotite melting.  Peridotite
              melting experiments will be undertaken in a piston cylinder apparatus at 1 GPa
              with the peridotite in diffusive contact with a silica undersaturated melt (in
              a sense, simulating a melt conduit-peridotite interface). The motivation for
              these experiments stems from two fundamental discrepancies between natural
              peridotite samples and experimental results.  First, abyssal peridotites,
              inferred to be residues of MORB generation, record that orthopyroxene
              contributes more to melting than clinopyroxene, an observation inconsistent
              with experimental results that predict clinopyroxene to dominate the melting
              mode. Second, melt compositions observed within peridotite xenoliths are
              dominated by silica rich (55-65%) melts, not basaltic melts as would be
              predicted by peridotite melting experiments.  If an external melt gradient is
              able to influence how peridotite melts and thus explains these observations;
              future directions in experimental melt determinations and numerical modeling of
              mantle melting would be profoundly affected.  The potential influence of
              external melt gradients also will be evaluated through further analyses of
              peridotite xenolith-melt relations including examining in-situ partitioning of
              trace elements between melt and clinopyroxene by ion probe analysis.  This
              exploratory study is particularly timely given the rapidly changing state of
              ideas regarding the genesis of igneous rocks based on both experiments and
              observations.
