This three-year award will support US-France collaborative
              research between L. Mario Amzel of Johns Hopkins University's School of
              Medicine and Alberto Podjarny of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg,
              France.  The objective of their research is to develop methods (algorithms) and
              computational tools for the refinement, analysis, and modeling of protein
              structures that are obtained by using very high-resolution X-ray
              crystallographic data.  These new tools are needed to take advantage of high
              intensity synchrotron radiation sources and very sensitive detectors. These
              advanced facilities and equipment have created opportunities to study
              biomolecules more accurately than ever.  The computations will be performed in
              cooperation with Dr. Raul Cachau of the National Cancer Institute's  Biomedical
              Supercomputer Center.

Dr. Amzel brings to this collaboration expertise in
              crystallographic structure determination and refinement.  This is complemented
              by the expertise of the French investigator, who is a computational
              crystallographer.  Their joint effort will advance the ability to refine
              crystal structures through the development of new computational tools.
