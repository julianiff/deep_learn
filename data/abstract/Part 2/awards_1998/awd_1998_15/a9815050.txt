Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9815050  WALTERS    All Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) have an evaluator that studies the university/industry
              interaction occurring.  This evaluation activity will study the
              university/industry interactions occurring at the University of Arizona I/UCRC
              for Microcontamination, the State University of New York at Buffalo I/UCRC for
              Biosurfaces, the New Jersey Institute of Technology I/UCRC for Hazardous Waste
              Management, Queen's University of Belfast I/UCRC for Environmental Research
              Corporation/Engineering Research Center (NSF) for Environmentally Benign
              Semi-Conductors at the University of Arizona.  The three-year study will focus
              on the university/industry interaction of a joint project, "Detection and
              Control of Microcontamination in Ultrapure Water," that all five centers are
              involved in.
