Title:
              Climate, Ecosystems, Infectious Diseases and Health


 The proposed work
              will review the role of climate variability in determining human health status
              through its influence on the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. The
              implications of this work has a longer-term climate change will be explored.
              The study will also assess the prospects for developing early warning and
              surveillance systems designed to diminish or prevent the climate-related spread
              of infectious diseases. The work is important because it will result in an
              important guiding document for public policy in climate-health related issues.
