Abstract    :
              98-15183  Purdy    The Triangle Coalition manages the Albert Einstein
              Distinguished Educator Fellowships Program to give highly qualified K-12
              matheamtics and science teachers an opportunity to spend a school year in the
              Washington, DC metropolitan are to serve as a "teacher voice" with various
              federal agencies and Congress.  Recently, federal agencies such as NASA, the US
              Department of Education, the US Department of Energy, and the National
              Institutes of Health have hosted Einstein Fellows.  During the 1997-1998 school
              year, NSF hosted a fellow.  While in the agencies, teachers have worked on
              several initiatives of national importance such as follow-up to the third
              International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Presidential
              Awards Program of NSF.  In addition to serving in federal agencies, Fellows
              engage in ongoing seminars and programs, managed by the Triangle Coalition,
              throughout their time in Washington.      To become an Einstein Fellow,
              teachers submit a written application and then undergo an interview process in
              Washington.  The interview panel is composed of current fellows and
              representatives of federal agencies.  Those selected as finalists are then
              placed.  This project will place a former Presidential Awardee as an Einstein
              Fellow at the National Science Foundation, to work on the Presidential Awards
              Program, and other teacher enhancement efforts.
