Abstract    :
              Dr. Mak will investigate several aspects of the effects of certain diabatic
              processes on the nature and evolution of baroclinic waves in cases of marine
              cyclogenesis.  He also will explore characteristics of the so-called "storm
              tracks" over the oceans in the Northern Hemisphere.   His approach is to look
              at the nonlinear dynamics.   Specifically, he will look at (1) the effect of
              surface sensible heat flux on large-scale baroclinic waves, (2) the life cycle
              of diabatically destabilized short baroclinic waves, (3) the interaction
              between surface fluxes and moist convection and the combined effect on
              baroclinic waves, and (4) the nature of the observed mid-winter suppression of
              the Pacific storm track in the Northern Hemisphere.  The primary tools for the
              research are a hierarchy of models of varying complexity.  

All of these
              topics are important for better understanding the nature of marine storms and
              ultimately improving mid-latitude forecasting.
