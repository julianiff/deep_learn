Tsoukalas
This award supports the PI, Lefteri Tsoukalas and two
              graduate students from Purdue University in a collaboration with George
              Tsatsaronis of the Institute for Energy Engineering at the Technical University
              of Berlin, Germany.  The research focus is to pursue sound methodologies for
              minimizing electricity production costs in the newly deregulated, highly
              competitive, and environmentally constrained electricity markets by combining
              state-of-the-art thermoeconomic analysis and knowledge-based approaches. 
              Significant benefits will be derived from integrating thermoeconomic analysis
              methods with knowledge-based approaches, including expert systems, neurofuzzy
              systems and hypermedia.  Important research, educational, and technological
              benefits will result from combining the German group's expertise in
              thermoeconomics with the U.S. group's expertise in knowledge-based
              approaches.
