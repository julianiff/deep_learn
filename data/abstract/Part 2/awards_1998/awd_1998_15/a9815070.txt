Abstract    :
              The Association for Women in Mathematics will continue the program of
awarding
              travel support for women mathematicians to attend domestic or
foreign research
              conferences. The proposed level of funding will allow
approximately 75 grants,
              in amounts from $250 to $1,500, to be awarded
over a three year
              period.

Additional funds are requested to establish a pilot program of
              awards
to women mathematicians for travel, to work with
              particular
individuals in their research area for brief periods of time.
              The
proposed level of funding for these mentoring travel grants would
allow
              three to six grants per year of $4000 each over a period of 3
years.

Both
              programs are intended to enhance the research capability and the
visibility of
              women mathematicians, to expand the influence of their
work, and to increase
              their ability to inspire women at less advanced
levels to pursue (or continue)
              careers in mathematics, in the
sciences, or in other fields requiring
              substantial mathematical
training. Both programs seek (directly or indirectly)
              to make the
presence of women at places where research is being reported or
              done a
normal professional expectation, and to mitigate the
              persistant
problem of having too few women speakers at many
              mathematical
conferences. Both programs should be important tools for the
              retention
of women mathematicians in academic life. To assess the impact of
              this
program, and to see if there are ways the program could be improved,
              a
study will be taken of the effectiveness of past NSF grants to AWM
              for
travel grants.
