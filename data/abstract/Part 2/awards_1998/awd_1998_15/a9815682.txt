This project will
              initiate a study of the advection of large copepods onto continental shelves
              from the deep Arctic basin as a vital source of carbon for the planktonic
              ecosystem on the shelf.  Without this source of carbon, the planktonic biota
              would have little food supply and the benthic fauna would dominate the food
              web.  This fundamental process of transferring carbon from basin to upper
              waters of the shelf has not been studied in the Arctic ecosystem.  The process
              is very important due to the possible overwintering of the copepods in the deep
              basin where they can serve as an annual source of food for zooplankton and fish
              when advected to the shelf during the short Arctic summer.  The investigator
              will use retrospective analysis of data collected in the Chukchi and Beaufort
              Seas to develop a biological model of the advection of copepods to test
              hypotheses about the migration of plankton as well as the effects of ocean
              circulation on the process.  The model will allow testing of global change
              impacts on the availability of this important food source on the shelf.  The
              results of this project will provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field
              program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic
              area.
