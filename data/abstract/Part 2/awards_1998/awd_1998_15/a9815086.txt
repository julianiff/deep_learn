	The Hudson River Museum (HRM) will develop Hudson Riverama: 
              An Interactive, Long-term Exhibition for Families and School Children.  This
              will be a 2000 sq. ft. exhibit and will take the form of a trip along the
              Hudson River.  Part I, "The Journey,"  will introduce seven distinct river
              environments from Lake Tear in the Clouds to the New York Harbor.  Part II, 
              "River People,"  will present human occupations and activities that are related
              to the river such as a shad fisherman, a municipal planner, a sewage treatment
              worker, and an environmental educator.  The exhibit will present four
              fundamental, interrelated environmental concepts:  ecosystems, habitats,
              adaptation, and human impact on the environment.  Learners will immerse
              themselves in a habitat by "becoming" Hudson River animals and by role playing
              field guides, urban planners, etc.  National science standards will provide a
              framework for the exhibit and complementary educational activities.  The
              complementary materials will include pre- and post-visit materials for use by
              teachers and their students.  These will include visual, auditory, tactile and
              kinesthetic activities that will connect the science education requirements
              with the exhibit.  Information about the exhibit will be broadly disseminated
              and it is expected that other similar museums will emulate this approach.  The
              exhibit is scheduled to open in January, 2001.
