This project is carried out as a part of the NSF Research
              Centers - Small Firms Collaborative R&D initiative, under the leadership of the
              Cener for Virtual Proving Ground Simulation, an IUCRC established by the
              National Science Foundation.

Research in the IUCRC for Virtual Proving
              Ground Simulation has recently led to fundamentally new numerical methods that
              enable accurate and efficient simulation of broad classes of mechanical systems
              that were previously intractable using commercial software.  Stiff integrators
              for the differential-algebraic equations of mechanical system dynamics, based
              on implicit Runge-Kutta methods recently developed by the numerical analysis
              community, have been cre3ated in the Center that yield two orders of magnitude
              speed-up for stiff systems, compared to existing methods.  The algorithms
              created have reliable error control and have the potential to effectively deal
              with intermittent effects that abound in industrial applications.  The I/UCRC
              Industrial Advisory Board has instructed the Center to work with CADSI, a small
              business member of the Center, to transition this new technology into its DADS
              software product that is marketed nationally and internationally and is used
              extensively by Center members.  The present joint work by the I/UCRC and CADSI
              is to jointly develop effective new numerical methods; implement and test them
              in the Center's open computing environment, using selected advanced
              computational subroutines provided by CADSI; demonstrate them on applications
              defined by CADSI and other I/UCRC members; and transfer them to CADSI for
              commercialization.  The focus of the research and development is on the
              following important classes of industrial applications:

(1) Large-scale
              stiff mechanical systems (e.g., vehicles, aircraft, spacecraft)
(2)
              Intermittent effects (e.g., Coulomb friction, gears, and chains/track;
              contact/impact in mechanical systems; and switch-induced dynamics in power
              electronic drives and hydraulic drives)
