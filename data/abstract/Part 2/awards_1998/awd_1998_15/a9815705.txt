This
              research project will develop and test methods to measure constituents of the
              organic matter pool in the Arctic Ocean.  The goal of the proposed research is
              to gauge the degree to which biological activity contributes to the observed
              organic matter distributions.  The information is important for understanding
              the cycling of organic carbon in the Arctic Ocean, particularly the transport
              off continental shelves to the deep basin.  The results of this project will
              provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin
              Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic area.
