Abstract    :
              
When two or more characters are measured in members of a species, it is often
              found that they are correlated.  Taking data from a series of populations, it
              may be (for example) that two measurements both tend to be larger in the same
              populations.  Treating each population as an independent piece of evidence is,
              however, not correct.  Gene flow due to migration may have made neighboring
              populations have the same phenotypes, so that they cannot be treated as
              independent sources of evidence.  It is proposed to develop methods of
              correcting for this lack of independence.  Using an estimate of the migration
              rates among populations, it is possible to compute quantities (contrasts) that
              would vary independently.  These contrasts can then be treated as independent
              data points and used to make valid statistical statements about whether the
              characters are actually correlated.  These methods will be made available in
              the PHYLIP package of free phylogeny computer programs.  Other projects involve
              seeing whether correlations of characters can be inferred while simultaneously
              estimating the evolutionary tree, seeing whether models with developmental
              thresholds can allow us to use all-or-none traits, and seeing whether models of
              adaptive peaks can be used.
