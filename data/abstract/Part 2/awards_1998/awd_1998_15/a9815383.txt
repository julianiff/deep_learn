Spatial-temporal dynamics of plant-herbivore
              interactions and ecosystem processes in coastal tundra of the Yukon-Kuskokwim
              Delta in Western Alaska

This research will focus on how the spatial-temporal
              structure of feedbacks between vegetation and herbivore populations organizes
              ecosystem processes at local and regional scales. Understanding these feedbacks
              requires the coupling of both short-term and long-term impacts of herbivores on
              vegetation structure and nutrient cycling processes with the associated
              movement patterns and demographic parameters of herbivores. 
This project will
              build on a 14-year study of the demography of Black Brant geese, and on 7 years
              of research on vegetation/ecosystem response to herbivory. The investigators
              will mark 2,500 brant and record reproductive success for an additional 900
              previously-marked adults to enable estimation of age- and time-specific
              breeding probability and survival, and fidelity to specific brood-rearing
              areas. The investigators will also continue a long-term investigation of
              spatial variation in growth. The project is leveraged by work planned by the
              USGS on the Mexico wintering grounds of the brant, allowing the PIs to study
              the impact of wintering location on reproductive performance and survival. In
              addition, the data collected in this year will enable the PIs to test
              hypotheses related to El Nino effects from the 1997-98 ENSO event.
