This award supports the PI, Daniel Montello, co-PI Mary
              Hegarthy, and a graduate student from the University of California at Santa
              Barbara as well as co-PI Barbara Tversky and a graduate student from Stanford
              University in a collaboration with Christian Freksa of the Department of
              Informatics and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Hamburg, Germany.  The
              research focus is the description and explanation of mental processes and
              structures underlying behaviors such as navigation, spatial learning, and
              spatial language.  The field of study is interdisciplinary and will involve
              geographers, psychologists, computer scientists, and linguists.  The U.S. and
              German groups bring complementary capabilities to the enterprise.  The German
              side specializes in formal and computational modeling and the U.S. group, in
              empirical human-subjects methods and theory.  Each side's contribution will
              enhance the breadth of research of the other side, and will result in
              interactions between researchers in the several disciplines mentioned.
