This award will contribute funds to the
              US-Mexico Foundation for Science (USMXFS) in order to build up an endowment,
              income from which will be used to identify significant opportunities for
              cooperation in science and technology involving researchers from both countries
              in areas of common interest.  The US-Mexico Foundation for Science is a
              bilateral, non-governmental organization established in 1991 to bring about
              closer ties in science and technology between the United States and
              Mexico.

The USMXFS, with the support of advisory groups of experts from the
              scientific, government, and business communities of both countries, will
              organize workshops, conferences, studies, and exchanges of scientists and
              engineers in order to define the scope and content of binational science and
              technology projects and activities.  Those projects will compete for funds
              other than the endowment, derived from US and Mexican sources.  It is also the
              intent of the USMXFS to play a catalytic role in bringing together participants
              from different mission agencies and levels of government, scientific
              organizations, institutions of higher learning, and the private sector from
              both countries, to work together on shared problems, avoiding the duplication
              of cooperative activities already underway between the two countries or those
              that could be done by specialized institutions of each country.
