Abstract    :
              This award supports fundamental research and education in systems, which have
              topological quantum numbers.  The proposed work is focussed on the dynamics of
              vortices in superfluids and superconductors, mechanisms for flux flow at low
              temperature, the structure of surfaces and interfaces of fractional quantum
              Hall phases, and the nature of transitions between quantum Hall phases.  This
              award supports graduate education of students in condensed matter theory and
              theoretical research focussed on two important problems that lie at the
              frontiers of condensed matter theory that have a subtle geometric connection. 
              These are the motion of vortices in superconductors, and phase transitions
              between novel quantum states that occur in electrons trapped at semiconductor
              interfaces in high magnetic fields.
