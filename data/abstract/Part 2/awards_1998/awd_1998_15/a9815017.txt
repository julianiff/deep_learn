This project would develop a research portfolio of case
              study research designs with detailed plans and estimated costs.  The new
              international study that would be designed by this project would be an
              outgrowth of previous IEA studies of the use of computers in the classroom. 
              Two research questions will be addressed: How can we improve the effectiveness
              of technology in supporting education and educational change? And, what types
              of reflective dialogue among participants from different countries are
              necessary to enable the transfer and adaptation of technology-based educational
              innovations across barriers of culture and language?  The project will compile
              methodologies and findings from existing studies; solicit position papers on
              lessons learned; compile and analyze existing exemplary projects in the U.S.;
              draft model research designs; assemble a working group to review progress;
              convene a panel of scientists to project future science uses of technology; and
              prepare a statement of research priorities.

The project would identify model
              practices, review their outcomes, and build a base of knowledge about the
              implementation and sustainability of these model practices.  It would work with
              the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement
              (IEA).
