This award to University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of
              Oceanography will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on
              R/V Blue Fin, a research vessel operated as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet, or on other research vessels as
              required. Specific instrumentation to be acquired is a winch to support studies
              of marine biology and related instrumentation for deploying instrumentation on
              conducting cables. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Northwest Atlantic
              Ocean, in 1999 and future years.
