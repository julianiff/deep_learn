Abstract    :
              9815883  Cheek  Dr. Cheek will test the hypothesis that endocrine disruption
              reduces an animal's fertility (individual fitness).  This project is designed
              to answer the question, "if male fish make egg yolk or females make it on the
              wrong schedule, do fish fertility and populations size change as a result?" 
              Field and laboratory studies have shown that alterations in normal hormone
              levels and sex differentiation occur in animals in response to environmental
              contaminants but few studies have directly linked changes in endocrine function
              with changes in individual fitness.    This POWRE award will enable Dr. Cheek
              to conduct experiments that determine whether or not changes in yolk production
              or sexual development predict changes in fertility in fish.  It will also
              afford her the opportunity to have access to special facilities that are not
              available at Southeastern Louisiana University.
