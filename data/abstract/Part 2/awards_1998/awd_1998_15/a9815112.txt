Three components of this project include convening policy
              forums for education policy makers, augmenting TIMSS by the collection of many
              additional national-level variables, and completing a considerable number of
              secondary analysis of augmented TIMSS data.  The purpose of the analysis is to
              discover  why American 8th and 12th graders performed poorly in international
              comparisons on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.   The
              expanded research base provided by the results of this project should make a
              substantial contribution to achieving national goals.  The project will
              capitalize on the comprehensive data about mathematics and science education
              including student achievement scores, curriculum standards, curriculum content
              taught, instructional methods used, tracking and testing practices,
              qualifications and working conditions of teachers, student and family
              background factors, cultural context, and characteristics of the educational
              systems and policies.  The project will build statistical models of causal
              relationships.
