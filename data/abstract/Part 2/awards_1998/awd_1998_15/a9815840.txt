This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Quantum of Chemical Reaction Dynamics, to be held in
              Hawaii from 
December 13-16, l999.  The co-organizers are Professors Robert
              Gordon at the University of Illinois, Chicago and Yuichi Fujimura at Tokohu
              University in Sendai, Japan.  The field of quantum mechanical control of atomic
              and molecular motion is at the forefront of atomic, molecular, optical, and
              chemical physics.  The field may be broadly defined as the utilization of the
              quantum mechanical properties of matter to control the motion of electrons and
              nuclei.  Included within this definition are the control of chemical reactions,
              control of the motion of charge carriers in solids, alignment of molecules in
              gases, liquids, and thin films, and trapping and manipulation of the center of
              mass motion of atoms and molecules.  Major experimental breakthroughs have
              occurred during the past three years, however, the field is still in its
              infancy.

The seminar will focus on the current state of knowledge in the
              coherent control of electronic and nuclear motion in gases, liquids, solids,
              and their interfaces.  The major topics to be discussed are:  1) theory of
              coherent phase control;  2) experimental studies of coherent phase control;  3)
              theory of optimal control;  4) experiments in pulse shaping and wave packet
              control;  5) control of reaction dynamics in condensed phases; and 
6) control
              of photoinduced reactions on surfaces and interfaces.  This important area of
              research has many opportunities for major scientific breakthroughs.  Seminar
              organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both
              participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
              experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the
              seminar, a published volume of contributed papers will be made available for
              dissemination.
