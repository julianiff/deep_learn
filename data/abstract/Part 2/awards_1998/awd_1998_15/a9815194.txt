Raikh
This award supports Dr. Mikhail Raikh and two graduate students
              from the University of Utah in a collaboration with Michael Schreiber of the
              Department of Physics at the Technical University of Chemnitz-Zwickau in
              Chemnitz, Germany.  The research funded by this award will further our
              understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect by combining the expertise of
              the U.S. group in analytical techniques with that of the German group in
              numerical simulation.  Using a novel technique, called the renormalization
              group approach, the combined German and U.S. groups will be able to carry the
              understanding of the quantum Hall effect to a new level.  The two U.S. graduate
              students involved in the project will concentrate on the analytical aspects of
              the work, but, through their contact with the German group, will gain useful
              experience in computer simulation.  The German group has access to excellent
              super-computing facilities and is world renowned for numerical studies of the
              physics of disordered systems.
