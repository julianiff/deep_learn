This award supports Dr. Michael Wiescher, a research
              associate, and two graduate students from the University of Notre Dame in a
              collaboration with Franz Kaeppler of the Institute for Nuclear Physics at the
              Federal Research Center in Karlsruhe, Germany.  The research funded by this
              award will focus on the experimental study of alpha-induced reactions important
              for the understanding of nucleosynthesis in the various phases of stellar
              helium burning.  The proposed experiments will be done in collaboration with
              Dr. Kaeppler's Nuclear Astrophysics group, which is well known for its work in
              this area.  Most of the experiments will be performed at Karlruhe using
              specialized detector equipment available there, which will make it possible to
              detect low-energy resonances necessary for a complete understanding of the
              nucleosynthesis.  Complementary experiments will be performed at Notre Dame
              where alpha-scattering and alpha-proton reactions will be studied.
