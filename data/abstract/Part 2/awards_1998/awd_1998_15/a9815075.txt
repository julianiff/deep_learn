This award provides funds to support research at the
              University of Arizona, Arizona State University )ASU), Massachusetts Institute
              of Technology (MIT), and Cornell University on the topic of environmentally
              benign manufacturing of semiconductors.  The research is complementary to the
              activities of the Engineering Research Center (ERC) at the University of
              Arizona, with core partners at Stanford University, MIT, and the University of
              California at Berkeley, on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing of
              Semiconductors.  The scope of the research funded under this award includes dry
              resist deposition (MIT), supercritical fluid resist development (Cornell), and
              process integration (ASU).  The major emphasis of the research is to find
              alternate materials and processes that avoid or greatly reduce the use of
              potentially hazardous or environmentally detrimental chemicals.  The research
              is coordinated with the Engineering Research Center and reviewed annually at
              the annual site visit review of the ERC to assure the maximum leverage and
              relevance to the overall activities of the ERC.  Students are being educated in
              the important field of semiconductor manufacturing with strong emphasis on
              enviromental implications.
