Hachtel
This award supports Dr. Gary Hachtel and a graduate student
              from the University of Colorado-Boulder in a collaboration with Christopher
              Meinel of the Department of Information Sciences  at the University of Trier,
              Germany.  The research funded by this award will focus on the construction of
              very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits from very complex switching
              functions, and on verification of the systems constructed.  The collaboration
              between the U.S. and German groups will combine the best of current research in
              complexity theory and binary decision diagrams and will lead to the application
              of new and more powerful methods to design problems in micro-electronics,
              computers, and software engineering.  There is also a strong
              workforce-enhancement aspect to the award because the international research
              will extensively involve graduate students in the international
              collaboration.
