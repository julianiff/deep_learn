The c. 1350 AD activity of Mount Tarawera was the largest (5-10
              km3 magma volume) eruption in New Zealand, and one of the largest rhyolitic
              eruptions in the world, during the last millennium. The eruption products are
              locally known as the Kaharoa formation.  This event featured remarkable
              fluctuations in eruption style from highly explosive to effusive as a major
              pyroclastic fall deposit and several lava domes were emplaced. This
              collaborative study with New Zealand volcanologists will build on earlier
              mapping of Tarawera volcano to produce an integrated picture of the processes
              of a major rhyolite eruption.  Detailed field mapping of the relationships
              between the Kaharoa lava domes, block and ash pyroclastic flow deposits, and
              careful logging of the layers in the fall deposit will determine the details of
              the dispersal, clast characteristics, and grain size distribution.  Sampling of
              the eruption products for granulometric, grain morphologic, and crystal and
              vesicle size distribution studies will help determine the physical state of the
              magma upon eruption and eruption mechanisms.  Textural analysis of the rhyolite
              pyroclastics and dome lava samples, when combined with geochemical data to be
              obtained in the collaborative part of this study, will reveal information about
              the physical state (degree of undercooling, degassing, crystallization) of the
              magma during various phases of the eruption and the control that this exerted
              on the changing eruption styles.  Results of the study will be a general model
              for this type of volcanism worldwide, further understanding of the controls on
              variations in eruption style in lava dome-forming volcanism by magma degassing
              and effusion rate, and documentation of widely dispersed plinian deposits
              coincident with effusive rhyolitic activity.  The results will also be an
              integral part of a volcanic hazard assessment for future recurrences of this
              type of volcanism, both in New Zealand and worldwide.
