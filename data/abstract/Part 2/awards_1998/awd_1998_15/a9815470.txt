Abstract    :
              This award supports a human-computer interaction research consortium of
              promising doctoral students and distinguished research faculty, to be held in
              conjunction with the 1999 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI
              99), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest
              Group on Human Computer Interaction (ACM SIGCHI).  The goals of the Doctoral
              Consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then
              have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of
              new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice, and
              making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their
              research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of
              their work during the Consortium, and will receive feedback from the faculty
              panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate
              how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction work,
              whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects,
              whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their
              results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The student participants
              will also present their work during the technical program of the CHI 99
              conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via
              publication in the CHI 99 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and
              electronic dissemination.  Evaluation of the Consortium will be conduced by ACM
              SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be
              made available to the organizers of future consortia.
