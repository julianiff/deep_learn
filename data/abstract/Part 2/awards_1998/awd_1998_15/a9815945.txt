Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Herbert Strauss of the University of California will
              extend earlier studies on infrared vibrational hole burning and hole dynamics
              in condensed phases.  The time resolution of the experiments will be increased
              by one or more orders of magnitude, and the range of wavelength will also be
              increased.   New materials to be examined include alkanes, polymers, amino acid
              salts and polypeptide systems.  The results of these studies will help
              determine mechanisms of energy transfer, hole burning, and conformational
              transformation.  

A fundamental understanding of the structure and behavior
              of large molecules in condensed phases is potentially important for polymer
              engineering and biochemical applications.  The hole burning technique developed
              in this work can be used to give information about structural changes and
              energy flow that occur after molecules in condensed phases are excited.
