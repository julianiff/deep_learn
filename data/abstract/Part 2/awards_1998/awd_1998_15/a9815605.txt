Abstract    :
              ZERA
9815605

This is a cooperative project between Professor Anthony Zera,
              School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska Lincoln, and Dr. John
              Oakeshott, Entomology Program Leader in Biotechnology, Commonwealth Scientific
              Industrial Research Organization, Canberra, Australia.  Professor Zera will
              perform molecular-genetic experiments and sequence analysis under the direction
              of Dr. Oakeshott.  This experience will allow Prof. Zera to gain expertise in
              this area of biology.  The studies will also prepare the groundwork for a
              long-term collaborative project.
