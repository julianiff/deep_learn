This award supports Daniel Blake of the University of
              Illinois-Urbana-Champaign in a collaboration with Hans Hagdorn of the
              Muschelkalk Museum in Ingelfingen, Germany. The research will focus the study
              of the paleoecologic and taphonomic setting of the genus Trichasteropsis which
              dates back to the Triassic period (225 to 190 million years ago).  (The
              taphonomic setting of a fossil refers to the characteristics of the stratum of
              rock in which the fossil is found.)  The genus under study is pivotal in
              understanding the history of the Asteroids (starfish) and the evolution of
              post-Paleozoic marine ecosystems.  This is true because the Triassic asteroid
              forms a bridge between the Paleozoic and Jurassic asteroids.  The research will
              delineate the morphology, range of variation, ontogenetic development, and
              phylogenetic position of the genus as well as its paleoecological setting.  The
              collaboration combines the PI's experience with asteroid taxonomy with
              Hagdorn's experience with the geological setting of the genus.
