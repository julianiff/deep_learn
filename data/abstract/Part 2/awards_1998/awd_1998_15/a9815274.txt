This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in environmental chemistry involves Brian Teppen, Paul M. Bertsch at
              the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and Armand Masion
              at the Universite d'Aix Marseille III.  The objective of their research is the
              study of iron-silicate complexation mechanisms that are thought to result in
              ironstone formation in soils.  They will study aqueous iron-silicate complex
              formation at the atomic scale and the semi-local scale and combine the results
              obtained from X-ray absorption and scattering experiments with dynamic
              molecular modeling.  The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise
              in molecular dynamics methods.  This is complemented by French expertise in
              iron hydrolysis and by access to complementary synchrotron radiation
              instrumentation and facilities.  The experiments will take place at the
              National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven, New York and at LURE
              (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnetique) at the
              University of Paris. 

Ironstone formation occurs in tropical soils over time
              as heat and moisture deplete soils of organic matter and inorganic plant
              nutrients.  The soils become enriched in aluminum and iron, the iron is
              redistributed, and as a result of erosion, ironstones form and are exposed at
              the soil surface, thereby limiting plant growth.  This project will advance
              understanding of this process and how to optimally manage the chemistry of
              tropical soils .
