This project
              will utilize existing samples in the Beaufort Sea to determine if the organic
              matter in the Arctic Ocean can be "fingerprinted" to reveal its source.  If so,
              the distribution patterns may be estimated and the availability of the organic
              matter for support of primary production may be assessed.  The project is very
              important to understanding the way carbon is transported between the
              continental shelf and deep basin and into the sediment.  The results will also
              be important for analysis of organic matter in the sediment as a clue to the
              history of biogenic production in the basin.  The sedimentary record could
              reveal changes that have occurred in response to climate change. The results of
              this project will provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of
              the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic area.
