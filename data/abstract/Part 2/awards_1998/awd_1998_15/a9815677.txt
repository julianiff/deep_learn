This project is carried out as a part of the NSF Research
              Centers - Small Firms Collaborative R&D initiative, under the leadership of the
              Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering (CAPCE), an IUCRC
              established by the National Science Foundation.

In this project, faculty and
              students in the Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering (CAPCE)
              will work closely with a group of small firms to develop techniques of using
              supercritical carbon dioxide to (1) reduce residual monomer and volatile
              organic compounds (VOC) in reactive  extrusion and continuous polymerization
              processes, and (2) control cell size and cell distribution in continuous
              micro-cellular foaming.  These R&D efforts are new ideas originating from the
              participating small firms:  METSS Corporation, Plaskolite, and MPM Extrusion
              Division.  The small firms involved include an extruder vendor (HPM Extrusion
              Division), a sheet extrusion company (Plaskolite), and a materials research
              firm (METSS).  CAPCE will use $100,000 ($50,000/yr for two years) industry
              funds to match the NSF funding.  Edison Polymer Innovation Corporation (EPIC)
              will also provide $100,000 of state funds to CAPCE in 1999.  A portion of this
              funding will be used to support this proposal.
