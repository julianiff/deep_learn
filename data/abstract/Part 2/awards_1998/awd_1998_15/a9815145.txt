Abstract    :
                    9815145  Hofmann    This project will allow a secondary school teacher to 
              participate in the antarctic field program of  The National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration Climate  Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory
              (NOAA/CMDL) during  the 1998-99 austral summer season under the NSF Teacher 
              Experiencing Antarctica program.    The specific work will involve a study of
              the  characteristics of the electrochemical cell ozonesonde, a 
              balloon-launched instrument to measure the vertical  distribution of
              atmospheric ozone, and an analysis of the  records of the expected depletion of
              stratospheric ozone in  the austral Spring 1998.    The Teacher Experiencing
              Antarctica (TEA) program is  intended to give competitively selected teachers
              experience  in an antarctic research program as a component of their  continued
              professional development, and is based on  matching the interests of the
              selected teacher and the  research objectives of an ongoing antarctic
              scientific  project.  The ultimate objective of the TEA program is to 
              establish a growing collaborative learning community of  teachers, students,
              school districts, and the community.  ***
