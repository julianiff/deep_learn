This award supports Gar Hoflund and two graduate students from
              the University of Florida in a collaboration with the laboratory of Horst Hahn
              of the Materials Science Department at the University of Darmstadt, Germany. 
              The goal of the research is to develop novel methane oxidation catalysts for
              use in catalytic converters in automobiles that run on natural gas.  The
              catalysts will consist of noble metals such as silver, palladium, gold, and
              platinum.  A novel aspect of the work will be the use of nanocrystalline oxide
              supports.  Natural gas as a fuel is less costly per unit of energy than
              gasoline, and, if properly burned, less damaging to the environment.  The
              catalysts studied in this work are designed for long life and high
              efficiency.
