This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in ocean sciences involves Don Boyer, David Smith, Nicholas Perenne at
              Arizona State University and Dominique Renouard of the Laboratoire des
              Ecoulements Geophysiques et Industriels in Grenoble, France.  They will conduct
              a series of laboratory experiments and associated numerical models of the
              oscillatory flow of homogenous incompressible fluid in the 
vicinity of canyon
              arrays in the deep ocean.  The goals of the project are to improve
              understanding of the nature of coastal current systems and to provide
              laboratory data sets that can be used as benchmarks for the validation of
              numerical models.  In particular improved models could be used to predict the
              transport of nutrients and pollutants along the coast and into or out of ocean
              canyon arrays. 

The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise
              in numerical modeling.  This is complemented by French expertise in the design
              of the laboratory experiments.  It also takes advantage of a 13 m diameter, 1 m
              deep rotating tank facility, a larger tank than is
currently available at
              Arizona State University.  The tank will be used to simulate the ocean
              environment, in particular, the continental slope region.
