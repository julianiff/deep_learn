This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              materials science and biological physics involves Philip Nelson of the
              University of Pennsylvania and Jacques Prost and Frank Julicher of the Institut
              Curie.  Their research is focused on theoretical studies of the dynamics of
              biological systems consisting of lipid bilayer membranes, molecular motors and
              cytoskeletal filaments.  Recent biological experiments have demonstrated that
              the interaction of these three physical components plays a key role in the
              formation of cell organelles that have the structure of membrane networks. 
              This theoretical work will investigate the interaction of all three
              components.

The US team brings to this collaboration expertise in the
              dynamics of lipid bilayer membranes and of networks.  This is complemented by
              French expertise on membranes and molecular motors.  Researchers at the
              Institut Curie will also carry out controlled in vitro experiments, permitting
              further refinement of the theoretical models.
