Abstract    :
              The major goals of this grant are to 1) systemically evaluate the Meyerhoff
              Program's positive, long-term academic outcomes (e.g., persistence to
              graduation in SMET majors, enrollment in SMET graduate programs, and completion
              of SMET graduate degrees); 2) improve the scientific rigor of the comparison
              samples (through random assignment) against which the success of the Meyerhoff
              Scolars is measured so that the positive outcomes may be more definitively
              attributed to the program; 3) further delineate the program characteristics
              perceived by students as most responsible for their success; and 4) further
              explore the processes underlying African-American student success in SMET
              majors.  Additionally, this research will ascertain whether the same processes
              are responsible for African-American graduate, as for undergraduate, SMET
              student successes, a virtually unexplored topic.
