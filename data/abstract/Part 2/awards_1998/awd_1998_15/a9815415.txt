This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in condensed matter physics involves Paul C. W. Chu and Qidu Jiang at
              the University of Houston's Texas Center for Superconductivity and Alain
              Gilabert at the Universite de Nice Laboratoire de Physique de la Matiere
              Condense.  Their research is in an active area of high temperature
              superconductivity.  The goal of their collaboration is to correlate the
              photodoping properties of bicrystal boundary Josephson junctions with nanometer
              structures at the bicrystal grain boundary which has been obtained by scanning
              tunneling and atomic force microscopic techniques.  Sample fabrication and
              non-destructive characterization of the bicrystal boundary will be carried out
              at the University of Houston.  This will be complemented by French studies of
              their normal state and superconducting properties upon light illumination.
              

This study of the photodoping effects on the bicrystal boundary junctions
              will advance fundamental understanding of photodoping mechanisms and the nature
              of the weak link of high temperature Josephson junction.
