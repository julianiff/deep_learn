The meteorologists at SUNY Oswego have engaged in
              funded research involving  numerical simulation of winter storms while
              attempting to train approximately 70 meteorology majors in weather analysis
              Unidata software with a 5-year-old  Hewlett-Packard workstation and several
              PC's.  The rapid increase in the usage by  our students of Unidata  products
              such as GARP has exceeeded the capability of this workstation for instructional
              use.  Moreover, the access to the machine for faculty and student research has
              decreased significantly in the last two years.  Oswego is requesting a Linux 
              workstation and four new terminals to meet its needs.
