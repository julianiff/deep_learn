Title: Causes of
              Precipitation Variability over Tropical Continents

The study proposes to
              examine variability of summer precipitation over South America and Africa, on
              time scales including from the event to the interannual. Satellite-derived and
              ground-based observations will 
be examined. Modeling tools used to identify
              and understand various physical mechanisms  influencing tropical precipitation 
              will be a linear model, a dry non-linear model, idealized and realistic general
              
circulation models and a meso-scale model. NCEP and ECMWF reanalyzes as well
              as CSM model output will also be analyzed. The work is important because it
              will enhance understanding  regarding climate 
variability over Africa and
              South America and this could have important societal impacts.
