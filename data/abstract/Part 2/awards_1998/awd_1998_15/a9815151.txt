Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the work of Dr. William J. Evans, Chemistry
              Department, University of California at Irvine to explore the reductive
              chemistry of lanthanide elements from a recent discovery in Dr. Evans
              laboratory of the reductive power of samarium(II) systems. The work proposed
              includes the preparation of, and an exploration of the reactivity of other
              organolanthanide compounds.

This work is wide ranging in the field of
              organolanthanide chemistry. New compounds will be synthesized and their
              chemical reactivity as reducing agents will be probed. Success will mean the
              opening up of a huge new area of chemistry for exploration with opportunities
              in catalytic chemistry as the lanthanides have the advantage of low toxicity.
              Students and post-doctoral associates will receive excellent training in
              handling these rare-earth systems.
