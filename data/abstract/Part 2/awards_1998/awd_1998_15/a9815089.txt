Abstract    :
              It is well known that the solar wind is strongly coupled to the Earth's
              magnetosphere.  What is often not appreciated is that this coupling is
              accomplished through the intermediary of the magnetosheath, which is generated
              by the shock that separates the supersonic solar wind from the Earth.  The
              proposed research program will examine IMP-8 data from the past 20 years to
              produce a data set of magnetosheath plasma density, velocity and temperature
              which will then be correlated with the solar wind conditions.  Maps will be
              generated to delineate the boundary of the plasma mantle for different solar
              wind conditions and finally comparisons will be made between the observations
              and MHD models.
