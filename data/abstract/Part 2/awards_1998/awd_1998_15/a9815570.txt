This three-year award will support US-France collaborative
              research in earth science between Teng-fong Wong of the State University of New
              York at Stony Brook and Yves Gueguen of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris,
              France.  The objective of the research is to study the mechanical, chemical
              stress and the impact of the transport of fluid on physical properties of
              rocks.  Fluid transport, linked to many processes in the earth's crust, exerts
              significant mechanical and chemical effects on processes of interest in
              seismotectonics, petroleum geology, aqueous geochemistry, and geotechnical
              engineering.  The key physical parameter that governs fluid transport is
              permeability.  The investigators will measure rock deformation and electric
              transport properties over a wide range of pressure conditions comparable to
              crustal pressure.  Through new experiments, they will investigate the effects
              of permeability, pressure and cementation on mechanical behavior of
              unconsolidated and cemented granular materials.  In parallel, theoretical
              models will be developed to interpret the physical properties of rocks.
 
The
              US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in experimentation and
              measurements related to physical properties of rocks.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in theory and in experimental techniques geared for electrical
              measurements.  The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the
              constraints on crustal processes.
