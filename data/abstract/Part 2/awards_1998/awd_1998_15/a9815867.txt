The treehopper subfamily
              Centrotinae is an assemblage of 1420 plant-feeding insects, currently placed
              among 187 genera and 19 tribes.  Despite their taxonomic richness, cosmopolitan
              distribuiton, and occasional importance as plant pests, centrotine taxonomy is
              in serious disarray.  Separate classifications have been developed for the Old
              and New World taxa, and 26 genera are unplaced at the tribal level.  The
              objectives of this project are to establish the limits of the subfamily,
              determine evolutionary relationships among the tribes to provide a
              comprehensive, phylogenetic classification, resolve the biogeographic origins
              of key life history traits such as aggregation behavior and ant-mutualism, and
              develop taxonomic tools for identifying the tribes.
