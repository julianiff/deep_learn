Abstract    :
              
Previous research generated the beginning of a theoretical framework for
              analyzing how algorithm animations and visualizations of abstract dynamic
              phenomena can  provide effective learning experiences to students.  The central
              goals of this proposed project are to develop the theoretical foundation of
              visualization design and analysis for effective instruction further. The PI
              will conduct a series of empirical studies to test research questions from the
              pilot project.  Redesign an existing Java-based algorithm animation authoring
              tool into an animation embedded hypermedia information presentation system; and
              implement this system as a network-enabled distributed visualization
              construction and delivery tool with a client-server architecture and deploy the
              tool in an undergraduate course on data structures and algorithms.

Empirical
              studies will test hypotheses derived from the theoretical analysis of the
              language and assess the educational efficacy of the artifact implementing this
              language in laboratory and classroom settings.  This project will have
              scientific, educational, and training aspects.
