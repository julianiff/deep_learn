"Midwestern Wild Weather" is a traveling exhibition designed to
              reach the target audiences in the small/rural communities and the science
              centers and museums in the states of  Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan. 
              This is a three-year project to replicate five of a set of nine interactive
              exhibits on the topic of Wild Weather.  This exhibition is being produced in
              collaboration with SPARC (Springfield, Peoria, Aurora, Rockford and Carbondale)
              which are cities located in the State of Illinois.  The project represents a
              strong model for collaboration between museums, science centers and the formal
              educational system.

An innovative feature of this project design is the use
              of "attractor" exhibits to entice persons to come to the museum and/or science
              center.  "Many places have talked about doing this but few have tried it." 
              Also, this project has the potential to fill the real need of making available
              quality exhibits to small museums and bringing informal education resources to
              small/rural communities.

The Science and Technology Interactive Center's
              cost share for this project is 52.1 percent of the total budget.
