Sussman
This award supports Michael Sussman and a graduate student
              from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Guenther
              Scherer of Institute for Plant Development at the University of Hannover,
              Germany.  The research funded by this award will increase our understanding of
              plant signal transduction through analysis of a mechanism that has been under
              study in both the U.S. and German labs.  Present knowledge of the mechanisms
              involved is unable to resolve certain complexities of the chain of chemical
              reactions involved in the plant process being looked at.  The collaboration
              makes use of specific expertise to be found only in the two labs, and will
              involve the exchange of graduate students as well as senior researchers.
