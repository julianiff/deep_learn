The investigators will analyze current velocity data from buoys
              that have drifted in the Arctic ice pack in the Beaufort Sea since 1993. The
              current velocity data provide an observational basis to study annual
              circulation features in the Arctic Ocean that cannot be observed by any other
              means.  The data will be used to examine eddies in the upper water column for
              evidence of transport of water and nutrients off the shelf to the basin. 
              Particular interest will be paid to the eddies as the buoy drifts over the
              continental shelf into the deep basin. The shelf break has been shown to be a
              particularly important area for transport of carbon from the productive shelf
              area to the basin where it is lost to the shelf ecosystem. The results of this
              project will provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of the
              Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002 in the same geographic area.
