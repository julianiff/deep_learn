Abstract    :
              Roberts  IBN 9815479    Steroid hormones are integral modulators of neural 
              communication and development.  These simple molecules,  acting as hormones,
              have the potential to influence all  neural functions from initiation of neural
              development to  the activity of individual synapses in adults.  Recent 
              advances in knowledge about non-genomic actions of steroid  hormones, the
              interactions with glial cells, and the role of  steroid hormones on neural
              organization, have had striking  effects on neuroendocrine physiology, neuronal
              cell biology,  reproductive physiology and non-reproductive behaviors such  as
              learning and memory, aging, aggression, social context,  feeding, and emotion. 
              This action will provide support for  a Young Investigator Symposium to be held
              at the 1997, 1998,  1998, and 1999 Workshop on Steroid Hormone and Brain 
              Function.  This workshop brings together scientists of  varied scientific
              background and perspectives in order to  integrate aspects of molecular
              biology, anatomy, physiology,  and behavior within a single session focused on
              an important  and timely issue concerning steroid hormones and brain  function.
               Topics have ranged from extranuclear steroid  hormone receptors to a
              comparative approach to sexual  differentiation to steroid modulation of
              neuronal survival.  Each year, new symposia are presented on interdisciplinary 
              topic in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The inclusion of the
              Young Investigator Symposium provides a  mechanism to ensure the strong
              participation of beginning  scientist, to recognize their achievements and
              potential,  and to facilitate collaborative efforts that may  significantly
              enhance our understanding of fundamental  neurobiological mechanisms.
