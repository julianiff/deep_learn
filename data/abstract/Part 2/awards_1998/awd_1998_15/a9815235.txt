The Placodontia were a group of reptiles that invaded the
              oceans of the Mesozoic around 250 million years ago.  Placodonts were
              restricted to the western Tethyan faunal province.  Their fossils are found
              today in Central Europe and circum-mediterranean countries.  The first
              appearance of placodonts is correlated with a Lower Triassic sea-level rise
              that created the habitats where the group eventually diversified.  The group
              went extinct in the aftermath of a Late Triassic drop in sea level. Although
              two separate groups of placodonts have previously been recognized, the
              "unarmored" (Placodontoidea) and the "armored" (Cyamdontoidea) placodonts, the
              relationships within the groups remain poorly understood.  An improved
              understanding of the history of placodonts may have important consequences for
              understanding higher level relationships among reptiles as a whole.  It will
              also provide the necessary background for improved insight on the functional
              anatomy of the feeding system among members of the group.  Understanding the
              historical biogeographic relationships among placodonts will in turn improve
              understanding of the complex geological history of the region they inhabited.
