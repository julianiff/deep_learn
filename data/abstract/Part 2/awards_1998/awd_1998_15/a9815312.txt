Abstract    :
                  The International Congress of Neuroethology has met at three-year intervals
              since 1986, to bring together researchers working on the neural basis of
              behavior in vertebrate and invertebrate animals.  The huge range of behaviors
              shown by many sorts of animals is a challenge to explain, and this diversity
              also can be used to illuminate basic principles of the organization and design
              of brains in general.  It is productive, for example, to study a specialist in
              a particular kind of behavior such as bat echolocation, or a relatively simple
              system such as leech swimming, because detailed comparisons of the networks of
              nerve cells in brains often reveal unexpected mechanisms that need to be
              incorporated in our thinking about the complexity of brain function.   The
              conference format is designed to emphasize talks on behavioral specializations,
              and on comparing common neural mechanisms across animals, with other talks on
              technical advances such as optical imaging and computational techniques for
              studying brain function.  This award will provide partial support for student
              travel to the meeting.
   This meeting will have an impact across
              neuroscience, from cellular approaches to behavior, and will also foster the
              careers of young investigators, and so have an impact on the infrastructure of
              neuroscience.
