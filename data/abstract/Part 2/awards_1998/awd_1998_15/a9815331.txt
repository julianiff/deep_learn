Abstract    :
                The focus of the research is the relation between Native rights and children's
              rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
              recently that there is limited territorial jurisdiction in Alaska. Native
              Alaskans are expressing autonomy within this legal opportunity now available. 
              The Department of Justice has begun working with tribal political structures to
              work out tribal legal authority. One focal area of debate has been child
              welfare.  In addition, the State of Alaska has now ceded concurrent authority
              and jurisdiction over child welfare to tribal governing bodies when the
              children are Native.  These federal and state decisions have just taken effect
              so their practical consequences are being realized immediately. The early child
              welfare cases will most clearly demonstrate which of several possible foci will
              form the core of future research. The investigators are working with the
              Tlingit Indians, a Southeast Alaska Native community. The Tlingit have been
              leaders in self-determination and their social system contrasts with the
              dominant Western legal tradition in many important ways. The community is
              currently involved in a dynamic conversation regarding the roles and
              responsibilities of local tribal governments in relation to state and federal
              mandates.  The researchers will attempt to answer several questions including: 
              what mechanisms for resolving child welfare problems are under consideration
              and why? What effects will community choices have on child welfare? What
              problems do they face in balancing local needs with those of the state?  The
              investigators will gather critical information via legally informed,
              ethnographic research.  The research will allow the PIs to explore definitively
              the problems in accessing data in the native community. This research is
              important in understanding the relation between law and society in general and
              the conflict between indigenous and state legal systems in particular.
