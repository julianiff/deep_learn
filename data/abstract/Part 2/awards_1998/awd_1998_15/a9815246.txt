This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              stellar astronomy involves Moshe Elitzur of the University of Kentucky and
              Thierry Montmerle of the Centre d'Etude de Saclay.  The project addresses star
              formation (how and why do stars form?) by modeling the spectral energy
              distributions of young stars.  The researchers will perform detailed analysis
              of radiation observed from IR to mm-wavelengths in star forming regions.  The
              US group brings to this collaboration theoretical expertise and experience in
              studying emissions of heavy mass objects.  This is complemented by French
              expertise in detailed studies of emissions from low-mass pre-main-sequence
              objects.  Together they will develop a two dimensional code for interpretation
              of observational data provided by the French astronomers.
