Abstract    :
              Despite a remarkable increase over the past decade in the use of stakeholder
              groups as part of efforts to manage environmental and health risks, little
              attention has been given to research that will improve group decision
              processes.  This award addresses this gap through two interrelated research
              efforts.  First, investigators will examine the theory of group decision
              processes, in order to assist stakeholders participating in risk or
              environmental management controversies to provide useful input to the design of
              actions and policies.  Second, they will test the effectiveness of these
              recommendations by establishing criteria for measurement of a `better` decision
              and designing experiments to test and compare various approaches to group
              decisionmaking.  The questions to be addressed by these two facets of the
              research are both fundamental and challenging: What is citizen involvement in
              risk management intended to achieve?  How can we measure its success?  How much
              involvement is enough?  How does a policy maker know that stakeholder
              perspectives have been incorporated faithfully?  How can the insights of
              stakeholders best be presented to decision makers?  Among the benefits of this
              research will be the design of better techniques for helping health and
              environmental risk managers to incorporate stakeholder objectives, as well as a
              better dialogue across practitioners and policy makers regarding the steps to
              be used in facilitating and assessing public involvement processes.
