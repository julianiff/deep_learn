As the Southern Ocean cooled during the past 25 million years,
              the fishes of Antarctic coastal waters evolved biochemical and physiological
              adaptations that maintain essential cellular processes such as cytoskeletal
              function and gene transcription. Their microtubules, for example, assemble and
              function at body temperatures (-1.8 to +1 degree centigrade) well below those
              of temperate species. The long-range goals of this research project are to
              determine, at the molecular level, the adaptations that enhance the assembly of
              microtubules, the expression of tubulin and globin genes, and the activity of
              microtubule motors in this extreme thermal regime. The specific objects are
              three in number: 1) to determine the primary sequence changes that contribute
              to the efficient polymerization of Antarctic fish tubulins at low temperatures;
              2) to characterize the structure, organization and promoter-driven expression
              of tubulin and globin genes from an Antarctic rockcod and a temperate congener;
              and 3) to examine the biochemical adaptation required for efficient function of
              the brain kinesin motor of Antarctic fishes at low temperatures. Together,
              these studies should reveal the molecular adaptation of Antarctic fishes that
              maintain efficient cytoskeletal assembly, mechanochemical motor function, and
              gene expression at low temperatures.
