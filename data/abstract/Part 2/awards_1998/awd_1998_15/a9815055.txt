Abstract    :
                 Mast cells are a class of cells found in the brain that are not  themselves
              nerve cells, or neurons.  Although often associated  with allergies, they are
              present in normal brains.  Their numbers  can change in adults as a result of
              hormonal changes, and there is  molecular evidence that mast cell secretions
              can affect long-term  modifications of excitability of nerve cells.  A novel
              recent  hypothesis, based on some preliminary data from birds, is that  mast
              cells may be small migratory glandular units, capable  releasing compounds with
              neurotransmitter or modulator activity.  Release of compounds from mast cells
              appears to be different from  release of neurotransmitter from nerve cells; in
              mast cells  granules appear to form within the cell and may fuse to form large 
              secretion chambers, or sometimes much smaller releases are seen.  This Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports studies  to develop electron
              microscopical techniques to substantiate how  this novel release mechanism
              occurs, to compare observations on  mammals with prior observations on birds,
              and to add histochemical  techniques to determine what compounds may be passed
              from mast  cells to neurons.      Results will have a substantial impact beyond
               neuroendocrinology because mast cells occur in all vertebrate  brains, and
              these mechanisms could be very important for  understanding the plasticity of
              neuronal function in the brain.  A  novel form of cellular secretion also will
              be important to general  cell biology.
