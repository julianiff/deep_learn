Abstract    :

The organic carbon generated biologically and distributed in the
              world ocean is intimately related to the functioning of the entire global
              carbon cycle as well to the ecology of the seas.  The investigators on this
              project, who are established leaders in the study of the marine carbon cycle,
              will continue their research into the cycling of organic carbon in both its
              dissolved and particulate forms.  The overall objective is to use the natural
              and anthropogenic radiocarbon (14C) in dissolved and particulate organic matter
              to estimate turnover times and reservoir sizes in the ocean.  They will examine
              changes in the carbon reservoirs and turnover since the last measurements were
              made one decade ago in the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins.  They will
              also attempt to constrain the residence time of upper ocean refractory
              dissolved organic carbon by surveying the 14C composition of dissolved and
              particulate organic matter in specific organic classes such as protein,
              carbohydrate, and lipids.  Finally, they propose to measure 14C in bacterial
              nucleic acids to investigate bacterial utilization of old dissolved organic
              matter.  The investigators anticipate that this work would lead to major new
              insights into the biogeochemical role played by these non-living forms of
              carbon in the world ocean.
