The objective of the workshop
              is to identify the R&D needs for enabling and supporting the next generation
              Wireless Technologies and Information Networks.  The workshop will address
              fundamental research issues and the technological challenges that must be
              resolved to enable the wireless technologies and facilitate their full and
              optimized utilization in a wide variety of applications central to the
              society's effective performance in the next millennium.  The focus in the
              workshop will be on the physical devices used in wireless networks and on the
              networking/communications algorithms and the signal processing techniques
              employed by those devices.
