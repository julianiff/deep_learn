This U.S.-Slovene research project between Gregory
              Crawford of Brown University and Slobodan Zumer of the University of Ljubljana
              examines homeotropically-aligned liquid crystals in micropores and thin films. 
              Daniele Finotello of Kent State University will also contribute.  Their
              objectives are to 1) explore the fundamental physical chemical properties
              behind self assembled layers on surfaces for liquid crystal alignment and 2)
              establish ways in which the aligning layers can be modified and manipulated to
              influence the liquid crystal alignment directions.

The researchers intend to
              investigate the surface induced ordering for configurations with homeotropic
              boundary conditions by using magnetic resonance techniques to probe alignment
              layers and the liquid crystal.  This will permit direct investigation of the
              ordering of the alignment layer in both nematic and isotropic phase.  Their
              approach will be to selectively deuterate molecules useful in alignment layers
              and attach them to the walls of porous membranes possessing the appropriate
              surface-to-volume ratio for magnetic resonance experiments.  Additional
              microcalorimetry and optical techniques will be employed.  Results should
              improve our fundamental understanding of ordering in these systems and may be
              applicable in novel flat liquid crystal display devices.

This project in
              solid state chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
