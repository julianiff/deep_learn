ABSTRACT:  Alice is a traveling exhibition based on Lewis
              Carroll's beloved classic Alice in Wonderland.  Alice will open in early 2001,
              first in San Jose and subsequently at mid-size children's museums and science
              centers across the country.  It is projected that over the four years of
              traveling this exhibition around the United States, a target audience of more
              than two million people will view the project.  The target audience for the
              exhibition is young children age 3-8 years old, with an emphasis on attracting
              girls and minorities, populations traditionally underserved in science and
              mathematics, together with their parents and teachers.  

Alice takes the
              link between curiosity and explanation as its rationale, using its eponymous
              heroine's dream-adventure as a framework for activities that will help children
              and adults build a shared foundation for mathematics and science
              literacy.

The designer for the project will be Koem Liem, a recognized
              exhibit developer.
