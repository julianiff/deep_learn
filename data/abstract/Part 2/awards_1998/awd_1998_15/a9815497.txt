Abstract    :
              
This project will utilize existing data sets on the biomass, density, and
              composition of benthic organisms in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as an
              indicator of the patterns of sinking organic matter that provides the energy to
              sustain the benthic community.  In addition to the biologic data sets, physical
              properties of the water column, sediments, and sea ice will be used as
              environmental variables controlling distribution patterns.  Geographic
              Information System (GIS) software will be used to examine and graphically
              display relationships between predominant physical forcing processes and
              ecosystem productivity.  The resulting data set will allow examination of the
              effects of changing climate conditions on the distribution of biologic
              productivity patterns in the Arctic Ocean.  The results of this project will
              provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin
              Interactions project in 2002.
