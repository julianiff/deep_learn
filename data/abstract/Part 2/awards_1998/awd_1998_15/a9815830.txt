This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              computational linguistics involves Nancy Ide of Vassar College and Laurent
              Romary, Director of the CNRS Laboratoire LORIA in Nancy.   The project is aimed
              at the development of models and methods for the study of the relationship
              between discourse structure of text and dialogue reference.  The investigation
              will be extended to a multilingual context and to more complex linguistic
              annotation.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise on
              linguistic annotation and exploitation.  This is complemented by the French
              group's research on automated reference resolution in the context of
              man-machine dialogue.  The project takes advantage of opportunities to test the
              models and methods in at least two different languages.
