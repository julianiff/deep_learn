This research project is an investigation of the
              characteristics that permit organisms to survive in environments that vary
              though time.  This issue will be explored for two populations of freshwater
              crustaceans (copepods) that experience year-to-year changes in the depths of
              the lakes in which they live.  Previous studies have shown that the copepods
              are of two kinds:  those with a long-term dormancy that makes it possible for
              them to survive harsh periods; and those possessing a low-risk life history
              while they are active in the water column.  This project asks under what
              conditions these two "strategies" should be expected to coexist, and whether
              the organisms possessing them differ genetically.  The work involves
              collections of active animals and dormant eggs from lakes, combined with
              laboratory breeding experiments.  The data will then be compared with
              theoretical predictions to gain a fuller understanding of organism survival in
              changing environments.

One projected effect of global environmental change
              is an increase in climate variation among years.  This temporal variation is a
              special challenge for organisms because characters that work well under one set
              of conditions may not work under another.   According to theory, organisms may
              be expected to evolve compromise, or "bet-hedging" life histories that permit
              them to survive under such conditions.  This project asks if the
              characteristics organisms possess are in fact those predicted by theory.  The
              answer will help in understanding the long-term and short-term responses of
              organisms to changing environments.
