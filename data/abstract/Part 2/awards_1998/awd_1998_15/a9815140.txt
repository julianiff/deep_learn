This project involves the installation of an instrument to
              measure carbonaceous aerosol in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and the generation of
              a data base that will be used to assess the impact of the operations of the
              U.S. Antarctic Program on the antarctic environment.

The McMurdo Dry
              Valleys, the location of a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study site,
              supports a fragile, nutrient-limited ecosystem  that may be significantly
              affected by human activities.  One aspect is the generation and deposition of
              carbonaceous aerosols  particles ("black carbon") from the exhaust of diesel
              power generators and helicopter operations within the Dry Valleys, and the
              possible long-distance transport of combustion products from McMurdo station,
              approximately 100 km distant.  A real-time optical analyzer will be deployed at
              the LTER site for three austral summer seasons to measure the concentration of 
              black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other filterable organic
              useful in fingerprinting combustion products.
