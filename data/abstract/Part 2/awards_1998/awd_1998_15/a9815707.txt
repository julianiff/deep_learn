The
              investigator will examine the presence of barium in the water and sediment in
              the Beaufort Sea as a tracer for river sources of particles that are carried
              off the continental shelf by oceanographic currents. The barium tracer has been
              shown to be an effective tracer for determining exchange processes between
              coastal and basin regions and, as such, will be an excellent way to examine the
              pathways and exchange rate of carbon from the productive continental shelf to
              the deep basin.  The investigator will examine water samples and sediment-trap
              sediments for barium and use the measurements in a model to reveal offshore
              circulation patterns in the Arctic Ocean.  Continued development of a new
              instrument for a barium analyzer that can be used to measure barium from a
              ship. The project forms an important component of the Shelf-Basin Interaction
              project which is designed to examine the processes that control the transport
              of  carbon from the biologically productive Arctic Ocean continental shelf to
              the deep basin.  The results of this project will provide input for planning a
              large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002 in
              the same geographic area.
