This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              theoretical physics involves Burt Ovrut of the University of Pennsylvania,
              Richard Grimm of the Centre de Physique Theorique in Marseille, and Ignatius
              Antoniadis of the Centre de Physique Theorique of the Ecole Polytechnique in
              Paliseau, France.  The collaboration is aimed at a more systematic
              understanding of the point particle limit, or low energy limit of string theory
              and of the patterns of dualities relating different string theories.   The
              investigators will study dualities and compactification of schemes with
              particular emphasis on the role of non-zero modes and on possible effective
              theories of supersymmetry and supergravity.  

The US investigator is an
              expert in string and supersymmetric theories.  This is complemented by the
              French investigators' expertise in string theory duality and compactification
              and in differential geometric description of theories of supersymmetry and
              supergravity.  The project addresses problems related to the development of a
              unified theory of all physical phenomena.
