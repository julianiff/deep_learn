This two-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              intermediate energy nuclear physics involves scientists at the University of
              Illinois' Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the Institut de
              Physique Nucleare, Universite de Paris, Sud, led by Douglas Beck and Jacques
              Arvieux.  It adds an international dimension to a NSF and Department of Energy
              experiment, the "G0" experiment.   The proposed funds will facilitate
              communications between the US and French groups during the development of a new
              $8 million spectrometer being constructed for this experiment.  The US
              investigators are responsible for the construction of the superconducting
              magnet and liquid hydrogen target for the experiment.  The French investigators
              will construct four of the eight sets of detectors and electronics for the
              spectrometer.  The experiment is scheduled for installation at Jefferson Lab
              during the summer and fall of 2000, with data taking expected to begin in early
              2001.
