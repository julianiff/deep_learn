This proposal plans
              to enhance its pre-college bridging programs and institute a post-baccalaureate
              bridge with graduate institutions. SEM faculty will develop interdisciplinary
              courses geared to enhance the understanding and relevance of the
              interconnectedness of SEM disciplines specifically for freshmen.  Coordinators
              will be assigned to freshman and sophomore SEM majors, to assist these students
              in navigating the financial and academic obstacles they may encounter.  Morgan
              will institute on-campus employment, and other incentives, for SEM majors to
              assist them in focusing on academic achievement.
