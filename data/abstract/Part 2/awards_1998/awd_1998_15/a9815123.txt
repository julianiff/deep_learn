Abstract    :
              9815123  Quave  The Cygnus Corporation presents a detailed plan to provide the
              National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Educational System Reform (ESR)
              with logistical support for the ESR Systemic Initiatives Principal Investigator
              (PI)/Project Director (PD) National Meeting.  The primary purpose for this
              meeting is to allow PIs and PDs to discuss issues critical to the successful
              implementation of systemic reform, to share best practices, and to meet with
              their cognizant program officers.    Under this plan the Cygnus Corporation
              will obtain the meeting site, handle meeting pre-registration and registration
              and arrange for all meeting logistic including meeting rooms, audio-visual
              requirement, invited speakers and other support.
