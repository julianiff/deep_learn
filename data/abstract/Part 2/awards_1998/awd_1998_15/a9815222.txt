Abstract    :
              The American Philosophical Association is supporting and disseminating
              philosophical-research into issues of science, technology and diversity through
              a dual program of-commissioned research papers and small research grants. The
              focus on science,-technology and diversity extends traditional philosophical
              concerns with the-foundations of knowledge and value into concerns with the
              conflicts and dilemmas of cultural,-racial and ethnic diversity as these
              concerns increasingly emerge through-scientific and technological development. 
              Papers will be commissioned through established APA Committees and presented in
              Committee sessions at APA Divisional Meetings during 1999-2000.  A small grant
              competition will provide support for other-philosophical research into these
              issues.  The APA plans to commission 10-15 papers-and to fund 10-15 research
              projects, with the actual balance between the two dependent-upon the proposals
              submitted by APA Committees and prospective grantees.  Bill-Lawson, a member of
              the Philosophy Department at Michigan State University, and Chair-of the APA
              Committee on Blacks, will serve as Research Coordinator, assisted by a 5-member
              Advisory Committee.  The Advisory Committee will serve-as the grant selection
              committee and advise Professor Lawson, as needed, on the-development of other
              aspects of the program.  Both the commissioned papers and the-research
              conducted under the grant program will be collected into a book, to be edited
              by-Lawson with advice from the Advisory Committee.  The National Office of the
              American-Philosophical Association, including Executive Director, Eric Hoffman,
              and appropriate-members of his staff, will handle all administrative work in
              support of the program.
