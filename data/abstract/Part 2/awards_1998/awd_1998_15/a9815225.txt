This award supports the PI, Zbigniew Celinski, co-PI Robert
              Camley, and two graduate students from the University of Colorado at Colorado
              Springs in a collaboration with Claus Schneider of the Institute for Solid
              State and Materials Research in Dresden, Germany.  The research focus is on
              connecting the magnetic properties of multilayer structures to interface
              morphology.  The combination of techniques and expertise of the U.S. and German
              groups will produce results that would not be obtainable without the
              collaboration.  The results will be important for the understanding of
              exchange-coupled structures and for designing giant magnetoresistance sensors,
              since the performance is determined by the quality of the films with respect to
              their structure and composition.  The collaboration involves the exchange of
              students as well as senior researchers.
