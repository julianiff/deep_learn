This three-year award will support US-France collaborative
              research between James Kolodzey of the University of Delaware and Jean-Michel
              Lourtioz of the Institute of Fundamental Electronics at the University of Paris
              in Orsay.  The investigators are collaborating on an approach using the
              heterojunction contacts between dissimilar semiconductors to control the
              quantum operation of electrical and optical devices.  Thus far, their research
              indicates the possibility of a new, improved laser compatible with the
              silicon-based circuits of computers.  

The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in device fabrication, and electrical and materials
              characterization.  This is complemented by French expertise in analysis,
              optical and low temperature measurements.  Their combined efforts will advance
              fundamental understanding of optical devices and could lead to the development
              of faster, more powerful computers.
