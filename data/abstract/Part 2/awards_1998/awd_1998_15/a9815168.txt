This award supports the PI's postdoctoral student, William Welsh,
              in a collaboration with Wolfram Kollatschny of the University Observatory at
              the University of Goettingen, Germany.  The research focus is on Active
              Galactic Nuclei, which are of great interest to astronomers because they are
              the most energetic sources of energy yet discovered in the universe.  Current
              explanations of the small size and high and highly variable energy output of
              these nuclei require an understanding of accretion processes onto extremely
              massive black holes.  Such processes are poorly understood, and the U.S. group
              will collaborate with the German group to analyze the latest data from the new
              Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas.  For this type of data-intense observations,
              the team approach has proved to be particularly successful, and the German
              group has unique expertise in the analysis of data from active galactic
              nuclei.
