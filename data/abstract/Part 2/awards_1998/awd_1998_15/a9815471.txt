Abstract    :
              Command-and-control regulation by single-function federal and state agencies has
              many limitations.  In response,  community-based environmental planning
              involving direct negotiations among governmental and private parties has become
              an increasingly popular strategy for resolving local environmental conflicts.  
              This project seeks to ascertain: 1) whether consensus-based negotiations are
              more successful than conventional methods in designing and implementing
              specific management projects.  2) the relative ability of three theoretical
              frameworks-Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development Framework,
              the Advocacy Coalition Framework of Paul Sabatier and Hank Jenkins-Smith, and
              Robert Putnam's Social Capital Framework-in explaining the ability of watershed
              negotiations to reach and implement legally-binding agreements. The data base
              will involve personal interviews and surveys of participants in 60 watershed
              negotiations in California.
