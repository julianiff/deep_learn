The Botteri's sparrow has almost disappeared from the
              American Southwest due to drought and overgrazing. This bird, a tallgrass
              specialist, is usually now restricted to stands of scaton grass in lowland
              areas. In this native grassland that can grow over 2 meters tall, the birds
              conceal their nests from predators at the bases of these tall grasses and then
              forage on adjacent slopes for grasshoppers and other insects. Recently, these
              birds have begun nesting in native upland grassland areas where the grasses are
              shorter than the tall stands of scaton grass, but grasshopper densities are
              high. In addition, they also nest in areas where the cover is dominated by
              introduced African lovegrass, where the cover is nearly as heavy as the native
              scaton. However, in these areas, grasshoppers are relatively scarce. This
              unique situation allows for testing of hypotheses and predictions of landscape
              ecology, sink/source and metapopulation dynamics and the ecological impacts of
              alien vegetation. This research will answer such questions as: What is the
              relative importance of grass cover (safe nesting habitat) versus food
              availability (high grasshopper numbers) to reproductive success in the Botteri
              sparrow?  What are the combined contributions of the three habitats (sacaton,
              native upland grasslands and exotic grassland) to regional population dynamics
              of the Botteri sparrow and how these relate to the sink/source status of the
              entire species population at the northern margin of its range? In addition, it
              will address whether the exotic grasslands represent a suitable habitat for the
              birds or are the introduced grasslands an ecological trap for this species.
