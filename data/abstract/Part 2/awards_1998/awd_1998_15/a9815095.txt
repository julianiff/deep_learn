Hemaspaandra
This award supports the PI, Edith Hemaspaandra, co-PI
              Lane Hemaspaandra, and a graduate student from the Rochester Institute of
              Technology in collaboration with Klaus Wagner of the Department of Information
              Technology at the University of Wuerzburg, Germany.  The goal of the research
              is to explore the complexity and applicability of the class of problems
              solvable via parallel access to NP.  Such problems are those that could be
              solved given an unlimited number of parallel processors working at the same
              time on the same problem.  This research will establish new relationships
              between several familiar real-world problems and certain classes of solutions
              that have previously been considered technical and obscure.  The German
              collaborator is well known for his work in this area and is responsible for
              some of the earliest significant work on the class of problems under study. 
              The cooperation also includes participation of younger researchers who should
              benefit greatly from the experience.
