This one-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              population biology involves David Rand of Brown University and Michel Veuille
              of the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  Their collaboration is aimed at an
              extensive characterization of genetic variation within and among Old World and
              New World populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
              simulans.  It is believed that this species originated in Africa, spread to
              European locations and more recently colonized the New World.  The presence of
              geographically dispersed populations offers a unique opportunity to test
              genetic variations that may have evolved over centuries.   In this one-year
              project, the investigators will direct their efforts towards collecting wild
              population samples from European and other old-world localities and prepare
              representative natural samples of Drosophila melanogaster for later analysis in
              each laboratory.
