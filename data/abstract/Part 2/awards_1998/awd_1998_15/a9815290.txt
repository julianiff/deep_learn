This award supports Dr. Volker Sick and one graduate student from
              the University of Michigan in a collaboration with Juergen Wolfrum of the
              Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. 
              The research funded by this award will improve laser-spectroscopic methods for
              the non-intrusive measurement of fuel and temperature distributions in
              direct-injection gasoline engines.  The collaboration brings together the
              unique expertise of the two groups.  The Heidelberg group has strong expertise
              in laser spectroscopy and quantitative diagnostic tools, and the Michigan group
              has fundamental knowledge and research experience in engine technology.  The PI
              also has strong contacts in the automotive industry, which is interested in the
              results of the research.  Much of the research will be performed by a graduate
              student from the PI's group working in Heidelberg.
