Terrestrial ecosystems typically contain species-rich
              assemblages of generalist predators.  These predators not only prey upon lower
              trophic levels but also on other species of generalist predators, an
              interaction known as intraguild predation (IGP).  These complex feeding
              connections are anticipated to blur distinctions between trophic levels and
              lead to the prediction that changes in abundances of generalist predators
              should have minimal effects on species at the base of food webs.  As a
              consequence, it has been anticipated that trophic cascades should be weak in
              terrestrial food webs with high IGP.  This research project will test this
              hypothesis in a series of field experiments manipulating spiders in the
              detritus-based food webs of forest-floor leaf litter.  Cursorial and
              web-building spiders will be enhanced or decreased in one series of experiment
              to test if predation on detritivores by spiders initiates trophic cascades that
              affect the rates at which leaf litter decomposes.    A second set of
              experiments will manipulate densities of detritivores and arthropod predators
              of the wolf spider to determine if resource limitation is more influential than
              IGP on the population dynamics of an abundant generalist predator.  This
              research will increase ecological understanding of trophic structure, control
              processes and indirect effects in a common and important terrestrial food
              web.
