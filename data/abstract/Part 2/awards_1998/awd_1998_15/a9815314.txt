Iowa State is replacing obsolete equipment with
              state-of-the-art machines, allowing dramatic improvements  in the use of
              UNIDATA products in both teaching and research.  The primary Internet
              Distribution Data relay node computer will be replaced.  The objective of this
              award is to obtain amodern PC to improve Iowa State's position as a data relay
              node.  The second objective of this award  is to obtain two servers, to be used
              in a pooled mode, which will provide access to archived weather products which
              support the archived forecast activity.
