This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              materials science involves Gary Long and a graduate student from the University
              of Missouri at Rolla and Olivier Isnard of the Laboratoire de Cristallographie,
              Universite de Grenoble.  Their research is focused on electronic and magnetic
              interactions in intermetallic compounds.  The researchers will determine the
              electronic and magnetic properties of rare earth compounds and their hydrides. 
              The presence of hydrogen or deuterium in these compounds is known to
              dramatically change their magnetic properties.  How these changes are produced
              by the presence of hydrogen will advance understanding of magnetic interactions
              in rare earth permanent magnets.

This collaboration takes advantage of
              complementary Mossbauer Effect Laboratories in the US and France.  The US
              researcher brings to this collaboration expertise in the synthetic, magnetic,
              and structural studies.  This is complemented by French expertise in spectral
              analysis techniques.
