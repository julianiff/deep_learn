This award supports Drs. Dwight Adams and Yasumasa Takano and
              one or two graduate students from the University of Florida in a collaboration
              with Konrad Siemensmeyer of the Hahn Meitner Institute in Berlin, Germany.  The
              research funded by this award will focus on the study of magnetically ordered
              solid 3He using neutron scattering and transmission.  The planned experiments
              will provide information crucial for a full understanding of exchange processes
              in a fundamental magnetic system, because at low pressure, solid 3He exhibits
              two different magnetic phases at temperatures less than 0.9 mK.  This unusual
              behavior can be interpreted using what is known as a multiple-exchange model. 
              This award will allow the investigators to study the high-field phase of solid
              3He, which has never been analyzed using neutron scattering.  The collaboration
              between researchers at Florida and Hahn Meitner is ideal for achieving the
              objective of the proposed work.  The Florida group has extensive experience
              with solid 3He, especially in growing crystals and cooling them to the
              necessary low temperatures and the Hahn Meitner Institute has the only neutron
              facility in the world capable of cascade cooling to the temperatures necessary
              for achieving the proper crystal ordering.
