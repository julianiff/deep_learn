This award supports the PI, William Torruellas, and two
              postdoctoral students from Washington State University in a collaboration with
              Falk Lederer of the Institute for Solid State Theory and Theoretical Optics at
              the University of Jena, Germany, and with Alain Barthelemy of the Institute for
              Optical and Microwave Communications at the University of Limoges, France.  The
              research focus is on fabrication of micro-cavity polymer thin films that will
              make possible the experimental demonstration of nonlinear optical patterns and
              solitary waves.  This unique multilateral collaboration brings together the
              expertise of the U.S. group in polymer-based devices, the pioneering work of
              the French lab in spatial soliton generation, and the theoretical expertise of
              the German group.  The collaboration includes extensive participation by
              students from all three universities, and it is expected that the collaboration
              will expand to include other departments within all three instituions.
