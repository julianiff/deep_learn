This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in polymer materials involves Rudolf Faust of the University of
              Massachusetts and Jean-Pierre Vairon of the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie. 
              The objective of the research is to determine the kinetic and thermodynamic
              parameters of polymers via cationic routes. The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise on the engineering of polymers.  This is complemented
              by the French investigator's expertise in the kinetics and mechanistic studies
              of polymers.  The collaboration also takes advantage of a unique, custom
              designed stop-flow device with UV-vis detection for fast reactions at the
              Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  The research will advance understanding of
              polymer structures and the elementary steps in polymerization.  This knowledge
              is essential for synthesis of tailor-made polymers.  Designer polymers have
              medical applications and can be used in drug delivery systems.
