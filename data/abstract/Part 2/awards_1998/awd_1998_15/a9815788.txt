This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              materials research involves Harry Tuller of Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology and Philippe Knauth of the Universite de Marseille.  It adds an
              international dimension to a GOALI grant with Ford Motor Company's Research
              Laboratories on the utilization of nanostructured, semiconducting ceramic
              oxides. The international project will investigate nanocomposites for enhanced
              ionic conduction.  High ionic conductivity is key to developing advanced
              batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and electrocatalysts.  The US investigator
              brings to this collaboration expertise in ionic conductors and thermodynamic
              theory.  This is complemented by French expertise in electrochemical
              measurements and in the preparation and characterization of ionic conductor
              composites and nanostructured materials.
