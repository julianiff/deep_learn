This three-year award in support of U.S.-France
              collaborative research in applied mathematics and fluid mechanics involves
              Yuriko Renardy and Michael Renardy of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University and Stephane Zaleski of Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  Their
              collaboration addresses the numerical resolution of the shape of the interface
              separating two or more immiscible liquids.  Their objective is the development
              of software for 3D transient simulations of the interface shapes.  The US
              investigators bring to this collaboration expertise on physical modeling,
              analytical and computational techniques for study of stability of interface
              shapes and the appearance of new arrangements from unstable ones.  This is
              complemented by French expertise in numerical simulation and the extension of
              French developed codes to two-fluid flow problems.  The research results have
              potential industrial applications in the processing of bicomponent fibers from
              polymers and pipelining of viscous crude oil.
