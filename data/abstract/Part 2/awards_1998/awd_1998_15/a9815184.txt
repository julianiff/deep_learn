              ABSTRACT  Proposal Title:  Proposal for a Pan-American Workshop to      Promote
              Collaboration in Chemical and Bio-Engineering  Proposal Number:  CTS-9815184 
              Principal Investigator: Ignacio E. Grossmann  Institution: Carnegie Mellon
              University    An international workshop to discuss and recommend new mechanisms
              for international research and education collaboration in areas of common
              interest within Chemical and Biochemical Engineering disciplines will be
              conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 3-5, 1998. The workshop will be
              attended by approximately sixty participants from four countries: Argentina,
              Brazil, Chile and the USA. The workshop will also discuss and recommend the 
              technological areas of largest potential for mutual scientific and economic
              benefits. Particular emphasis will be made in the disciplines of interfacial
              science, thermodynamics, separations, catalysis, reaction engineering, process
              systems engineering, and biotechnology. The scope will encompass applications
              to energy, environment, and food technologies, and to chemical, renewable
              resource and mineral and materials processing. This grant is cofunded by the
              Divisions of Chemical and Transport Systems, Bioengineering and Environmental
              Systems, and International Programs.
