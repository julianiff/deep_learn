Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9873196  Trotter    The procurement of a CAVE will allow the
              ERC 's computational infrastructure to advance the understanding of the output
              of the numerous simulations and data sets processed by the Center.  It will
              allow the Center to better contribute to advancing the knowledge and technology
              base in virtual environments.    The focus projects are drawn from application
              areas related to ongoing ERC research.  The application areas are flow about
              manufactured objects (propulsors, propellers, and moving vehicles), i.e., CFD
              applications, meteorology and oceanography (METOC) visualization environments,
              and visualization of remotely sensed data.    The research issues underlying
              these applications concentrate on distributed, multiresolutional
              representations and visualization, compression, and  human-computer interfaces
              (HCI) and human-factor issues.    The first two areas of research will be
              addressed predominantly by the members of the Scientific Visualization Thrust
              of the ERC.  The last research area will be addressed in collaboration with
              faculty from the Cognitive Engineering and Systems Laboratory (CESL) and the
              Institute for Signal and Information Processing (ISSP).    The CAVE will also
              be used as an educational tool.  The ERC will include its use in existing
              courses and will institute new course devoted to virtual environments.
