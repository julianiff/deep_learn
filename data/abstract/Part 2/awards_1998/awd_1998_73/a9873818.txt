Abstract    :
              John Stanton is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              to develop and apply quantum chemical methods to the study of potential energy
              surfaces and spectroscopy.  His research contains a mix of formal method
              development, computational implementation, and applications of current interest
              to experiment.  Methodological developments include analytic second derivatives
              for coupled cluster theory, as well as gradients for excited state and
              open-shell theories.  Applications include the overtone spectroscopy of
              benzene, the photoelectron spectrum of the formic acid anion, and electronic
              excited states of carbenes.

Accurate simulations of molecular spectroscopy
              are often necessary to investigate property and structural issues in molecules.
              For example, theoretical studies of the photochemistry of atmospheric and
              interstellar species assist in their characterization and detection by
              spectroscopic techniques.  Current computational methodologies are often
              limited, however, by their inability to treat large molecules and/or large
              regions of potential energy surfaces.  This research is intended to address
              these deficiencies.
