Abstract    :
              Peter Rossky is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research on quantum simulation of chemical
              dynamics in solution.  He will the continue the development of theoretical and
              computational techniques to study solvent effects on excited state dynamics of
              chemical systems in nonaqueous solvents.  The role of environmental dynamics on
              solute quantum state amplitude coherence and dephasing will be explored using
              the instantaneous normal mode description of condensed phase dynamics. 
              Applications include the study of the spectroscopy and electron transfer
              dynamics of betaine-30 in acetonitrile and methanol solvents and the solution
              phase bimolecular complex between tetracyanoethylene and hexamethylbenzene. 
              Theoretical treatments will be used to interpret the considerable ultrafast
              time resolved and resonance Raman data for these systems. 

The fact that
              most chemical reactions occur in solution provides a strong impetus for both
              experimental and theoretical research to elucidate the molecular motions that
              determine the course of a chemical reaction and that influence the energy flow
              within the solute and between the solute and its environment.  A detailed
              molecular understanding of the role that solvation plays in chemical reactions
              could have a significant  impact on the optimization of a number of commercial
              synthetic processes.
