Abstract    :
              This award in Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry supports
              research on metal-metal bonding in transition metal compounds by Dr. F. Albert
              Cotton, Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University.  New dinuclear compounds
              with multiple metal bonds will be synthesized and structurally characterized. 
              Of particular interest are compounds containing V, Nb, Ta, Fe and Mn, for which
              few examples of this bonding motif are known.  The strategy is to synthesize
              ligands with binding sites that force the metals into the desired
              configuration.  Emphasis will also be placed on compounds that have unusual
              oxidation states or structural features.  In addition, species that contain
              chains of three or more metals atoms with conducting properties will be
              prepared.  

Compounds that contain two metal atoms linked together are of
              interest because of their unusual bonding behavior.  They have been used as
              catalysts and for determining absolute configuration.  In this study, the
              limits of metal-metal bonding will be tested with metals that have not
              exhibited this type of bonding previously.  Compounds consisting of chains of
              metals are of interest in understanding metallic behavior and designing
              compounds with specific electronic properties.
