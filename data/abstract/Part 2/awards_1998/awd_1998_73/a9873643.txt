Abstract    :
              This project will investigate dynamic and physical processes in continental
              stratocumulus clouds using existing data sets from millimeter-wave radars and
              other remote and in situ instruments.  Emphasis in the analysis will be on
              differences between the structure of these clouds and maritime stratocumulus
              clouds, which are thought to be better understood.  Stratocumulus clouds are
              important because they are widespread and frequently occurring and can affect
              the transfer of solar and infrared radiation in the atmosphere.  Central to the
              project is the use of vertically-pointing radar for estimating vertical air
              motions and the composition of the clouds, in particular the concentration of
              condensed water, the number density of drops, and the average drop size, all as
              functions of time and height.  Accordingly, part of the effort will go to
              developing methods to improve these estimates, by combined use of a microwave
              radiometer and a laser ceilometer along with the radar.  The goal of the
              project is to provide the data needed to evaluate and improve the numerical
              simulations produced by cloud models and large eddy simulations of the
              atmospheric boundary layer.  Collaboration is planned with specialists in large
              eddy simulation to insure that the observations will be in a form suitable for
              comparison with the models.
