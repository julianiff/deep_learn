This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in signal processing involves Kenneth Sauer of the University of Notre
              Dame and Ali Mohammad-Djatari of the Ecole Superieure d' Electricite.  The
              objective of their research is the development of tomographic measurements and
              nondestructive techniques for image reconstruction.  They will develop
              algorithms for defect detection and analysis and will focus on two algorithmic
              and modeling approaches for three-dimensional reconstruction from predominately
              X-ray data.  The project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the
              US and French investigators and the different algorithmic and modeling
              approaches developed by the French investigator.  

Nondestructive testing
              can be used to identify and inspect defective objects having faults that are
              not visible from the exterior.  The design of computerized reconstruction
              algorithms, the principal goal of this project, translates critical information
              extracted by certain media, into visualizations.  These algorithms will be
              useful in the inspection of infrastructure, transportation systems,
              manufacturing materials, and archeological and paleontological objects.
