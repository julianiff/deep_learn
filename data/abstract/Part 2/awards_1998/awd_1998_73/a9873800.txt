Reed College has been selected as one of ten recipients of
              the National Science Foundation's Awards for the Integration of Research and
              Education.  The College has been committed to the integration of research and
              education since its inception. This commitment has been reaffirmed throughout
              the curriculum, beginning with investigative experiences in introductory
              laboratory courses and culminating with the College's mandatory year-long
              senior thesis, which must involve collaborative research with a faculty member.
               Along with the senior thesis, the mandatory comprehensive junior qualifying
              examination is another crucial element of Reed's approach to the integration of
              research and education.  

The College's efforts to integrate research and
              education were designed with the following outcomes: providing support for
              faculty as both scientists and teachers; promoting student-faculty
              collaboration in actual scientific research; integrating research into the
              curriculum at every level, from introductory courses through the senior thesis,
              and providing the appropriate physical infrastructure support to facilitate
              research and teaching.

Reed College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance
              institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and
              disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration
              of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming
              three years.  To enhance their successful program, the institution will
              establish an innovative Undergraduate Research Mentor Program focusing on
              peer-mentoring to supplement activities of faculty by helping develop research
              skills for students who are "new" to science.  This novel and potential
              effective model will attract talented students to academic careers and engage
              them early in the scientific enterprise.
