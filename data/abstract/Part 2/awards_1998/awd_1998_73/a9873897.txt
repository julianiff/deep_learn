Abstract    :
              J. Vincent Ortiz is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry program to perform ab initio electron propagator calculations on
              molecular anions.   Ortiz will make a number of methodological and algorithmic
              improvements in the P3 self-energy approximation including the development of a
              paralellized version of the algorithm.  Extensions of the electron propagator
              theory to the treatment electron affinities, shake-ups in photoelectron
              spectra, core ionization energies, and Auger spectra will also be pursued.  In
              an effort to provide links to other quantum mechanical approaches to electronic
              structure theory, Ortiz will also develop interpretive tools such as the
              extraction of effective Hamiltonians, and an interpretation of ground state
              correlation energies based on electron density and local correlation potential.
               Applications include: 1) an examination of possible dipole-bound and
              valence-bound states of water-uracil anionic complex to explain photoelectron
              spectra and charge exchange collisions with highly excited atoms in Rydberg
              states; 2) a study of the ionic abundance behavior and thermochemistry of metal
              carbide anions; and 3) a prediction of the photoelectron spectra, structures
              and energetic properties of double Rydberg anions.

Development of
              theoretical methods such as those proposed by Ortiz will help researchers in
              all fields to perform accurate calculations of the molecular and ionic
              properties of technologically important molecular species.
