Abstract    :
                9873557  Szeto  The 20th IEEE/EMBS (Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
              Engineers/Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society)  Annual International
              Conference, to be held in Hong Kong,  October 29-November 1, 1998, includes the
              two mini-symposia  of Biosensors and Biomechanical Micro-Electromechanical 
              Systems in its program.  The mini-symposia will introduce  prospective 
              investigators to the state-of-the-science in  these increasingly important
              areas of biomedical engineering  research.    Support is being provided to
              cover partial travel costs for  15 speaker-participants in the mini-symposia. 
              Individuals  who receive support are to be selected based on the  following
              criteria: participation in the mini-symposia;  young investigators; diversity
              (gender; minority; disabled);  organizers.    Participants in the mini-symposia
              will learn about current  research that will contribute to the development of 
              technologies that will lead to new applications in medicine.  Each recipient of
              support is to submit a report to the  Division of Bioengineering and
              Environmental Systems  describing the research discussed at the mini-symposia 
              having the greatest potential for dramatically influencing  the development of
              new medical technologies.  ***
