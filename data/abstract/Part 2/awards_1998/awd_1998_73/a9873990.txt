Abstract    :
              William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical studies of organic reactions in
              solution.  Jorgensen will extend his previous work in this area in three new
              directions: 1) he will seek an improved computational model for liquid water
              that can reproduce experimental densities over large ranges of temperature and
              pressure; 2) he will develop Monte Carlo simulation approaches using linear
              response theory to perform rapid prediction of molecular properties including
              free energies of hydration and octanol / water partition coefficients; 3) he
              will seek to improve the methodology for combined quantum and molecular
              mechanics calculations including the extension of current semi-empirical
              molecular orbital techniques to second row atoms containing d electrons.  These
              techniques will be applied to several organic reactions including: 1)
              biosynthesis of lanosterol; 2) Michael additions of thiolates; and 3) halide
              selectivity for calixpyrroles.

This research is important for the
              elucidation of molecular-level effects of solvation on reaction rates,
              intermolecular interactions and host-guest binding in solution, and the
              influence of solvation on the structures and reactivity of molecules. The
              theoretical studies closely parallel and complement experimental work on the
              optimization of organic reactions and on the development of catalysts,
              selective receptors for organic molecules including drugs and metabolites,
              materials with novel properties, and molecular devices.
