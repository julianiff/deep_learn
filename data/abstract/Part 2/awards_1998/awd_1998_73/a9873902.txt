Abstract    :
              This research involves the development of an experimental prototype of a quantum
              cryptographically protected communication system using two-photon entangled
              states of light, and a detailed theoretical study of the physical principles
              underlining the ultimate security of this technique.  The exponentially growing
              flow of private and confidential data transmitted over telecommunication
              channels has brought with it the need for its protection to insure the security
              of sensitive information.  Conventional encryption based on the mathematical
              complexity of factoring large numbers is still vulnerable to the intrusion of
              an unfriendly party in command of large computational power.  Quantum
              cryptography was designed to address this issue by bringing to bear the power
              of the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics.  

There are two major
              approaches in quantum crytography which, historically, appeared nearly
              simultaneously.  One makes use of near single-photon states derived from
              coherent-state light.  The other relies on the nonlocal character of two-photon
              entangled states generated in the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous
              parametric down conversion.  A new scheme for quantum cryptography has been
              designed which overcome the limitations that have heretofore plagued the latter
              systems for use in cryptography, particularly the requirement for synchronous
              manipulation of two Mach-Zehnder interferometers that are well separated in
              space.  This new approach is based on the use of a special polarization quantum
              intensity interferometer and utilized doubly entangled states generated by
              type-II spontaneous parametric down conversion.
