Title:
              Mechanisms of Climate Variability and Change

The proposed work will
              investigate climate variability and sensitivity mechanisms on intraseasonal to
              interannual time scales. The natural low-frequency variability generated within
              the atmosphere and its interaction with the oceanic mixed layer will be studied
              using observations as well as a hierarchy of models. The tropical intraseasonal
              oscillation and its interaction with midlatitude weather anomalies will also be
              investigated.  Dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms for setting the long time
              scale of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation will be tested using variations
              on the NCAR CCM3 GCM; these will be compared to the observational analysis.
              Interactions between clouds, radiation, SST and atmospheric circulation and the
              effect on tropical climate will also be investigated using a hierarchy of
              models. The work is important since an improved understanding of dynamics of
              the climate system in the middle latitudes and tropics has benefits both from a
              theoretical as well as  practical point of view.
