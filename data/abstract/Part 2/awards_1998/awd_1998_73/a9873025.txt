Abstract    :
              Collaborative Knowledge-Work Environments for Team
Science: The Space Physics
              and Aeronomy Research
Collaboratory (SPARC) Project

              Summary

Interdisciplinary research experience in the collaboratory concept
              will be used to design, deploy, evaluate, and enlarge the fundamental
              understanding of collaborative knowledge-work environments.  They will focus
              and inform this research by the creation of a Space Physics and Aeronomy
              Research Collaboratory (SPARC) of revolutionary scope and power.  The work is
              based on the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC), in which over a
              six-year period a team of space physicists, computer scientists, and behavioral
              scientists evolved a suite of collaboration capabilities to provide rich,
              real-time access to a wide variety of data and modeling resources.  The
              proposed work on SPARC will significantly extend the power of
              technology-mediated, distributed knowledge-networking systems.  It combines
              experimental data streams and their interpretation, theoretical models,
              real-time campaign support, capture mid replay of collaborative sessions,
              post-hoc analysis workshops, access to archival data and digital libraries, and
              educational/outreach modules.  An important outcome of SPARC for the science
              community will be a functional and operational space weather predictive
              capability.  Equally important, SPARC will also be a major testbed to further
              understand and design collaborative knowledge work systems from a merger of
              social and technical principles.

The SPARC project aims to produce a next
              generation collaboratory that will support a fill range of scientific
              activities
