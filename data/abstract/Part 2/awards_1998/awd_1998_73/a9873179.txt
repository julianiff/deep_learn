The investigators will analyze Rayleigh lidar observations from
              the Starfire facility in New Mexico and the Millstone Hill facility in
              Massachusetts.  The goal is to develop a phenomenological description of wind
              and temperature profiles of the mesosphere inversion layer and to supplement
              this with theoretical calculations.  The lidar measurements provide temperature
              profiles in the middle atmosphere, from which researchers will deduce the
              density perturbations, potential energy, and spectra of atmospheric gravity
              waves.  These results will be examined to determine whether monochromatic
              gravity waves of 10 to 15 km vertical wave lengths are essential to generate
              inversion layers through the coupling of these waves with the mesosphere tidal
              structure.
