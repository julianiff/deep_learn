This project will focus on the investigation of new magnetic
              oxides with low-dimensional structure, and on understanding the
              interrelationships among structure, composition and magnetic behavior.  In
              addition, the synthetic methodology for preparing incommensurate composite
              structures will be developed, and the nature of structural disorder and how it
              affects magnetic behavior will be investigated systematically to understand the
              interconnectedness between magnetic properties of commensurate and
              incommensurate structures.  The growth of both commensurate and incommensurate
              single crystal phases will allow the collection of magnetic data on
              crystallographically oriented materials.

Studying the magnetic properties
              of solids, especially oxides, provide an opportunity to develop the first
              generation of "spin" electronics involving new materials which have the
              potential to rival current transistor-based materials.   These novel materials
              are strongly influencing new directions being taken in other areas of condensed
              matter sciences.
