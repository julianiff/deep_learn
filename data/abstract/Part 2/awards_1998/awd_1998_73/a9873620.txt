Abstract    :
              The proposed research seeks to understand when and if immersive virtual
              environments make it easier for students to understand complex ecological
              processes compared to what they can learn from desktop simulations and other
              experiences.  The immersive and non-immersive learning materials will be built
              from databases and models developed by the PRISM project.  This project models
              environmental interactions in the Puget Sound.

The framework that guides
              this project is built from an understanding of three properties of VEs; their
              ability to induce "presence" in users; their ability to support extensive,
              natural interactions with objects; and thier ability to make accessible to the
              senses events that are normally undetectable.  These properties of VEs have the
              potential of supporting constructivist approaches to teaching and learning and
              thus helping students develop scientifically correct mental models of
              scientific phenomena.

The study will focus primarily on college age
              students.  However, in the latter part of the study, they will include high
              school seniors.
