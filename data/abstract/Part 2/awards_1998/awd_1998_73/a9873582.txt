Abstract    :
              9873582 Lave The objective of this research is to develop quantitative measures
              of the environmental impacts of selected service sector industries: trucking
              and courier services, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and other lodging
              places and educational services.  The existing economic input-output life-cycle
              assessment (EIO-LCA) approach will be employed to identify and quantify the
              environmental implications of these industries throughout the lifetime of their
              products and services, as well as to identify and quantify the direct and
              indirect economic, environmental and sustainablility implications of these
              industries.  The material and energy inputs (nonrenewable and renewable
              resources) will be assessed, as well as the emissions and waste (toxic
              discharges, hazardous waste generation, criteria pollutant emissions,
              greenhouse gas discharges and ozone-depleting chemical releases) associated
              with the service economy.  Opportunities for environmental improvements of
              service sector outputs will be evaluated with the objective of providing
              metrics and analysis tools that can help define industrial ecology in the
              service sectors. This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent
              Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998.
