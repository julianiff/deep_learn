Abstract    :
              Next-Generation Agent Based Distributed Simulation

Project Summary

This
              study will examine how distributed simulations are created and managed online
              so that they can be shared, used, augmented, coordinated, and enhanced in a
              highly decentralized way.  The fundamental elements of this research will be to
              1) study new approaches to effectively manage operational simulations and data
              assimilation over a distributed set of clients, 2) implement the technologies
              that will enable this distributed approach, and 3) evaluate these technologies
              using real-world experiments.  The PI's envisage operational simulations to
              include scientific, environmental, public infrastructure, and other computer
              simulations that operate continuously and online, assessing the current state
              of a system and predicting future states.  Distributed data assimilation is
              defined as the ability of a simulation to incorporate new sources of data
              dynamically while the simulation is operational.  Examples include air traffic
              control, financial systems, and weather and ocean forecasting.  The ability to
              easily combine simulations within and across such applications areas,
              asynchronously and remotely, is a goal of the proposed activity and would
              represent a major advance in knowledge networking and distributed
              intelligence.
