Abstract    :
              Janet Del Bene and Meredith Jordan are supported by a grant from the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program and the Division of International Programs
              at NSF.  The anharmonic treatment of vibration is necessary to understand and
              assign the complex infrared spectra of hydrogen-bonded complexes in which the
              hydrogen-bonded proton excutes large-amplitude motion.  This research will
              develop and extend the accurate treatment of anharmonicity, and will also
              investigate the effect of matrices on the infrared spectra of hydrogen-bonded
              complexes.

Hydrogen bonding determines the properties of systems ranging
              from condensed water to complex biomolecules. Despite extensive studies, there
              are still important unresolved questions about the significance and
              interpretation of experimental infrared spectra and about the theoretical
              understanding of the hydrogen-bonding character.  This work will provide the
              scientific community with new and more powerful tools for examining hydrogen
              bonding in a variety of chemical and biological systems.
