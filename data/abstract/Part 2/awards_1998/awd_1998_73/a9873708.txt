This project will continue a long-term, large-scale
              experimental manipulation examining the importance of biotic interactions
              including predation, interspecific competition and herbivory in a Chilean
              semiarid community. This project would continue the longest large-scale
              experimental study of abiotic and biotic factors in the temperate neotropics
              and would help to understanding the importance of ecological scale,
              metapopulation dynamics, and abiotic vs. biotic processes in this important but
              little known system. Due to the long-term nature of this research the effects
              of biotic variability on community dynamics, via ENSO are being addressed. 
              Experiments include the testing of the importance of "bottom-up" forces on
              small mammals. Studies of seed rain and granivory, nutrients, mycorrhiza and
              metapopulation dynamics will also be initiated in this proposed round of
              research.
