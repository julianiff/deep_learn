Abstract    :
              Joel Bowman is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              for studies in chemical reaction dynamics.  The three projects being pursued
              under this grant are quantum dynamics calculations of unimolecular dissociation
              on the hypochlorous acid potential energy surface, coupled-channel scattering
              calculations of collision-induced isomerization and energy transfer in hydrogen
              cynanide, and development of the molecular vibrational multi-mode method into a
              freely distributed computer code.

The long term goal of this effort is to
              address important gas phase chemical reactions, especially those which occur in
              the atmosphere and in combustion processes.  A detailed understanding is sought
              for the motion of molecules as they undergo reaction, isomerization, energy
              transfer, and general interactions with other molecules and with light. 
              Software will be developed to predict, interpret, and guide experiments that
              also explore these processes.
