Project Summary

New theoretical and computational techniques
              will be developed that combine research in mathematics, computer science, and
              the geophysical sciences.  Understanding and controlling modern physical
              systems typically requires numerical simulations of multiscale dynamics that
              occur over a wide range of time and space scales.  It is generally
              prohibitively expensive (e.g., a great deal of computational time) to simulate
              all of the scales involved in many naturally occurring phenomena.  Scales
              outside the computable range must be described by a reduced model that
              conscientiously represent the effects of the unresolved degrees of freedom on
              the resolved scales.  These models may also have constraints that provide
              reduced descriptions of the interactions with other systems.  The goal of this
              study will be to develop both the model reduction techniques and new algorithms
              to address these problems.
