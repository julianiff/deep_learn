Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a vision of the global manufacturing economy connected
              through Internet and telecommunications technology.  Manufacturing companies
              will cost-effectively design new products
in direct collaboration with
              customers.  The global information infrastructure will enable groups of
              companies to organize themselves into virtual corporations and configure custom
              networks to support their collective activities.  Supporting engineering and
              manufacturing activity in this future vision requires highly
interactive
              technologies to conceptualize, design, test, plan, fabricate, and serve
              products: Virtual and Interactive Prototyping (VIP).  There are three
              multi-disciplinary thrusts to achieve these goals: (1) Collaborative
              negotiation for engineering decision making; (2) Proactive design and
              simulation software systems; and (3) Design knowledge repositories, for
              archival and reuse of complex experience.  VIP is a fruit of the growth in
              computer power and networking connectivity, and will dramatically reshape
              the
relationships among creators and consumers.  VIP increases the
              effectiveness of engineering teams, industry organizations and consumer
              communities that work together across distances and over time to rapidly and
              economically produce the most desirable products.
