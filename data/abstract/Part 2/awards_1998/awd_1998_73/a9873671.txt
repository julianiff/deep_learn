Abstract    :
              This award funds an NSF Research Planning Workshop on Self-reconfiguring Robots,
              to be held in the   Fall of 1998 at the Minary Center, New Hampshire.  The
              workshop will investigate the scientific and   engineering challenges in
              building and using self-reconfiguring robots to increase the flexibility of 
              robot systems.  Self-reconfiguring robots consist of a set of identical modules
              that can dynamically and   autonomously reconfigure in a variety of shapes, to
              best fit the terrain the robot has to navigate, the shape   of the object the
              robt has to manipulate, or the sensing needs of the task.  A modular robotic
              structure that   can metamorphose into a different geometric structure by
              reorganizing internally its modules supports  multiple modalities of
              navigation, manipulation, and sensing.  Self-reconfiguration provides a
              paradigm   shift for studying the fundamental principles of organization and
              reorganization in physical systems. In  robotics, self-reconfiguration defines
              a rich class of questions about designing, controlling, and using   massively
              distributed systems of robots.  The scientific foundations of
              self-reconfiguring robotics are only  beginning to emerge.  Progress in this
              field will be enabled by advances in mechanical design, distributed   systems,
              and planning.  The workshop on self-reconfiguring robotics will bring together
              leading  experts in this field to discuss the current state of the field and to
              set short term and long term research   goals. A summary of the discussion will
              be provided as a Web site and as a Dartmouth computer  science technical
              report.
