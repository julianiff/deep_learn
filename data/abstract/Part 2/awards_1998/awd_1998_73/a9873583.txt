The
              Practice of School Leadership and the Improvement of
Mathematics and Science
              Instruction in Urban Elementary Schools


Using a theoretical model of
              distributed leadership; the project seeks to generate a comprehensive model of
              leadership practices in schools.  The research program seeks to identify and
              explore relations between leadership practice and teachers∆ efforts to improve
              mathematics and science education.  The proposal states that leadership in an
              effective school can be from principals and other formally designated staff. 
              However, it is often the case the leader is a teacher or other staff person. 
              The study also seeks to understand how the leader and the followers affect each
              other in a dynamic process. The study also theorizes there may be differences
              in the relationship of leaders to the improvement of mathematics instruction as
              compared to science instruction. 

The project will conduct a series of case
              studies of schools in the Chicago area that are considered effective.   The
              work will consist of intensive site visits, analysis of student achievement on
              a variety of measures, interviews with parents, teachers, school administrators
              and staff of the Chicago Urban Systemic Initiative.

The PI plans to
              disseminate findings of the study to the Chicago school system in meetings and
              to the school community through publications and presentations to appropriate
              professional organizations.
