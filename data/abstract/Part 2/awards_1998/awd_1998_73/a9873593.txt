Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a three-year project to study the control of
              ice-till interactions on the evolution and stability of ice streams and ice
              sheets.  As part of this project, an extensively tested
numerical ice stream
              model will be merged with a new physical framework for treatment of sub-ice
              stream processes which control the commencement, evolution, and cessation of
              ice streaming.  This framework, called the undrained-plastic -bed (UPB) model,
              is based on observations of physical condition beneath Ice Stream B, in West
              Antarctica.  This model will be applied to the drainage basins of Ice Streams B
              and E to test four important hypotheses: 1) that the model can reproduce the
              main features of the observed ice stream velocity distribution; 2) that the
              model may produce a relatively abrupt ice stream stoppage; 3) that a
              significant imbalance of the West Antarctic ice streams may be caused in the
              near future by internal instabilities and 4) that imbalance of the ice streams
              may also be caused by either an increase in ice surface temperature or a
              doubling of snow accumulation rates.  The proposed research will provide an
              important new advancement in the science of ice sheet modeling, while yielding
              predictions on ice stream behavior that may become testable in the near
              future.
