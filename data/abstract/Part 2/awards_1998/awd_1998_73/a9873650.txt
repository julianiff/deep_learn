This research will provide important contributions to
              both empirical and theoretical research areas in the field of ecology.  This
              work also represents an important development and extension of individual-based
              simulations of ecological systems, which is an increasingly popular theoretical
              approach. The research will build upon past modeling work that used a simple
              analytic resource-consumer model that examined two consumer species competing
              for a common structure resource. The goal of this proposal is to uncover the
              individual-scale interactions and processes that lead to evolutionarily stable
              coexistence of exploitation competitors. It will develop criteria and make
              predictions to classify and compare empirical systems according to coexistence
              expectations.  Or in other words, is there a critically important feature that
              determines coexistence and do empirical systems with and without this feature
              conform to the resultant coexistence predictions?  This research represents an
              important and extension of simulations of ecological systems in which
              simulation models are used in conjunction with a range of analytic models to
              maximize theoretical insight.
