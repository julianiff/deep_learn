Abstract    :
              9873589 Theis The objective of this research is to develop a thermodynamic basis
              for life-cycle-analysis (LCA) that overcomes several of the obstacles that
              currently limit its applicability to problems of industrial ecology and to
              provide a theoretical framework for quantifying the potential environmental
              impact of industrial systems.  This research will utilize the concept of
              exergy, which combines the first and second laws of thermodynamics, to track
              material and energy resource demands, to identify the potential for reuse and
              reclamation of waste products, and to estimate the environmental burden of a
              specific real-world semiconductor manufacturing process. Finely, a computer
              model of the manufacturing process will be constructed to create a 'virtual
              laboratory' wherein various alternatives or scenarios can be tested
              systematically.  It is anticipated that this research will realize the seminal
              vision of industrial ecology wherein industrial systems can be optimized for
              material and energy demands and while being designed for minimal environmental
              impact.  It will develop a new analytical tool with a sound scientific basis
              that can be applied to an industrial ecosystem, a single facility or a single
              process.  It will test the efficacy of this approach on a real semiconductor
              manufacturing process and generate recommendations for improvement within the
              context of industrial ecology.  This grant is made pursuant to the joint
              NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program
              1998.
