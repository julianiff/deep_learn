Abstract    :
              Akos Vertes of George Washington University and Robert Johnson of the University
              of Virginia are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to pursue molecular dynamics simulations of matrix-assisted
              laser desorption ionization.  They will simulate ablation of small
              macromolecular guests from small molecule host matrices and water ice matrices.
               The simulations will employ realistic large-molecule systems with newly
              derived force fields, and small-molecule systems with more accurate anharmonic
              potentials.  The effects of selected infrared excitation, charge states,
              excitation density, and external electric fields will be investigated.

The
              most accurate spectroscopic methods depend on the subject molecules being in
              the gas phase.  Large biomolecules are difficult-to-impossible to evaporate
              since they tend to decompose before reaching high temperatures.  A recent
              experimental technique called matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
              bypasses this problem by embedding large molecules into an easy-to-evaporate
              matrix that can be excited by pulsed laser radiation.  This method provides
              unprecedented accuracy in the molecular mass determination of large proteins. 
              Despite the advantages of this method, knowledge of the underlying processes is
              lagging.  Improved understanding of the basic phenomena involved will help
              extend the capabilities of this technique to important new classes of
              biomolecules.
