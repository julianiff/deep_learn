The early history of birds, the most diverse group of
              extant land vertebrates, has long been a matter of intense scientific scrutiny.
               Until recently, scientists have had to rely on the scant fossil evidence
              available from just a few known species of the Mesozoic Era to draw conclusions
              about the historical relationships of early birds.  Lately, however, the
              situation has changed dramatically with the discovery of many new Mesozoic bird
              species.  A wealth of new evidence is now available for analysis and
              interpretation.  This project will include a comprehensive genealogical study
              of all available species of early birds.  It will include anatomical studies of
              species including some as yet undescribed, and build upon existing genealogical
              analyses of early birds. The work will yield new hypotheses of relationships
              for all species of early birds (approximately 40 so far known).
