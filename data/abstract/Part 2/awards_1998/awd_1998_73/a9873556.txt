Abstract    :
              It is well known that water is produced at the bed of an ice sheet when the
              temperature of the bed reaches the pressure melting point. The current ice
              sheet model, with its ability to calculate temperatures
throughout the ice
              sheet, is also able to calculate melt rates at the bed. By incorporating a
              model of the continuity equation for the basal-water flow, this project will
              attempt to follow the movement of this water
under the ice sheet as it flows
              from source regions to sink regions.  The ability to predict wet-based regions
              is important to the understanding of the occurrence of the sliding mechanism,
              which is thought to control ice stream dynamics.  The primary task will be to
              ascribe physical meaning to the parameters of the basal-water continuity
              equation. This will involve extracting, from  observational evidence, the laws
              governing the flow of subglacial water.  These will need to capture the essence
              of the underlying physics and yet remain simple enough to be treatable within
              the discretized and generalized snapshot of reality provided by
numerical
              simulations.   The primary effort will focus on compiling and analyzing the
              existing observational and theoretical constraints on ice-sheet hydrology. 
              These data will be used to evaluate which modes of subglacial water flow are
              the most important and what values of parameters must be used to best
              incorporate the subglacial processes into the ice sheet model.
