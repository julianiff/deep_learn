This two-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in animal physiological ecology involves Daniel P. Costa of the
              University of California, Santa Cruz, Pierre Jouventin and Henri Weimerskirch
              of the Centre des Etudes Biologiques Cellulaires, Beauvoir-sur-Niort, France,
              and Peter Prince of the British Antarctic Survey.  This NSF grant will
              principally support the participation of a US graduate student in field
              research in the French Antarctic islands in the Southern Ocean.  The objective
              of the research is to investigate foraging and parental investment by wandering
              albatrosses or Diomedea Exulans.  They will test the hypothesis that foraging
              intensity differs between long and short foraging bouts by measuring energy
              expenditure, body composition, and foraging behavior of adults on both types of
              trips. 
 
Using the wandering albatross as a case study, the proposed
              investigations will test current life history theory that long-lived species
              incur few risks during reproduction and maintenance in order to maximize
              fitness over an entire life span.  In essence, adults must differentially
              allocate resources between self-maintenance and reproduction and in some cases,
              this creates conflicts between adults and their offspring or between both
              caregivers.  The US researcher and graduate student bring to this collaboration
              expertise in measurements of foraging and reproductive energetics.  This is
              complemented by French expertise on the biology of albatrosses.  It takes
              advantage of access to permanent stations in French Antarctica, a 30 year
              database on reproductive history and population dynamics of several albatross
              species and French and British advances in ARGOS satellite tagging of
              species.
