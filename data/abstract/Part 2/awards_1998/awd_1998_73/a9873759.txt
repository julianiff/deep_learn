Abstract    :
              This project addresses the scientific challenges of extending telecommunication
              and electronic collaboration to more general "activity at a distance" and into
              physical and social (in contrast to virtual and individual) spaces. There is
              clearly a difference between an in-person visit and a telecommunication
              experience. This project will attempt to understand this difference and to
              reduce it, using and experimenting with robotic technologies called Personal
              Robot Presences (PRoPs): human proxies in real spaces occupied by other people.
              Such a robotic telepresence need not have an anthropomorphic form, but it may
              need a reasonable set of capabilities for interaction. Consequently, this
              project will seek to better understand the social and psychological aspects of
              extended human-human interaction. PRoPs are an excellent platform for studying
              computer- and robot-mediated human interaction because they operate in physical
              and social spaces, and can interact with a group of people. This social context
              sharply underlines the difference between this work and many studies of
              human-machine interactions.  the results of this work are expected to improve
              our understanding of physical and social interactions that are mediated by
              computer and robotic devices in real social and physical space, not simply
              virtual spaces. http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/
