The purpose of this project is to
              develop parallel algorithms to treat a class of multiscale problems associated
              with solid particle dynamics in liquids.  The focus is on full
              three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of the interactions of
              sufficiently large number of particles, thousands of particles, so that
              collective behavior might be inferred.  This builds upon the previous research
              supported under the NSF-HPCC Grand Challenge Group Award where two-dimensional
              simulation had been successfully accomplished.

The particle movers algorithm
              uses a combined weak formulation in which the fluid and particle equations of
              motion are combined into one single equation set in which the interaction
              forces between the particles and fluid cancel, circumventing the need for
              explicit calculation of forces.  Extension to three-dimensions as well as
              increasing the number of particles in order to obtain reliable sample size,
              requires a major overhaul of preconditions and solvers which will define new
              directions for computational fluid mechanics.

The multiscale phenomena
              addressed here are fundamental to the chemical process industry and oil
              exploration and recovery.  Therefore, special considerations will be given to
              present the simulation results into forms which can be understood and used by
              industry.  For example, collaboration with STIM-LAB a group of industrial
              partners in the oil and gas will be strengthened to develop a 3D design
              software package based on the research conducted under NSF support.
