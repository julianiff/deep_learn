Abstract    :
              9873586 Sahinidis Refrigeration technology must eliminate the need for
              chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants (CFCs) and their substitutes if depletion of
              stratospheric ozone and global warming are to be prevented.  The objective of
              this research is to develop a systematic methodology or the design of
              environmentally benign alternative refrigerants.  Towards this goal, the
              researchers plan to (1) develop a mathematical model which selects the atomic
              composition of a refrigerant or refrigerant mixture in such a way that
              environmental and chemical constraints are satisfied while the energy
              efficiency and total warming impact of the refrigerant life-cycles are
              optimized, (2) devise an algorithmic procedure to solve the above model in a
              way that overcomes the combinatorial difficulty of the problem as well as
              difficulties associated with inaccuracies in property prediction estimation
              techniques, (3) establish a computational/experimental system for verifying,
              testing and implementing the theoretical models and algorithmic methods and (4)
              seek experimental verification of the theoretical findings through laboratory
              synthesis and testing of the newly designed compounds.  The research will
              emphasize the interdisciplinary interaction of ideas from atmospheric
              chemistry, process and solution thermodynamics, process and product design and
              operations research (discrete and nonlinear optimization theory).  Preliminary
              results demonstrate that the proposed approach carries a high probability of
              success.  In particular, a novel replacement of Freon 12 has been developed
              that possesses thermodynamic properties that render it more efficient than
              Freon 12 in the context of a typical refrigeration cycle.  This grant is made
              pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research
              Fellowships Program 1998. ***
