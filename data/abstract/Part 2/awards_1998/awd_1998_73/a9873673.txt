Despite the importance of water in arid and semi-arid
              environments and the numerous amount of work centered around competition and
              resource gradients, no studies have been made to separate out the effects of
              root and shoot competition along a soil water gradient. This information is
              critical if we are going to understand the ecology of wood seedlings
              establishment in grassland communities.  This research will examine the
              establishment of woody seedlings in arid and semi-arid environments. A large
              multi-factor field experiment will be undertaken at the Cedar Creek LTER site
              in which water input, nitrogen input and competition from grasses will be
              manipulated. This experiment will permit the quantification of root, shoot and
              whole plant competition by grasses along the water-nitrogen gradient. It will
              also allow an independent quantification of root and shoot competition
              intensity between the tree seedlings (Quercus macrocarpa and Q. ellipsoidalis)
              in each of the above combinations. This research should provide important new
              information on the effect of resource supply on competitive interactions
              between grasses and trees. Although implemented at a single site, the research
              should have broad implications for competition theory as it relates to water
              and nutrients and for predicting plant response to natural and human-caused
              disturbance. Findings from this proposed research should help in understanding
              how global and regional changes in the environment involving increased levels
              of nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation, and replacement of native by
              exotic grasses my be affecting woody seedling establishment in grassland
              communities.
