The Department of Earth and Atmosphric Sciences at
              Metropolitan State College of Denver requests matching funds from the National
              Science Foundation (NSF)  Unidata Equipment Grant program.  The funds will be
              used by the Meteorology Program to purchase new weather data receiving and
              display computers to support the educational objectives of the Program and to
              increase participation in the NSF-sponsored Unidata Program.

The Meteorology
              Program is an active member of Unidata and has not proviously submitted a
              proposal under the Unidata Equipment Grant program.  Its current
              Unidata-related computing equipment will soon be obsolete and unable to meet
              the requirements of the curriculum or educational projects the Program wishes
              to pursue.
