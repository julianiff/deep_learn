High-pressure experiments have provided us with basic knowledge of
              mantle mineralogy. While many mineralogical models of the mantle have been
              developed by comparing the high-pressure experimental results in relatively
              simplified systems, such as the system MgO-FeO-SiO2, with the observed seismic
              data, detailed models require accurately measured physical properties of mantle
              minerals and phase equilibrium data in systems relevant to mantle compositions
              including components such as Al2O3, Fe2O3, and CaO. The aim of this proposal is
              to understand the role of Al2O3, Fe2O3, and CaO in the Earth's lower mantle.
              Specifically, this research is designed  (1) to determine the crystal
              structures of Al- and Al-Ca-rich phases formed in natural basaltic composition
              under lower mantle conditions, (2) to understand the role of Al3+ and Fe3+
              substitutions in the (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskite structure, and (3) to determine the
              effect of Al3+ and Fe3+ substitutions on equations-of-state of
              (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskite. The results from this proposal will be used to
              determine the density of subducted basaltic crust at lower mantle pressures and
              therefore to understand the fate of the subducted basaltic crust in the mantle
              and associated mantle dynamics. The results will provide further understanding
              of the crystal chemistry of Al3+ and Fe3+-bearing (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskites and
              the chemistry of the lower mantle
