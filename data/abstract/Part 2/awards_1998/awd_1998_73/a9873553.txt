Abstract    :
              9873553 Abraham Many commercial chemical syntheses are carried out in organic
              liquid solvents using homogeneous catalysts.  The large-scale use of organic
              solvents has been questioned with respect to long-term environmental impacts. 
              The objective of this research is to explore the use of supercritical carbon
              dioxide as an environmentally benign reaction solvent, and in particular, its
              use for the hydroformylation of propylene.  The use of CO2 as a reaction
              solvent offers optimal environmental performance because CO2 does not deplete
              the ozone layer, does not contribute to ground level smog and will not
              contribute to global warming. Because of solubility limitations, it is unlikely
              that current homogeneous catalysts can be made sufficiently soluble to be
              effective in CO2.  The use of a heterogeneous catalysis is proposed and that
              will also simplify the downstream operations by eliminating the catalysis
              recovery step and allowing the reaction to be performed in a simple packed bed
              reactor.  In order to demonstrate that hydroformylation of polypropylene can be
              accomplished in supercritical CO2 and that a process based on this technology
              is environmentally superior and economically competitive with current
              technology, the researcher will (1) prepare selected heterogeneous catalysts
              that have successfully been used for vapor phase hydroformylation and test
              these catalysts for their activity in supercritical carbon dioxide and (2)
              determine the impact of CO2 on the reaction mechanism and its role in
              controlling the product selectivity and the rate of propylene conversion.  This
              grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology
              Research Fellowships Program 1998.
