KDI: 
              Automated Learning in Network Traffic Control

This is a design and
              implementation study of automated intelligent agents suitable for controlling
              and optimizing resource allocation in large-scale networks.  This area is
              characterized by sparsely-connected, computational elements that interact
              solely through the use of joint resources in massively-distributed
              environments.  The mathematical underpinnings of this research program are
              found in economics.  In contrast to classical theory, however, the underlying
              computational model of strategy selection here involves inductive learning and
              discovery processes.  The here goal is to provide a rigorous treatment of the
              reasoning behavior of automated agents by using belief-revision logics to model
              belief-based learning.  The long term significance of the proposed research is
              the dissemination of automated agents suitable for control and optimization in
              large-scale, geographically distributed networks, without the benefit of common
              knowledge of the state of the system.
