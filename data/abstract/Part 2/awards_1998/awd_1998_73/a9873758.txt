Coastal Carolina University (CCU) has been selected as one of
              ten recipients of the National Science Foundation's Awards for the Integration
              of Research and Education.   CCU became independent of the University of South
              Carolina System in 1994, but remains a state-assisted university with its own
              Board of Trustees.  In its short history, CCU has established an outstanding
              record of faculty and student research with campus-wide emphasis on
              inquiry-based learning focused on undergraduate research programs.  The
              institution has been successful in developing an educational framework
              promoting the integration of research and education for all students.  The
              institution draws on its outreach to local schools to include university
              students and faculty working with in-service teachers and K-12 students. 
              

The University is being awarded $500,000 to advance institutional goals of
              integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its
              exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by
              conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  CCU is at a unique
              juncture in its evolution and is well positioned to experience an effective
              augmentation to the variety of efforts underway in the integration of research
              and education.  To enhance the culture of inquiry, CCU will increase research
              efforts by faculty and students, assimilate integration into teaching-training
              programs for public school teachers who seek to enhance the discovery
              experience for their students, and develop interdisciplinary courses taught by
              faculty teams.
