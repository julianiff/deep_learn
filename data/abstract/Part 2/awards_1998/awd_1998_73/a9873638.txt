This activity will continue a study of the scaling laws
              relating organism size to such key parameters as metabolic rate.  It will use a
              new model that examines the scaling of the hydrodynamic transport of essential
              materials through the network found in each organism.  More general models will
              be considered, as well as possible extensions to other systems.
