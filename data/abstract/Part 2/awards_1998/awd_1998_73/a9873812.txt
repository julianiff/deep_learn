Occidental College has been selected as one of ten
              recipients of the National Science Foundation's Awards for the Integration of
              Research and Education.  Occidental is dedicated to becoming a national model
              that represents a multicultural liberal arts college. The College has developed
              and implemented successful activities that incorporate research into the
              educational experience for a diverse student body in an urban setting. 
              Interdisciplinary models first pioneered in the sciences are being transferred
              across the curriculum and ideas about using new technology for research are
              infused into science from other areas of the curriculum.  

The institution
              views research as an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the many
              facets comprising an academic discipline.  In research the student's emphasis
              shifts beyond knowing factors to constructing their understanding by critical
              thinking, effective writing, presentation of material, and discovery of new
              conceptual relations in collaboration with their mentors.  Providing these
              outcomes for all students in all disciplines is a long-term goal.

Occidental
              College is being awarded  $500,000 to advance institutional goals of
              integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its
              exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by
              conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  An example of the
              College's efforts to expand the educational activities across institutional
              boundaries is the incorporation of models derived from the research activities
              to the K-12 schools in the Los Angeles area.  An 85-foot oceanographic research
              vessel, the RV Vantuna, represents an example of a unique activity that
              integrates research and education.  The Vantuna provides an excellent
              opportunity to involve Occidental and Southern California high school and
              community college students in interdisciplinary marine research.
