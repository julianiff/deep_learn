Abstract    :
              George Schatz is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to develop and apply new theoretical methods for determining quantum
              state-resolved information about chemical reactions.  This research emphasizes
              four areas, including bimolecular reactions of vibrationally excited polyatomic
              molecules, electronically nonadiabatic reactions, vector properties associated
              with reactions, and bimolecular systems involving more than four atoms.  The
              chosen applications are selected because of their importance to current
              experiments in atmospheric chemistry and combustion modeling.

For certain
              kinds of chemical reactions, the combination of theory with computation can
              determine rate constants at an accuracy competitive with experiment.  One such
              class consists of gas-phase bimolecular reactions relevant to combustion and
              atmospheric chemistry.  The ability to model the macroscopic evolution of such
              complex reacting systems is crucially dependent on rate information for
              hundreds of elementary steps, including those not amenable to experiment. 
              Theoretical methods can determine the potential energy surfaces and associated
              dynamics of these reactions, as well as assist in the modeling of many
              molecular beam and laser chemistry experiments.
