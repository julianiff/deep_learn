Abstract    :
              Robert Parsons is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to theoretically investigate complex dynamics in cluster ions.  He uses
              clusters to discover the microscopic details of solvation, electron transfer,
              and energy dissipation that distinguish reactions in the condensed phase from
              their gas-phase analogs.  Projects include molecular dynamics simulations of
              iodine anion photodissociation in carbonyl sulfide clusters, a more rigorous
              treatment of simulated time-resolved photoelectron spectra, and development of
              a kinetic theory of vibrational relaxation incorporating solvent
              evaporation.

Molecular ions in the gas-phase can become solvated by
              surrounding neutral molecules in much the same way as ions become solvated by
              water in aqueous solutions.  This research establishes connections to condensed
              phase phenomena by increasing our understanding of cluster dynamics.  In
              particular, the role of strong and long-ranged solute-solvent interactions has
              not heretofore been investigated in detail.  Parson's use of hierarchical
              models is particularly valuable in delineating the possible limitations of
              simpler descriptions of these phenomena.
