Harvey Mudd College has been selected as one of ten
              recipients of the National Science Foundation's Awards for the Integration of
              Research and Education.  Since its founding, the College has provided a rich
              academic environment for integrating research and education.  The Engineering
              Clinic, a program focusing on teams of students practicing their profession by
              working on "real problems for real clients", has been extended to other
              scientific disciplines.  Each Harvey Mudd student is required to have a
              capstone senior experience in the form of a clinic project or a research
              thesis, and every curriculum includes a broad technical core that provides
              tools and knowledge for interdisciplinary research.

The College is being
              awarded $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and
              education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities,
              and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach
              activities over the coming three years.  By establishing integrated first-year,
              project-oriented laboratory courses, expanding the colloquia program, and
              creating interdisciplinary and peer mentoring summer projects, a successful
              program will be strengthened.  In addition, funds will be used to develop
              workshops for area K-12 science teachers, create an assessment program to
              evaluate the institution's efforts in integrating research and education, and
              create new summer research opportunities for minority students from the first
              year class.  An interesting component to the College's outreach efforts is
              "FutureWatch", a half-hour weekly radio and cable television broadcast
              exploring issues of science, technology, and the environment, an excellent
              vehicle used to inform the public.  An expanded format will include programs in
              which Harvey Mudd faculty and students discuss their own research activities,
              and the institution's efforts to perform integration activities.
