Monazite grains in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks
              often contain multiple growth zones that yield U,Th-Pb dates corresponding to
              multiple events in the history of a rock.  The proposed lab and field
              experiments are designed to characterize monazite growth and recrystallization.
               In-situ measurements of textural features, ages, and compositions of growth
              zones in natural monazites collected from regions with well-characterized
              histories (a pluton in southern Nevada, metamorphic terranes in North Carolina
              and California) will help to establish the timing and conditions of monazite
              growth.  Lab experiments conducted undersimilar conditions will quantify growth
              mechanisms and rates and corroborate textural interpretations of zoning in
              natural monazites.  Because growth and recrystallization often appears to be
              related to fluid influx, experiments on rocks containing monazite and fluid
              will help to identify characteristic textural features of hydrothermal growth
              and recrystallization including crystal size distributions, zoning patterns,
              inclusion/host relations, and wetting angles.  The dependence of these features
              on fluid composition, host grain size and coarsening rate, and temperature will
              also be investigated to identify conditions of growth of natural monazites.  
              Results will refine interpretations of texture and zoning in natural monazites
              and the correlation of measured U,Th-Pb monazite ages with specific geochemical
              and tectonic events.
