The amount of carbon dioxide available for plant growth
              varies substantially among aquatic ecosystems.  Submersed aquatic macrophytes
              differ in the forms of CO2 that they are able to use.  Different species are
              differentially sensitive to different carbon levels.  It is hypothesized that
              differences in CO2 availability will be related to the types of plant species
              that occur in acid and circumneutral lakes because of species' differential
              sensitivities to carbon levels.  Differential sensitivity to CO2 levels is
              expected to explain many of the among-lake differences that are observed in
              macrophyte community composition.  To test this, growth sensitivity to CO2 will
              be tested for most submersed plant species in lakes in the Adirondack Mountains
              in NY.  Lakes in this regions exhibit a wide range of chemical conditions and
              CO2 levels.  Plant responses will be tested in controlled greenhouse tank
              experiments to determine a CO2 sensitivity index (CSI) for each species.  These
              indices will be combined with information to be collected on the distribution
              of submersed macrophytes across a range of lakes.  Information on these lakes'
              chemical conditions will also be determined to test for relationships between
              the CSI and lake environmental conditions.  In addition, artificial communities
              will be established with 6 species with varying  CSI's to test the macrophyte
              distribution hypothesis experimentally.  This work, combining lab, greenhouse,
              and in situ experiments with surveys of natural habitats will provide a
              thorough assessment of the importance of differential CO2 exposure to natural
              community composition.
