Abstract    :
              9873724 Duvall The monocots constitute a well-defined group of 50,000 plant
              species that have undoubtedly evolved from a single ancestor.  However,
              botanists are still
unsure of the most closely related dicot, the so-called
              sister group of the monocots.  Although the basal group of monocots is now
              known to be the Acoranan lineage, details regarding ancestral characters of the
              group are still uncertain.

The monocots are known to be part of a greater
              evolutionary radiation of ancient herbaceous species, the paleoherbs. 
              Relationships within over fifty species of paleoherbs will be explored using
              key floral characters and genes from the three plant genomes, the chloroplast,
              the nucleus, and the mitochondrion.  Approximately 6000 base pairs of
              nucleotide sequence will be determined for each species.  These data will be
              used to study phylogenetic patterns within paleoherbs and to identify the dicot
              sister group to the
monocots.

A strongly supported phylogenetic hypothesis
              for the dicot sister group to the monocots will be a significant contribution
              to our understanding of the molecular evolution and systematics of the
              paleoherbs and provide systematists with an appropriate reference group for
              further evolutionary studies.  Once the phylogenetic questions have been
              answered, organismal characteristics in the relevant sister group taxon can be
              identified to determine which characters were critical to the adaptive
              radiation of this large group.  Molecular investigation of these characters may
              identify key genes important to the fundamental monocot morphology.  Finally,
              new and better supported hypotheses for the origin and radiation of monocots
              will be formulated.
