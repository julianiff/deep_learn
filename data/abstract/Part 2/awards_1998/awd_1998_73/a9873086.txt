The purpose of this award is to investigate the computational
              problems in sensing and control of a prototypical metropolitan area freeway
              transportation system, comprising a 1,000 lane mile network spread ver 100
              square miles, used daily by 1,000,000 people in 500,000 vehicles.  Technical
              challenges in sensing, state estimation, prediction, control and incident
              detection are addressed.  Sensing requires real-time processing and fusing of
              data from loops, video cameras, probe vehicles, and cellular phones. 
              Estimation of system state parameters (e.g. travel time distributions over
              numerous links) requires combining current sensor data, data from the immediate
              past, as well as historical data while maintaining spatial continuity
              constraints.  Multiple scale models that can predict the evolution of system
              state over time and space will be developed and used to calculate real-time
              control actions for the available "actuators" (variable messages signs, ramp
              meters, signals) in order to improve performance.  Based on learned
              characteristic signatures, the same models can be used to detect and classify
              incidents such as injury accidents with sufficient reliability to trigger
              appropriate responses.

The impact of this research will be to develop the
              core capabilities of a traffic management information system for the
              twenty-first century.  While the current system is monitored by a variety of
              sensors and vast resources are dispatched to prevent system breakdown, in the
              absence of computational technology to estimate system state and to predict
              system behavior, both transportation managers and travelers make decisions as
              if they were blind-folded.  Systems based on this research potentially offer
              huge benefits to both traffic managers and travelers.  For traffic managers,
              they will provide a real-time overview of system performance and a quantitative
              analysis of the impact of various control options.  For travelers, they can
              provide real-time information and advice during the planning and execution of
              their trips.  The techniques developed in the project also potentially have
              application to other problems, such as air traffic control, which share many of
              its essential characteristics.
