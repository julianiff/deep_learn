Abstract    :
              9802264  Moore  this award will support a seismic reflection, refraction and 
              passive seismicity program to study underthrusting of oceanic crust  along the
              Nankai Trough off the east coast of Japan. The primary  feature to be examined
              in this experiment is the subduction thrust  fault from its aseismic zone in
              the Trough (trench) to a depth of  at least 15 kilometers beneath the
              continental margin where the  thrust is marked by significant seismic activity.
              The goal of the  study is to examine changes in physical properties along the
              thrust  as it changes from aseismic to seismic expression. Understanding  this
              transition from compaction and aseismic slip to brittle  failure is a major
              unknown in understanding lithospheric  consumption and earthquake dynamics.
              This Nankai seismogenic zone  marks the location of major destructive
              earthquakes along the  Japanese margin. The project is a collaborative
              experiment. United  State scientists will be responsible for acquiring and
              interpreting  3-dimensional seismic reflection data from the thrust fault and 
              accreting margin. Japanese colleagues will be responsible for  deploying ocean
              bottom seismometers for seismic refraction and  passive seismicity studies. In
              addition t the basic scientific  interpretation to be derived from the data,
              the experiment is  critical to the development of the MARGINS initiative and
              will  provide necessary site location data for future drilling by the 
              international Ocean Drilling Program.  ***
