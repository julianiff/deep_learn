The COSMO series of conferences cover work at the
              boundaries of particle physics and of cosmology.  This is an exciting field in
              which many recent discoveries have been made-including the new result
              indicating that neutrinos have mass.  This conference will be attended by
              scientists from all over the world and this grant will enable several students
              to participate in the meeting.
