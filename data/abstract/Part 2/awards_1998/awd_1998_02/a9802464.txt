Stochastic Control Models in
              Finance

Abstract:

Research is proposed in five areas.  These are unified
              by a stochastic
calculus methodology.
(1) Callable convertible bonds.  This
              is a two-person game, played by a
bond-holder, who can convert the bond for
              stock, and the issuing firm,
which can call the bond and thereby force
              conversion or surrender.
(2) Contingent claim replication under portfolio
              constraints.  A
financial institution takes a position in assets which produce
              a risky
cash flow, and wishes to offset this risk by taking opposing
              positions. 
However, there may be constraints on its actions, or the
              offsetting
positions mandated by the model employed may be too unstable to
              actually
implement.  The effect of such constraints can be studied via a
              dual
problem.
(3) Passport options.  A passport option entitles its owner to
              actively
manage a fund, receive any profit which accrues, and be forgiven
              any
loss which occurs.  The institution selling this option must observe
              the
trading activity of the option owner and solve a stochastic
              control
problem to determine how to react to the owner's trading so as to
              be
able to cover losses the owner incurs.
(4) Credit derivatives. Financial
              institutions sell a variety of
contracts designed to pay off in the event of
              default of corporate
bonds.  Default cannot be perfectly predicted, and this
              element of
'surprise' requires that models reach beyond the
              standard
Brownian-motion framework. 
(5) Energy derivatives.  Deregulation of
              natural gas and electricity has
given impetus to derivative securities in
              energy markets, and models for
such derivatives are under development.

The
              United States has a tenuous lead in the financial services industry
in large
              part because of the whole-scale integration of mathematical
modelling and
              computer technology into this industry.  The maintenance
of this lead requires
              continued fundamental research and redoubled
technological educational
              efforts.  This proposal is part of a long-term
project to develop an
              educational and research enterprise which is
doubly connected to the finance
              industry.  The first connection is
through the provision of human resources. 
              The proposed work would
support a successful interdisciplinary Ph.D. program
              in Mathematical
Finance.  Carnegie Mellon also has a professional Master's
              degree
program in Computational Finance, and an undergraduate option in
              finance
is under development.  These programs have a substantial synergy. 
              The
second connection with industry is through research projects which
              use
advanced mathematics on fundamental problems drawn from the
              industrial
context.  Among these are energy derivatives, which have
              become
important with the deregulation of natural gas an electricity,
              and
credit derivatives, which are a form of insurance against default
              of
corporate bonds
