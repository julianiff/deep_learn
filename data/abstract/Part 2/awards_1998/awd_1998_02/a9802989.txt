Abstract    :
              Anthony C.S. Readhead  Timothy J. Pearson  Steven Padin  California Institute of

              Observations with the Cosmic Background Imager.    The cosmic microwave
              background radiation (CMBR) is the relic radiation left over from the Big Bang
              with which the Universe began 15 billion years ago.  Emitted just 300,000 years
              after the Big Bang, this radiation is the most ancient direct signal that we
              receive from the early Universe.  It is believed that the important
              cosmological parameters - including the density parameter, the Hubble constant,
              and the cosmological constant - all left signatures on the CMBR and can be
              determined from sufficiently sensitive observations.  In addition, the CMBR
              must contain clues to the origin of all structure in the Universe - from
              superclusters and clusters of galaxies down to galaxies themselves, and hence
              to stars and planets.    The Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) is an instrument
              designed to make images of the CMBR and to measure its statistical properties
              on angular scales from 5 arc minutes to one degree (spherical harmonic scales
              from   l = 3000 down to l = 300).  Theoretical models suggest that these
              observations can be used to measure the fundamental cosmological parameters
              with some precision.  The CBI is a 13-element interferometer mounted on a
              6.5-meter platform operating in ten 1-GHz frequency bands from 26 GHz to 36
              GHz.  The CBI will be installed in Chile at an altitude of 5000 meters.  A
              high, dry site is essential in order to reach the required sensitivity levels
              in a reasonable observing time.  The instrument will be operated at the Chile
              site continuously over a 2 to 2.5 year period.
