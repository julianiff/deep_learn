Abstract    :
              Fairbanks    Funds under the SGER program are provided to study the  chemistry
              of the  upper ocean in the tropical Pacific during the 1997 ENSO  event.  The
              funds will  be used to complement a funded offshore coral drilling  expedition
              on the R/V  Moana Wave. Underway hydrographic data as well as more  complete
              chemical  and isotopic data from the upper ocean at profiles will be  collected
              in the Nino 3  region on a cross-equatorial transect from Hawaii and  Christmas
              island, at  stations spacings of one degree latitude or less. The  proposed
              nutrient, oxygen  and fluorescence measurements that are proposed will form a 
              base-line for  comparison to prior and future studies of the changes in  upper
              ocean  geochemistry during El Nino and non-El Nino events. The  oxygen isotope 
              collection will improve our understanding of the convective  system , its 
              associated fresh water pathways  and its impacts on the  temperature and
              salinity  stratification of the upper ocean. These processes are  thought to be
              one of the  sources of model failures in the some of the predictive ENSO 
              models.
