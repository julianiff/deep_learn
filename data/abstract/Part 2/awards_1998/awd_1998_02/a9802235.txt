The aim of this project is to study Serre's Positivity
              
Conjecture for intersection multiplicities.  This conjecture
concerns the
              intersection multiplicity of two finitely 
generated modules over a regular
              local ring which have the 
property  that their supports  intersect only at 
              the maximal 
ideal of the ring. It states that the multiplicity is positive
              
if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the supports is equal 
to the
              dimension of the ring.   Recently new developments in
the theory of resolution
              of singularities in mixed characteristic 
have led  to a new approach to this
              problem, and these ideas have been 
used to show that intersection
              multiplicities are always 
nonnegative.  This proposal outlines an approach to
              
the positivity conjecture using these methods.


The question of how to
              define intersection multiplicities in 
a satisfactory way has been an
              important topic in Commutative 
Algebra for many years. The basic idea is to 
              measure of the extent
two which two subspaces of a space  are tangent to each
              other, and the
definition should satisfy various conditions to ensure that
              it
agrees with usual definitions in simple cases and that it can
be used in
              computations.  A little over thirty years ago Serre 
proposed an algebraic
              definition  which satisfied many of the 
required properties but which
              involved negative terms.  There
were several questions left open concerning 
              when the intersection
multiplicities are zero (vanishing), whether they are
              always 
greater than or equal to zero (nonnegativity), and the 
precise
              conditions for them to be strictly greater than zero 
(positivity).  Since
              then the vanishing and, more recently, the 
nonnegativity conjectures have
              been proven. This proposal
concerns a study of  the positivity conjecture
              using new methods
from Algebraic Geometry.
