Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9802496                                  Principal
              Investigator: Mark Kuzyk    Title: International Conference on Organic
              Nonlinear Optics IV          Abstract    This is a proposal requesting support
              of $6,600 for International Conference on Organic Nonolinear Optics IV to be
              held in Hokkaido, Japan.    The symposium will provide a foum for discussion of
              recent development in studies of nonlinear optical processes in organic and
              polymeric system and their applications in photonic technologies. This
              symposium is the fourth in a series that has been supported by NSF  previously.
              The funds granted to support this conference will be used for travel of
              graduate students with highest priority given to students who are presenting
              papers at the conference as first authors. This is appropriate utilization of
              NSF funds, since the experience obtained in attending conferences are often
              invaluable to the graduate students in educational terms, in establishing
              professional contacts and in job searching.    I recommend  an award to be made
              for the sum of $3,000 for this conference. The PI has accepted the reduced
              amount of support from his original request.
