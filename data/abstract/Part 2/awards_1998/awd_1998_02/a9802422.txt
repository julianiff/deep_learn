Abstract    :
              Yasbin  9802422  Support is provided for the 42nd, 43rd, and 44th annual
              meetings of the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology, to be held at the
              Aspen Lodge, Estes Park, Colorado.  The 42nd meeting will be held on June 3-7,
              1998.  The dates for the other two years will not be determined until 12 months
              prior to the meetings.  This conference is primarily concerned with the biology
              of prokaryotes, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this
              subject area.  One significant feature of thes meetings is their accessibility
              to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently
              are limited.  Specifically to address this problem, funds are being used to
              provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of
              graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas that
              comprise prokaryotic biology.
