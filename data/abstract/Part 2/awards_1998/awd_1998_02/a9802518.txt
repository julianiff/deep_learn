Abstract    :
              9802518  Poirier    This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research
               project between Drs. David R. Poirier and Juan C. Heinrich,  of the University
              of Arizona, and Drs. S. Felicelli and E.  Basombrio, Centro Atomico Bariloche,
              Argentina, on the  modeling and simulation of solidification in alloy castings.
               The major objective in the research is to produce porosity-  free structural
              castings in order to avoid the formation of  defects which usually result in
              directional solidification  processes.  The researchers aim to develop
              simulators for  complex three-dimensional shapes suitable  for  studying  the
              formation of casting defects .    This collaboration will complement two
              programs of the  University of Arizona, which model the formation of  porosity.
               The investigators at Centro Atomico Bariloche,  with their  experience in
              numerical modeling of the moving  interfaces, will add an important component
              to these  programs.  Together, both groups will also continue to  refine a
              preliminary model on pore nucleation.  Several  graduate students from both the
              University of Arizona and  Centro Atomico Bariloche will be involved in the
              research,  either in the development of new models and their computer 
              programs, or in the use of the simulators in conjunction  with experimental
              work.    ***
