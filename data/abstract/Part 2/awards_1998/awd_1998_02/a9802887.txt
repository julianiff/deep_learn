Abstract    :
              9802887  Muhunthan      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
               U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Balasingam Muhunthan of Washington  State
              University to work with Dr. Malcolm Bolton at  Cambridge University on the
              effects of microstructure on  mechanical and transport processes in soils. 
              Funding for  this award comes from the Hazard Reduction Program in the 
              Division of Engineering.  This collaboration will develop a  new framework to
              enable the characterization of nonlinear  and unstable materials behavior from
              the approach of micro-mechanics.    Dr. Bolton has made significant
              contributions in  constitutive modeling of soils and centrifuge testing for 
              geotechnical applications.  He is director of the Cambridge  Geotechnical
              Centrifuge Center.  ***
