This U.S.-Mexico award will support cooperative research
              between Drs. James M. Lattimer and Madappa Prakash of the State University of
              New York at Stony Brook and Dr. Dany Page of the Universidad National Autonoma
              de Mexico at the Instituto de Astronomia.  The collaborators plan to use
              multi-wavelength observations of neutron stars to improve our understanding of
              their structure and thermal history.  More specifically, they will  extract
              surface temperature readings from photon observations through atmospheric
              modeling, obtain detailed simulations of thermal evolution and new calculations
              of superfluidity, investigate neutrino emissivities in dense matter, and
              conduct studies of crustal properties of neutron stars.
The researchers from
              Mexico will bring theoretical expertise on neutron star cooling and structure
              while the scientists from SUNY will contribute their experience in neutrino
              processes in dense matter and the physics of neutron stars.
