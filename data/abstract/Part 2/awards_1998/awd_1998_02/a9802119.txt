Abstract    :
              Jeremy Tasch  Clark University    The doctoral dissertation research proposal
              focuses upon the main question of how decentralization affects resource
              development in the Russian Far East.  The work will examine whether
              privatization and decentralization processes inadvertently perpetuate
              Soviet-like production priorities, even as local and regional stakeholders'
              control over local natural resources is expanded. A major question to be
              answered is the extent to which compliance with environmental regulations is
              being incorporated into industrial privatization and whether market driven
              conditions are replacing Soviet production quotas as justification for
              environmental degradation.  This work is important to further understanding
              resource development and management under conditions of decentralization,
              restructuring and democratization.
