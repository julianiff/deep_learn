Abstract    :
              William Merline

 Ground-Based Search for Asteroidal Satellites Using Adaptive
              Optics.

Dr. William Merline and colleagues from the Southwest Research
              Institute will conduct a search for satellites of asteroids using adaptive
              optics systems at Mt. Wilson in California and the Canada-France-Hawaii
              Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The sample will include ~200 asteroids over
              three years.  Any positive result will yield a mass of the detected system,
              thus its density and powerful constraints on its mineralogy, meteorite
              association, and chemical and physical history.  The research will strongly
              condition theories about delivery of material into the inner Solar System.
