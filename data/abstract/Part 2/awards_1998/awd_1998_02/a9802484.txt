A broad program of research centered on the foundations of
              string and quantum field theory is proposed.  Much of the effort is devoted to
              the nonperturbative dynamics of strings and the applications of these advances
              to quantum gravity, black hole entropy and information loss problems.  A second
              focus is to increase understanding of nonabelian gauge theory in order to
              examine physics beyond the standard model.  Finally, research will be carried
              out using the tools of conformal field theory to problems in turbulence.
