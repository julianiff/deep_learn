Abstract    :
              9802803  Boninsegni  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
              Award  for a theoretical program consisting of numerical studies of  Helium
              physisorption.  Computer simulations of Helium  adsorbed on alkali surfaces and
              on graphite will be  performed using the Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC)
              method.  Available, realistic interatomic potentials will be adopted  to model
              the interaction among Helium atoms, as well as  between Helium atoms and the
              substrate.    Specific objectives of the proposed research effort will be  the
              study of the physical properties of a 4He adsorbate on  the surface of alkali
              metals, as well as on a graphite  substrate.  The unifying theme of this
              research is the topic  of physisorption, of great interest in condensed matter 
              physics, and one where relatively little numerical  simulation has been
              performed so far.  This research is also  expected to offer novel insight into
              such fundamental  theoretical issues as phase transitions in reduced 
              dimensions and monolayer superfluidity.    The PIMC method is arguably the most
              powerful numerical tool  currently available to calculate thermodynamic
              properties of  quantum many-body systems directly from a microscopic 
              Hamiltonian.   The use of this technique in this research  can afford
              quantitative predictions for a variety of  adsorption phenomena involving
              differently attractive  substrates and a quantum adsorbate; thus, it will help
              in  the interpretation of several ongoing experiments involving  Helium
              adsorption.  %%%  This is a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Award 
              to support a program of numerical simulation of the  adsorption of Helium on
              various substrates including  graphite.  The numerical simulations will support
              a number  of experiments being done elsewhere.  The simulations will  also
              provide insight into phase transitions of adsorbates on  surfaces and on
              monolayer superfluidity.  ***
