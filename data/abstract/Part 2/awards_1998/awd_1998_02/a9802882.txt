Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop a new visual exploration paradigm emphasizing
              integrated data/metadata analysis and to use it to enhance the capabilities of
              the DEVise (Data Exploration and VISualization Environment) tool. From a
              research standpoint, several issues require attention in developing such tools,
              including optimization and evaluation techniques to support scalability for
              large datasets, integrated presentation of data and metadata, combination of
              database-style querying and visualization, and support for collaborative
              analysis. This is expected to lead to significantly improved interactive visual
              interfaces to large, distributed databases, with potential applications in a
              wide variety of commercial and scientific domains. The results will be
              published in articles, and embodied in a prototype tool that will be freely
              distributed in binary form.     http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~devise
