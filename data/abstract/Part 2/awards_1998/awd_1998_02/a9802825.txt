Abstract    :
              9802825  McNulty   Subduction of the Nazca plate beneath South America  has
              resulted in generation of the Andean continental magmatic arc, which often
              serves as the type locality of such arcs.  However the interaction between
              plate relative motions, magmatic processes, and deformation are still poorly
              understood.  This project takes advantage of a very young and well-exposed
              batholith in north-central Peru to address a variety of needed parameters such
              as age, depth of emplacement, wall and roof rocks and a marginal shear zone. 
              Results will be integrated with extensive data on the batholith with the intent
              of formulating a general model for batholith emplacement in transtensional arc
              settings.
