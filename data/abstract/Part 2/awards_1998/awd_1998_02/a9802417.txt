Abstract    :
              9802417  Glazier    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
               between Dr. James A. Glazier, University of Notre Dame and  Professor Jose
              Roberto Iglesias, Universidade Federal Do Rio  Grande Do Sol.    The subject of
              this research is to understand complex  pattern formation in tissues and foams.
               Dr. Glazier has  developed an internationally recognized program in the area 
              of cellular patterns.  Professor Iglesias' research group  was the first to
              simulate cell division using the Potts  model and they have made a number of
              contributions to the  theoretical understanding of the structure and evolution
              of  three-dimensional foams.  They propose the study of four  separate topics:
              the theory and experiment on the sorting of  cells into a coherent tissue and
              the evolution of three  dimensional foams in response to gas diffusion and
              drainage.  The proposed research could address an important question in 
              cellular pattern formation and growth that may have  significant applications
              to the fields of biophysics and  developmental biology.  ***
