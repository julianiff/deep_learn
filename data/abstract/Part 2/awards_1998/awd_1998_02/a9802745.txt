Abstract    :
              This project concerns model-theory---a branch of mathematical logic---and its
              interaction with other areas of mathematics, especially algebra and analysis.
              Van den Dries will continue the investigation and construction of o-minimal
              expansions of the real field. He will give special attention to possible
              applications to real analytic geometry and to analytic differential equations.
              In connection with the latter he intends to develop the model theory of Hardy
              fields and of fields of logarithmic-exponential series.    The motivation for
              this proposal is to investigate in great detail certain fundamental
              mathematical structures where the solutions of differential equations
              automatically have a definite asymptotic behavior.  (Differential equations are
              a ubiquitous mathematical tool in the sciences.) The novelty is that this study
              is undertaken from the point of view of model theory, a branch of mathematical
              logic which has made enormous strides in recent years. The techniques of model
              theory have never been applied to such asymptotic questions before, and it will
              be extremely interesting to see what this new perspective will reveal in this
              area of algebraic analysis.
