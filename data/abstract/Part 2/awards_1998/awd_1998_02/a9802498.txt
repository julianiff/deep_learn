Abstract    :
              The investigators continue their work on an alternative radio emission theory,
              involving no Langmuir waves.  Instead, the mechanism relies on the pervasive
              existence of Alfven waves in the interplanetary medium.  Resulting from
              electron interaction with enhanced Alfven waves, the wave-particle resonance
              condition is modified, leading to direct amplification of radiation without
              recourse to Langmuir waves or nonlinear processes.  Specifically, he (1)
              conducts a systematic survey of physical parameters and determines the
              instability characteristic as a function of these parameters; (2) extends the
              stability analysis to electrostatic Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves; (3)
              generalizes his analysis to an obliquely propagating electromagnetic wave; (4)
              fully relativistically generalizes the theory; and (5) obtains information on
              the saturated wave amplitude.
