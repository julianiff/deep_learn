Abstract    :
              9802538  Cromwell    The International Research Fellow Awards Program  enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct  three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month 
              postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Howard Casey  Cromwell to work with Dr.
              Wolfram Schulz at the  Institute of Physiology of the University of  Fribourg
              in Fribourg, Switzerland.    Dr. Cromwell will be learning in vivo 
              electrophysiology techniques in monkeys. This  work focuses on the role of
              basal ganglia in  the processing of rewards.  Reward processing  is an
              important aspect of goal-directed  behavior.  It incorporates sensory
              information  with an individual's physiological state and  associative learning
              history for the  production of appropriate behavioral output.    The host lab
              of Dr. Schultz is one of the few  places doing these recordings from striatum
              in  monkeys.  It may be the only place that  combines this technique with a
              research focus  on emotional and motivational aspects of basal  ganglia
              functioning.  This collaboration with  Dr. Schultz will allow Dr. Cromwell to
              set up  similar recording in the United States.  ***
