Abstract    :
              This project is to observe Electric fields in the vicinity of the Sun.  Electric
              fields in flaring regions on the Sun may give rise to Electric field values of
              near 35V/cm parallel to the magnetic field.  This project will make and utilize
              observations from the NSO Evans Facility at Sac Peak NM and nearby Kitt Peak to
              observe the Sun in an attempt to obatin electric field measurements.  To date,
              no observations of E fields exist, and this study is exciting for this reason.
