Abstract    :
              This research focuses on using combinatorial methods to elucidate the  
              catalytic activity of polyalkylamine polymers with carboxylic acid  
              functionalities.   To elucidate the mechanism by which these poorly  
              characterized heterogeneous systems catalyze ketone reductions,   elimination
              reactions and the Robinson annulation reaction, variables   known to affect
              both the efficiency and the induction period preceding   full catalytic
              activity will be systematically addressed by means of an   automated
              combinatorial protocol.   Synthetically modified precursors   will be used to
              elucidate substrate specificity in the optimized systems.      Graduate
              students involved in the research will be introduced to   combinatorial
              techniques and their application to elucidating and   optimizing heterogeneous
              catalytic activity.     The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the research   and educational activities of Professor Fredric Menger
              of the Department   of Chemistry at Emory University.    Professor Menger will
              use an   automated combinatorial approach to determine and optimize the
              catalytic   activity of polyalkylamine polymers with appended carboxylic acid  
              functionalities.    Professor Menger's educational activities include  
              training graduate students in combinatorial methodology, and the use of   this
              methodology in identifying and optimizing the catalytic activity of   polymer
              substrates with different appended carboxylic acids.
