Abstract    :
              9802672  Sen Gupta      This U. S.-Mexico award will support a short-term visit
              by  Prof. B.K. Sen Gupta and L.C. Anderson of Louisiana State  University to
              Prof. M. Machain Castillo of the Instituto de  Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia of
              the Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The investigators plan to
              design  a joint research program involving the use of the fossil  record of
              certain foraminifers and molluscs as an indicator  of climatic and
              physiographic conditions associated with  tropical seagrass meadows.  For that
              purpose, the  researchers intend to study the distribution and ecology of 
              organisms inhabiting extensive seagrass and adjacent  habitats along the Gulf
              and Caribbean shorelines of Mexico.  The transport and preservation potential
              of these organisms  will also be studied.    The UNAM research team will
              include ecologists,  paleontologists; and oceanographers whose specialties and 
              interests complement those of the LSU team.  A better  understanding of
              seagrass ecology and paleoecology will be  relevant to coastal management
              problems of both countries.    ***
