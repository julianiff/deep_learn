Abstract    :
              The design of application-specific embedded computing  systems is done as
              hardware/software co-design to jointly  optimize the hardware platform and
              software executing on  that platform.  This research is investigating two
              aspects  of the co-analysis of embedded computing systems: memory  systems and
              sensitivity analysis.  The goal is to obtain co-  synthesis analysis methods
              which can guide synthesis  decisions.  Embedded computers have hierarchical
              memory  systems with caching to keep the processors busy.  Since  these systems
              are often real-time, the software must execute  to performance bounds even in
              the presence of caching to  keep the processors busy.  Models for finding
              bounds  on  execution time in the presence of caches, and make effective  use
              of available hardware, are being studied.  Also, co-  synthesis algorithms need
              to analyze the sensitivity of the  system to the characteristics of the
              components.  Sensitivity analysis can tell how much system performance  changes
              as the execution speed of a component changes.  Sensitivity measures, which can
              be used in the inner loop of  co-synthesis to help guide optimization choices,
              are being  explored.  The co-analysis methods are being evaluated in  the
              context of co-synthesis algorithms.
