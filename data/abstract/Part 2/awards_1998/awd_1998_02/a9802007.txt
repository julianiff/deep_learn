Coronas and Escape from
              the Martian Atmosphere, Ancient and Modern


The evolution of the Martian
              atmosphere is influenced by a number of processes, including outgassing from
              the planetary interior, impacts of comets and meteors, atmosphere-surface
              interactions, and by escape of volatiles to space.  A quantification of the
              processes by which volatiles are lost irreversibly to space is crucial to a
              reconstruction of the evolution of the Martian environment.  Dr. Jane Fox and
              her colleagues will model the photochemical and sputtering escape fluxes of
              oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen simultaneously as a function of time from the
              present to the end of late heavy bombardment, about 3.8 billion years ago. 
              This will allow the investigators to predict the history of nitrogen, water,
              and carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere.
