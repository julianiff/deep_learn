Abstract    :
              9802686  Matano    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a planning visit between 
              Dr. Ricardo P. Matano, Oregon State University, Dr. E.  Chassignet, University
              of Miami, and Dr. Edmo J. Campos of  the University of Sao Paulo, who wish to
              do a numerical  study of the North Brazil Current.    The North Brazil Current
              (NBC) plays a role in the inter  hemispheric exchanges of mass and heat by
              providing the  cross-equatorial transport of upper ocean waters to the 
              Atlantic overturning cell.  The causes of the current  variability and its
              effects on the inter-hemispheric  exchange are poorly known.  Dr. Campos is
              involved in a  project entitled, "Rings of the North Brazil Current" which  is
              funded by NSF, to observe this.  This planning visit will  allow Drs. Matano
              and Chassignet to consult with Dr. Campos  on his portion of the larger
              project, his responsibiity  being the modeling component.  These American
              researchers  are experts in to general circulation models, the Miami  Isopycnic
              Coordinate Ocean Model and the Princeton Ocean  Model.  The three researchers
              wish to develop a research  collaboration which will continue the search for 
              understanding of this phenomenon.    ***
