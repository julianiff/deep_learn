This Coalition of 7 universities:  University of Alabama;
              Arizona State University; rose-Hulman Institute of Technology; Texas A&M
              University; College Station; Texas A&M University, Kingsville; University of
              Massachusetts, Dartmouth; and University of Wisconsin-Madison, together with 7
              affiliated institutions:  Maricopa Community College District; Texas Woman's
              University; University of Pittsburgh; University of Texas at El Paso; South
              Dakota Schools of Mines and Technology; Instituto Technologico y de Estudios
              Superiores de Monterrey (Mexico); and Universidade Federal de Sant Catarina
              (Brazil) have been awarded a 5 year renewal of their award to complete their
              activities to change the practice and culture of undergraduate engineering
              education.  While the affiliates participate in the work of the Coalition, they
              are not supported in this by any Federal funds.

The Foundation Engineering
              Education Coalition's vision is to be a recognized leader in creating a new
              engineering education culture that is responsive to technological changes and
              societal needs.

To build on their work to date, the Coalition will develop
              further its engineering education innovations and work to have these
              institutionalized on the campuses of their members and affiliates.  They will
              also participate in a multi-coalition effort to disseminate the product and
              practices of this and the other engineering education coalitions, to the
              engineering education community at large.

Details of the work of this and
              other Engineering Education Coalitions are available on the World Wide Web at
              http://www.needs.org/coalitions/.  Information on the Foundation Coalition can
              also be found at http://foundation.ua.edu/.
