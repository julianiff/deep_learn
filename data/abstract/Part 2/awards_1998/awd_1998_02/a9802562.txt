Abstract    :
              9802562  Marder    This project will study the dyanamics of cracks in brittle 
              materials, using single crystal silicon since it is the best  characterized
              material available, and single crystals of high  quality are plentiful and
              relatively inexpensive.  The PIs have  developed a set of experimental tools
              that improve significantly  the measurement of cracks in motion.  Using these
              tools they will  gather data that characterize brittle fracture of silicon, and
               show how it is influenced by atomic structure.  These tools are  1) a dynamic
              potential drop method which makes it possible to  measure the velocity and
              location of a crack 120, 000 times in  succession at intervals of one twentieth
              of a microsecond and  with accuracy of plus or minus10 meters per second; 2) a
              loading  apparatus capable of applying rigid displacements to a 10 cm long 
              sample with accuracy of 0.1 micron; and 3) X-ray topography to  obtain images
              of subsurface conditions, before and after  fracture.  The research will
              measure how the speed of a rapidly  running crack in single-crystal silicon
              depends upon loading  magnitude, loading mode, crystal plane, orientation, and 
              temperature.  The structures left behind the cracks, both on and  below the
              fracture surface, will also be measured.  %%%  With a detailed understanding of
              how running cracks respond to  external and atomic-scale structures, several
              issues can be  resolved including how microstructural changes make crack 
              propagation energetically more expensive, and using this insight  to reduce the
              brittleness of materials; and using known  correlations between damage
              structures on or below fracture  surfaces with velocity to provide post mortem
              analysis of  fracture velocities.  This interdisciplinary project is co-funded 
              by the Ceramics Program of the Division of Materials Research and  the Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical  and Physical Sciences
              Directorate.  ***
