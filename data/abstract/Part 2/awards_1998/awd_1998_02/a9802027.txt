Abstract    :
                  9802027  Brown    This project is a collaboration between the Miami Museum
              of Science and the Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Greater Miami  (BBBS) to
              empower single-parent families to become actively engaged in the science,
              mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of their children.   It will
              involve, over the course of the project, parents, mentors, and community
              elements to create and expand a resource network and support primarily
              father-absent homes.   The design of the project is focused on providing
              resources and advocacy critical to the success of young children in SMT
              education.  It is a project designed to get parents actively involved with
              their children's science, mathematics, and technology education.  The program
              will serve Dade County, Florida families.  Museum staff and volunteers of BBBS
              will work closely in the development of mentor materials to be nationally
              distributed.  The strategies that are used and refined will be packaged in a
              Tripod Toolkit and Mentor Handbook that can be used by other community groups
              to aid and assist parents in becoming more active in the science, mathematics,
              and technology education of their children.  In addition to the toolkit
              materials, a set of Science/math Matters activities will be included designed
              to promoted science learning in the home with parents and their children. 
              These materials will be produced in both English and Spanish to meet the needs
              of a diverse and multicultural American society.
