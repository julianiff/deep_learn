Abstract    :
              9802308  Morgan    The   Solid State Sciences Committee of the National Academy 
              of  Sciences  proposes to hold its next Forum entitled  "The  Science  of 
              Materials - Strengthening  the  Foundations  of  Technology  and  Innovation"
              in 1998, to coincide  with  the  completion  of  the  National  Research 
              Council's   decadal  assessment  of  the field of condensed-matter and 
              materials  physics  (CMMP).  The format of this Forum will be a two-day 
              meeting,  held  at  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  in  Washington.  The
              Forum will open with a keynote address by a  prominent  policymaker to be
              identified  and  will  continue  with  perspectives  from agency, industry, 
              university,  and  government  laboratory leaders.  The  CMMP  report  will  be 
              prominently featured, with presentations on condensed-matter  and  materials
              physics and its role in U.S. technology,  the  current  status  of  the  field,
               and  the  scientific   and  technological opportunities for the future.  %%%
