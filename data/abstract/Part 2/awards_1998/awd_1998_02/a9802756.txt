Abstract    :
              9802756  Anlage  This award provides partial support for the acquisition and 
              development of a cryogenic scanned near-field microwave  microscope which will
              measure important materials properties  (such as surface sheet resistance,
              complex dielectric  permittivity, complex magnetic permeability, etc.)  at 
              microwave frequencies with a spatial resolution on the order  of 10 nm.  The
              cryogenic operation will allow us to develop  a superconducting near-field
              microwave microscope with  greatly enhanced sensitivity.  The microscope will
              also be  configured to measure microwave current distributions in 
              superconducting microwave devices at 100 nm resolution, for  the purpose of
              understanding the microscopic origins of  nonlinearity in these devices.  In
              one mode of operation, we  will obtain high spatial resolution microwave images
              which  will be free of the effects of sample topography.  In other 
              configurations, the microscope will also use a scanning  bolometer to measure
              spatially resolved temperature  variations in superconducting microwave
              devices.  A scanning  single-electron transistor, operating at 4.2 K, will be
              used  to sensitively image very small electric fields and charges.  Finally,
              the microscope will be used in conjunction with an  existing microwave network
              analyzer for imaging with  calibrated broadband electromagnetic field and
              conductivity  measurements.  %%%  ***
