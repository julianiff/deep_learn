              Solitons and Nonlinear Periodic Structures    Abstract    This is a proposal
              requesting support for student travel for the Workshop on Novel Solitons and
              Nonlinear Periodic Structures to be held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
              , March 30-April 3, 1998.     The workshop is intended to be an international
              forum for young scientist in the rapidly expanding field of optics and material
              sciences.
