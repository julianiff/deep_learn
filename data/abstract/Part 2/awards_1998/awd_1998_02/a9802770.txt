This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Research award is for a
              workshop on mathematical biology to be held in Zakopane, Poland, from June 21
              to 26, 1998.  The principal investigators for the U.S. are Dr. William E.
              Fitzgibbon of the University of Houston and Dr. Marek Kimmel of Rice
              University.  The principal investigator for the Polish side is Dr. Jerzy
              Golubowicz, Vice Director of the Institute of Environmental Engineering of the
              Polish Academy of Sciences.  The objective of the workshop is to establish an
              international collaborative research program.  The workshop will bring together
              applied mathematicians and theoretical biologists from the U.S. with field
              biologists, population biologists, and environmentalists from Poland and
              Central Eastern Europe (Belarus, Bohemia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland,
              Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine).  The European contingent will include
              individuals gathering field data on the distribution and dynamics of mammalian
              diseases and the spread and individuals seeking to control the spread of
              pathogenic organisms.  The region includes both unspoiled natural habitats and
              areas of unprecedented industrial pollution.  Mathematical modeling and
              simulation are becoming an increasingly useful methodology for understanding
              the spread of pathogens and diseases and assessing the impact of pollutants and
              predicting their future course and evaluating the adequacy of remedial
              measures.        

This research in applied mathematics (mathematical
              biology) fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
              in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
