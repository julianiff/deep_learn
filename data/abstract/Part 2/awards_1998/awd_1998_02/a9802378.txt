A
              first goal of this project is to use symplectic reduction theory and
its
              extension involving singularities to the study of various
mechanical systems
              and coadjoint orbits of finite and infinite
dimensional Lie groups. In
              addition, these techniques will be applied
to symmetric Hamiltonian
              bifurcation theory by combining them with
methods of dynamical systems and
              classical bifurcation theory methods.
A Lagrangian counterpart of reduction
              will be developed, where
symplectic geometry techniques are replaced by
              variational principles.
Applications of these variational methods yield the
              equations of
various approximate models in geophysical fluid dynamics.  A
              second
goal of this project is to understand completions of
              diffeomorphism
groups with the scope of applying geometric and Lie
              theoretical
methods to the study of nonlinear wave equations and the
              understanding
of the convexity properties of the momentum map in
              infinite
dimensions. A third goal is the application of methods of
              Hamiltonian
dynamics in conjunction with singular reduction to study
              the
bifurcation and the long term behavior of concrete mechanical
              systems
such as the Riemann ellipsoids. The same methods are intended for
              the
design and study of numerical algorithms on nonlinear
              manifolds.

Symplectic methods in geometric mechanics are a powerful tool
              to
address difficult questions in the dynamics of concrete problems such
as
              the control of submarine or robotic arm motion, the elaboration of
models for
              continuum systems such as rods and shells, or the study of
the shape of liquid
              or gaseous masses ranging from tiny drops to
galaxies. The development of the
              geometric foundations to attack these
problems as well as their application to
              several problems comprises
the work to be done on this grant.
