Abstract    :
              This project will concentrate on set theory and applications of set theory in
              algebra. The major topics of research will include left-distributive algebras,
              elementary embeddings, stationary sets, the theory of large cardinals,
              applications of forcing, the singular cardinals problem and the theory of
              possible cofinalities, countably complete filters and ideals, infinitary
              combinatorics, and problems in Boolean algebras.

The proposed research deals
              with the abstract mathematical discipline called set theory. Set theory serves
              as the foundation for other mathematical disciplines such as topology, measure
              theory, and functional analysis. Its study of abstract infinite sets provides
              an invaluable insight into the expressive power of modern mathematics and its
              limitations. In particular, modern set theory with its emphasis on independence
              proofs and the theory of large cardinals enables to establish provability or
              unprovability and analyze the complexity of mathematical conjectures.
