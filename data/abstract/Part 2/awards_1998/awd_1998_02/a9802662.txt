Abstract    :
              Funding is to support a workshop (spring 1998) to explore challenges in digital 
              system design posed by the very large integrated circuits (systems-on-silicon) 
              made possible by advances in VLSI technology. With 100 million transistor chips
               imminent and 500-million transistor designs feasible, there is a pressing need
               to assess what new design technologies and methodologies must be created to
              make  the creation of such systems feasible. Workshop participants include CAD
              and  design experts from both academia and industry. The workshop report
              includes: 1)  a statement of pressing problems posed by systems-on-silicon; 2)
              recommendations  about important research areas relating to systems-on-silicon;
              and 3) viewpoints  on how to make these CAD and design communities aware of
              these trends and  challenges.
