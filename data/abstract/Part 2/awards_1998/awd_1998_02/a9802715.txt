Abstract    :
              9802715  Nielsen      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Karina J. Nielsen of Oregon State 
              University to work with Drs. Sergio A. Navarrete and Juan  Carlos Castilla at
              Catholic University in Santiago, Chile,  and with Professor Bruce A. Menge and
              Jane Lubchenco at  Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  Her research 
              is on upwelling patterns and marine plant herbivore  interactions. 
              Specifically, Dr. Nielsen and her Chilean  collaborators will look at several
              sites along the central  Chilean coast which have different community
              composition and  which have important differences in productivity and 
              upwelling conditions to measure the nature and intensity of  the link between
              nutrients, macroalgae and herbivory.  Upon  Dr. Nielsen's return to Oregon, she
              will compare her results  with work done in New Zealand and Oregon by her U.S. 
              collaborators.  This research will provide baseline data on  the structure and
              dynamics of rocky intertidal communities  along both north and southeastern
              Pacific shores, allowing  the evaluation of the ecological consequences of
              global  change on coastal marine communities.    Dr. Navarrete is the director
              of the Estacion Costera de  Investigaciones Marinas of Las Cruces, which is one
              of the  best facilities for marine research in South America.  In  addition to
              Drs. Navarrete and Castilla, Dr. Nielsen will be  working closely with Drs.
              Bernabe Santelices and Juan  Correas, who are world experts on the physiology
              and ecology  of intertidal macroalgae.  ***
