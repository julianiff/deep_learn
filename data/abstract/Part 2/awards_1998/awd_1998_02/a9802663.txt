The investigator has collaborated recently with Benjamini,
              Peres and Schramm in the area of probabilistic processes on graphs whose
              distributions are invariant under automorphisms of the graph.  One of the areas
              concerns uniform spanning trees, where an enormous number of new questions have
              opened up because of the interconnections of the field with other areas of
              probability such as random walks and Dirichlet functions.  The investigator
              proposes to work on several such questions.  Another area concerns percolation,
              both classical Bernoulli percolation and more general invariant percolation.  A
              large number of questions in this area are also proposed.

The earliest
              result directly related to this investigator's work was discovered by the
              physicist Kirchhoff in 1847, who showed that electrical network problems are
              precisely related to certain probabilistic properties of special subnetworks
              called spanning trees.  The connections between these topics have flourished in
              recent years and have also found links to other fundamental probabilistic
              processes known as random walks and percolation.  Random walks model many sorts
              of random change, such as prices on the stock market.  Percolation is a
              probabilistic model of diffusion through a porous medium, such as groundwater
              seeping through soil.  The proposed work involves various connections among
              these and other fields.  The investigator aims to further the fundamental
              understanding that is part of basic research.
