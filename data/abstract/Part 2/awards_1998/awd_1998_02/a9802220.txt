              Research Infrastructure:  Exploring 3D Environments

This award provides
              support for the computational infrastructure of a new computer graphics
              laboratory.  The requested equipment consists of a high performance computer
              server, a high performance 3D graphics server, a high performance
              image/video/geometry server, peripheral devices such as a 3D digitizer, and a
              technical staff member to manage the equipment. The investigators will be
              working in the areas of capture, involving the automatic acquisition of 3D
              urban scenes and computational video techniques for organizing and interacting
              with video objects; in exploration, including research in immersive image-based
              virtual environments, hybrid geometry and imaged-based representations, and
              hardware for accelerated walk-throughs; and in design and simulation, with
              research in computer-aided lighting and acoustic modeling, interactive
              high-fidelity rendering, weathering and surface appearance, and photomontage. 
              A broad spectrum of application domains will benefit from this work, including
              construction and renovation, visual impact studies, crisis management, and
              training tools in applications, such as manufacturing processes and vehicle
              operation.
