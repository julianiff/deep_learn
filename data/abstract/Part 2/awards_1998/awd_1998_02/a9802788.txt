This award provides support for the acquisition of an
              infrared microscope, a dedicated research-grade spectrometer for the
              microscope, and the associated accessories for temperature dependent
              measurements of important materials over the frequency range of the instrument.
               This setup will be devoted to the spectroscopic study of novel materials,
              particularly C60-based photopolymer films and small single crystal organic and
              inorganic solids, the characterization of which is supported under other NSF
              funded programs.  In addition to facilitating the infrared work in our group,
              the proposed equipment will aid in the training of undergraduate, graduate, and
              postdoctoral students in the area of materials spectrocopy.  The microscope
              will be installed in a facility under renovation by an NSF-STI award, which
              will house all the materials chemists and physicists.
