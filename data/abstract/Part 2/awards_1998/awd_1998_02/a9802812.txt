Abstract    :
              9802812  Pope      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Denise S. Pope to work with Dr. John 
              Christy at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in  Balboa, Panama.   
              Dr. Pope will use fiddler crabs as a model system to study  the theories of
              sexual selection and animal communication to  understand the evolution of
              sexually dimorphic exaggerated  traits.  Using signal detection theory, she
              will study the  claw waving display of male fiddler crabs, which is done to 
              threaten other males and to attract females for mating.  Her  studies will use
              a video playback technique for the  presentation of stimuli.  She will present
              females with  videos of displays produced by males in different  situations,
              and against different backgrounds.  This test  will distinguish between female
              preference for detectability  and female preference for a more exaggerated
              signal.    Dr. Christy has studied sexual selection and communication  in
              fiddler crabs for twenty years.  The Smithsonian Tropical  Research Institute
              has well-equipped facilities, and  provides a location where these crabs are
              found in the  greatest diversity and where the genus is thought to have 
              originated.    ***
