Abstract    :
                AST 98-02984  Arlin P. Crotts    The PI is continuing a survey of
              gravitational microlensing of stars in M31.  This complements the surveys for
              MACHOs (massive compact halo objects) in the direction of the Large Magellanic
              Cloud and the Galactic Bulge.  The PI has already constructed the major
              hardware for this effort, has written the software to find variable stars in
              highly crowded fields, and has large blocks of telescope time at the 1.8 meter
              Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and the MDM 1.3 meter telescope.    Using
              M31 to search for MACHOs is particularly interesting because it is the only
              external spiral galaxy that can be successfully probed for dark matter in this
              way.  It is different from the Galaxy in that sightlines through the halo have
              associated with them a possibly high optical depth (or probability per star) of
              halo microlensing.  This promises to produce a stronger halo lensing signal
              that the Galactic case.  Furthermore, this signal is variable across the face
              of the galaxy, and this can be used to further constrain halo dark matter
              distribution models.  It is likely that this localization of the halo mass will
              also lead to better estimates of the source-lens-observer geometry, and hence
              the component masses of the objects acting as lenses    ***
