Abstract    :
                AST-9802955  Hardee    Dr. Hardee will carry out a study of the dynamics and
              emission from the highly collimated jet outflows observed in a variety of
              astrophysical environments, including extragalactic radio sources, quasars, and
              galactic superluminals.  The research combines a variety of approaches :
              analytical analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic fluid equations to establish
              model dependence on parameters, numerical simulation to study non-linear
              processes and test the applicability of the analytical theory, and modeling of
              the dynamics and the emission from the jets and comparison to observations of
              individual objects.    ***
