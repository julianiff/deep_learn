Abstract    :
              The grant is for support of students to attend the Second International
              Conference on Exotic Nuclei and Atomic Masses, ENAM98.  The conference is the
              second in a series that is the merger of the long running Atomic Mass
              Conference and the Nuclei Far From Stability Conference.  These conferences
              began in the late 1960s.  The tradition of the meeting is to gather in a remote
              location and review the progress in the field.  The advent of experiments with
              radioactive ion beams has increased the interest in this conference series. 
              ENAM98 will be held June 23 to June 27 in Northern Michigan at the Shanty Creek
              Resort.  It will be an excellent opportunity for students to get an overview of
              the science associated with radioactive ion beams.  Special sessions will be
              held for only students to over view the talks and allow them to ask questions.
