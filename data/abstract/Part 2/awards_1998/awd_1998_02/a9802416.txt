This U.S.-Czech research project between Andrzej
              Proskurowski of the University of Oregon, Eugene, and Jan Kratochvil of Charles
              University, Prague, features interactions and computational aspects of basic
              concepts in geometry, graph theory, linear algebra, and combinatorics.  Project
              objectives include:  1) investigation of the use of theoretical graph models in
              studies of various geometric structures and 2) development of computational
              experiments that will facilitate exploration of properties.  Specifically, the
              investigators will study equiangular lines, graph switching, intersection
              representations of graphs, bounded pathwidth, and graph covering problems. 
              While this research is largely fundamental, results do have potential for
              application in computer graphics and scheduling.

This project in computing
              theory fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.
