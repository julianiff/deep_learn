Abstract    :
              9802198 Kawatra Fly ashes produced by the new low-NOx coal combusters contain
              high concentrations (>6% by weight) of unburned carbon, making them less usable
              as concrete additives because of the adsorptive properties of the carbon. The
              objective of this research is to better understand the behavior of fly-ash in
              binder applications, to use this information to determine methods for
              controlling the kinetics of the binding reaction and to optimize fly-ash binder
              characteristics for particular industrial applications. Such knowledge and
              understanding could lead to the economic use of fly-ash as binders, in foundry
              sands, for example. Specific questions to be answered by this research are as
              follows:
1. What are the effects of fly-ash composition on binder
              properties?
2. What are the properties of particulates which will affect both
              their interaction with fly-ash binders and their utilization by industry?
3.
              What are the details of the fly-ash binding mechanism and how can binding be
              optimized?
4. How can the behavior of fly-ash based binders be optimized for
              various industrial applications?
Successful use as binders would not only
              reduce the volume of materials requiring disposal, but would reduce the use of
              other materials used as binders.  Therefore pollution prevention would be
              realized by waste recovery and reuse.
