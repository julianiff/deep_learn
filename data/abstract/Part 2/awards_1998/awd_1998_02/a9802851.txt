Abstract    :
                AST-9802851  Timbie    Dr. Timbie and Dr. Ruhl are collaborating on a
              two-phase program to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB), first at
              large angular scales and later at small scales.  This program operates in a
              single millimeter frequency band (26-36 GHz).  .Recent measurements of the
              spectrum and the spatial anisotropy of the 2.7K CMB have dramatically improved
              our understanding of the early universe.  The third characteristic of this
              radiation, its polarization, has not yet been detected.  The amplitude of the
              linear polarization and its spatial distribution are extremely sensitive to
              both the source of the temperature anisotropy (density perturbations or
              gravitational waves) and the ionization history of the universe.  The predicted
              polarization amplitude is less than or equal to 10% of the size of the COBE
              (Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer) anisotropy signals at 7o.  The research
              team is using new receiver technology with 100 times more sensitivity than
              previous polarization experiments, as well as a novel instrument design.     
              Detection of polarization will help to:  provide details about the formation of
              structure in the universe; complement CMB temperature anisotropy measurements
              of cosmological parameters; determine if recombination was instantaneous;
              determine the redshift of reionization; distinguish between inflation and
              defect models for structure formation; probe magnetic fields in the early
              universe and in clusters of galaxies; understand galactic and extragalactic
              sources of polarized radiation.  ***
