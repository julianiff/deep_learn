Abstract    :
              9802629  Ham    This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the  Promotion
              of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Hee J. Ham at the Institute
              of Industrial Science, Tokyo  University in Japan.  Dr. Ham will work with Dr.
              Shuzo  Murakami of the Institute of Industrial Science on a  research project
              entitled, "Numerical Simulation and Novel  Tool Analysis of Dynamic
              Wind-Structure Interactions for Low-  Rise Structures."    The proposed
              research will involve applying computational  fluid dynamics to simulate
              dynamic and unsteady wind flow  and low-rise structure interactions.  The
              results will be  compared with physical wind-tunnel simulation data.  Novel 
              tools (proper orthogonal decomposition and  continuous/discrete wavelet
              analysis) will be developed and  applied to both data sets simulated by
              physical and  numerical methods to characterize the dynamic wind flow and  load
              patterns.  The results of this cooperative research  will improve the
              development of methods for mitigating the  effects of dynamic surface pressure
              fluctuations on low-rise  structures due to extreme wind.  ***
