Abstract    :
                  9802852  Mitchell       This project addresses problems in three distinct
              but closely  related areas of homotopy theory: (1) homotopy fixed point spectra
               arising from the action of closed subgroups of the Morava stabilizer  group on
              the Landweber exact spectrum whose coefficient ring is the  functions on the
              Lubin-Tate moduli space of lifts (Devinatz); (2)  multiplicative stable
              homotopy theory, the homotopy theory of operads,  Andre-Quillen homology of
              algebras over simplicial operads (Goerss);  and (3) etale homotopy type of
              rings of algebraic integers, with a  view to applications in Iwasawa theory and
              algebraic K-theory  (Mitchell).       The broader goal of the project is to
              further our understanding  of homotopy theory, the branch of topology concerned
              with those  properties of higher-dimensional surfaces and other geometric
              objects  that remain invariant under deformation.  There are some surprising 
              and rather mysterious connections between homotopy theory and  seemingly
              unrelated fields such as number theory and algebraic  geometry, and it is these
              connections that the investigators hope to  elucidate.  ***
