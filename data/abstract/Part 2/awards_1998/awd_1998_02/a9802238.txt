Abstract    :
                    Abstract -  Dumesic - 9802238    Combined microcalorimetry, spectroscopy,
              reaction kinetics measurements, and electronic density functional calculations
              will be used to quantitatively study the reactivity of light hydrocarbons with
              Pt-based catalysts. The study is extended to quantitatively characterizing the
              promotion of  Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh metals by Sn and alkali metals. The metals will
              be supported on Cab-O-Sil, silicalite, and K-L zeolite. The hydrogenolysis of
              ethane, esters, and selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes will be
              used as probe reactions. The long-term outcome of this research will be highly
              selective metal catalysts for hydrocarbon reactions.    The study will involve
              U. Wisconsin facilities for in-situ Moessbauer spectroscopy (119Sn Moessbauer
              for oxidation state and coordination of Sn), TEM (for metal particle size),
              FTIR and microcalorimetry (of adsorbed H2, CO, alkenes, alcohols, ethyl
              acetate, and acrolein), chemisorption (of hydrogen, oxygen, and CO), and
              steady-state and transient isotopic-label kinetics. It will also involve
              collaboration with theoretical scientists and engineers at the U. Wisconsin and
              in Denmark.
