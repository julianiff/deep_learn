There are many examples of fluids that are actually weak gels
              due to the presence of structure in the materials on length scales much larger
              than molecular dimensions.  Below some critical yield stress, these structured
              fluids are solids, characterized by a modulus.  In most cases, this modulus
              cannot be measured in commercially available rheological instrumentation
              because those rheometers cannot apply low enough stresses.  However, by simply
              combining technologies that have been proven to work in various rheometers, it
              is possible to construct a creep rheometer capable of applying three orders of
              magnitude lower stress levels than "state of the art" commercial rheometers. 
              This new rheometer will allow application of stresses below the yield stress,
              to measure the modulus of  the unbroken structure.  Application of stresses in
              the vicinity of the yield stress will allow detailed studies of yielding in
              structured fluids.  This information is needed for needed for modeling the
              rheology of structured fluids, as the entire rheological response (even at high
              stresses) is due to structure breaking.  Examples of such structured fluids
              that we are currently studying are:  swollen gels, liquid crystal polymers,
              block copolymers, polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes, suspensions, surfactant
              solutions and foods.  The new rheometer will lead to breakthroughs in our
              understanding of each of these classes of materials because it will allow, for
              the first time, characterization of the linear response and the first
              departures from linear response.  This rheometer is, therefore, vital to the
              long-term research and education plans of the Penn State Rheology
              Group.
