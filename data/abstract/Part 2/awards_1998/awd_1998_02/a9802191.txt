Abstract    :
              ***  9802191  Hollis  This project builds on results from previous NSF grant
              IRI9420869: "Magnetic Levitation Haptic Interfaces."  The previous grant
              developed a haptic interface (force/torque feedback) interaction capability for
              computer  users based on Lorentz magnetic levitation. The user interacts with a
              single moving part with three  rotational and three translational degrees of
              freedom (DOF) floating above the desktop.  Combined with  advances in
              physically-based  simulation methods, it provided computer users convincingly
              real haptic (sense of touch) interaction  with computers through
              six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) position input and 6-DOF force/torque output to the
               user's hand at resolutions of approximately 10 microns and a position
              bandwidth of approximately 75 Hz.  The present effort seeks to make several
              technology enhancements and to quantitatively measure the  psychophysical
              effectiveness of this approach.  Comparisons are being made for haptic
              interaction with  virtual environments and telemanipulation environments, and
              both of these with real environments to  quantitatively clarify the differences
              between these modes.  Methods for robustly "caching" local  haptically-relevant
              regions of the virtual environment are being explored to smoothly synchronize
              the  visual and haptic displays.  Psychophysical methods are employed in the
              design of the human-computer  interface to provide a controlled setting for
              conducting psychophysical measurements.  Finally,  detailed psychophysical
              measurements are being performed with the developed experimental system to 
              quantitatively measure the degree of reality provided.  The knowledge gained
              from this work provides  needed information for the engineering science of
              haptic interface design while helping to elucidate  the nature of haptic
              interaction itself.  ***
