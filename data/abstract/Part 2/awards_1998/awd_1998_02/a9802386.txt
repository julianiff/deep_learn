Abstract    :
              9802386
Dwyer
     The investigators are working on a number of problems from
              algebraic
and geometric topology.  Dwyer is extending earlier research on
              the
homotopy theory of topological groups and on the relationship
              between
algebraic K-theory and number theory.  Taylor is studying
              smooth
4-manifolds, looking into some algebraic results at the heart
              of
geometric topology and developing applications of controlled topology
to
              stratified spaces.  Williams is concentrating on Reimann-Roch
Theorems in
              differential topology, in particular, by generalizing these
theorems to
              related theories and finding applications of them to
stratified spaces and to
              curvature questions.
     The researchers in this project are concerned with
              geometry, both
with the behavior of visible shapes and the more mysterious
              qualities
of higher dimensional configurations.  They work on
              developing
techniques for making spatial calculations, and also on
              finding
instances in which simple geometrical ideas can clarify other kinds
              of
mathematics.  Some of the specific questions the investigators study
are
              quite complex, but the fundamental goal of the field of topology
in which they
              are involved goes back to the Greeks: it is to
understand better the
              relationship between number and shape, between
quantities that can be
              manipulated by calculation and the more
elusive spatial forms (of all
              dimensions) that arise repeatedly in
mathematics and other sciences.
