Abstract    :
              Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9802612   Principal Investigator:  Jim Bryan    This
              project investigates topological and geometric invariants  that are related to,
              and sometimes inspired by, dualities that  arise in physics in string theory. 
              Of primary interest are  versions of the Gromov-Witten and Seiberg-Witten
              invariants for  families of symplectic structures.  Bryan's project will apply 
              these invariants to various problems in enumerative algebraic  geometry,
              symplectic geometry, and low-dimensional topology.  Specifically, he will use
              his techniques to solve large classes  of enumerative problems for K3 surfaces,
              Abelian varieties and  other elliptic surfaces.  He will extend these
              techniques to  compute Gromov-Witten invariants for higher dimensional
              varieties  in order to verify predictions made by mirror symmetry.  He will 
              use Seiberg-Witten theory for families to investigate the extent  to which the
              K3 surface is characterized by its twistor family.  He will extend his
              techniques developed in earlier work for  studying cyclic group actions on
              4-manifolds using Seiberg-Witten  theory.  The extended techniques should apply
              to other groups,  to 3-manifolds, and to real structures on algebraic surfaces.
                 Recent progress made by theoretical physicists in super-symmetric  string
              theories have led to many intriguing and largely  conjectural interconnections
              between very different aspects  of geometry and topology.  Bryan's project will
              elucidate  some of the geometry that underlies these physical theories; 
              physicists hope super-symmetric string theory will eventually  give a complete
              theory of the universe.
