              Infrastructure:  Systems Science for Physical Geometric Algorithms

Research
              in Physical Geometric Algorithms (PGA) studies computational processes that
              compute or reason about geometric or spatial relationships in the physical
              world, and their realization in a variety of application areas. These areas
              include Robotics, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), Computational Biology,
              Scientific and Image Processing, Image Analysis, and Systems Simulation. 
              Collectively, these techniques take on the  problems associated with
              manipulating massive amounts of data associated with a physical system model. 
              Research in PGA pursues the proposition that, for such systems, predictions of
              behavior, arguments of correctness, and combinatorial precision devolve to a
              geometric analysis. At interesting scales these areas have in common their
              exploitation of networks, remote databases, local area clusters, disk farms
              (both local and remote), parallel processing, and graphics. This project will
              develop new Systems Science techniques (particularly algorithms, analysis,
              modeling techniques, and methodology) for addressing latency, bandwidth,
              security, scalability, scheduling, temporal variation in access, and parallel
              high-performance computing for these applications.

The equipment provided by
              this grant enables our application research groups and systems research groups
              to synergistically develop common system solutions to these critical
              performance issues, as well as set new directions in both applications and
              systems problem areas.
