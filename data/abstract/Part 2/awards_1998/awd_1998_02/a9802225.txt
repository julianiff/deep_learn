Abstract    :
              Singularly perturbed partial differential equations are 
used to model boundary
              and interior layers in transport 
and fluid flow, and in high frequency wave
              propagation. 
It is difficult to approximate the solution to these equations
              
because of regions of rapid change in the solution. 
The best approximation
              properties of solutions to 
some singularly perturbed linear partial
              differential 
equations will be studied. The research will build on 
some
              recent work of Kellogg and Stynes that treats a
singularly perturbed self
              adjoint problem. Equations that 
model convection and wave propagation will be
              studied. 
The goal is to obtain the best approximation properties 
(in the
              sense of Kolmogorov) when the data of the problem 
are restricted to have a
              specified smoothness. A 
successful resolution of these best approximation
              
problems will lead to asymptotic expansions of the 
solution with minimal
              smoothness requirements on the 
data, and hopefully to better numerical
              methods for the 
numerical computation of these solutions.

Physical systems
              that involve boundary and interior 
layers are of considerable importance in
              industrial 
applications.  A typical example is the turbulent layer of 
air
              near an aircraft wing.  Wave propagation problems, 
arising e.g. in radar or
              ultrasound are important in 
both medical and military applications. These
              seemingly 
different problems are similar in that there are 
phenomena taking
              place over a very short span of distance or 
time. This leads to difficulties
              in calculating the behavior 
of such systems. The research under this award
              will study the basic 
approximation properties of the equations governing
              these 
systems.
