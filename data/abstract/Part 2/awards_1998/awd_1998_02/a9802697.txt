Abstract    :
              Stephens  9802697    "Foraging" is the process of searching for, attacking,  and
              processing food and other resources. Scientists  study foraging in several
              ways: some investigators  address the psychological and neural apparatus of 
              resource-seeking behavior; others study the structures  and physiology of
              resource acquisition (for example,  mouth pads and digestive processes); still
              others focus  on how foraging influences the structure of ecosystems.  This
              diversity has meant that investigators working at  one level, seldom have
              opportunities to interact with  those working at another. This project supports
              an  international conference on foraging behavior that will  bring many of
              these investigators together. The  conference, at the University of California
              at Santa  Cruz, will consist of 18 invited presentations selected  to represent
              an array of approaches, and approximately  80 contributed presentations.    The
              conference seeks to promote an improved and better  integrated view of foraging
              behavior. This is both  practically and conceptually important. For example, 
              many scientists now feel that a deeper understanding of  the brain and nervous
              system will be a key challenge  for the next decade: analysis of animal
              foraging  behavior can provide clues to the types of cognitive  problems that
              neural processes were built to solve. At  a different level of biological
              organization, many  critical ecological relationships are, in fact, feeding 
              relationships, and so an improved knowledge of foraging  behavior can improve
              the decisions in the use and  management of natural ecosystems.
