Abstract    :
                Chronic Mountain Sickness (CMS) is an often fatal condition characterized by
              poor breathing, low blood oxygen levels, too many red blood cells, and high
              pressure in blood vessels of the lung.  People develop CMS after years of life
              at altitudes above 9000 ft.  This study is designed to determine whether sex
              hormones (testosterone, estrogen and progesterone), through their effects on
              red blood cell production and breathing, increase the risk for men or give
              women protection from developing CMS.  Forty persons with CMS and an equal
              group of similarly-aged healthy persons living in Leadville, CO (10,150 feet)
              will be examined to determine: (1) whether blood oxygen levels are lower in men
              and women with CMS; (2) whether the hormone, erythropoietin, which stimulates
              red blood cell production, is related to blood oxygen and sex hormone levels;
              and (3) whether blood oxygen and hormone levels relate to the numbers of red
              blood cells in these men and women.  This information will improve our
              understanding of the causes of CMS, the ways in which people adapt to the
              stress of living at high altitudes, and permit estimates of CMS prevalence and
              risk in Colorado.
