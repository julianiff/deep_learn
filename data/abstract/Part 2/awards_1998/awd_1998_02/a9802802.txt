Abstract    :
                AST 98-02802  Edwin Turner    Dr. Turner is pursuing three investigations: 
              (1) to continue ongoing photometric monitoring of candidate and known lens
              systems using the APO 3.5m; (2) to make follow-up observations of new
              candidates lens systems identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data;
              (3) to conduct related theoretical investigations.    Gravitational lensing is
              a powerful tool for studying fundamental problems in cosmology and
              astrophysics.  Dr. Turner is using the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m
              telescope to continue photometric monitoring of candidate and known
              gravitational lens systems.  The light curves are used to measure the expansion
              rate of the universe, to test the lens hypothesis for controversial systems and
              to detect microlensing events with fundamental implications for the nature of
              dark matter and the very small scale spatial structure of quasars.  Dr. Turner
              is assembling a well controlled statistical sample containing perhaps hundreds
              of lens systems.  ***
