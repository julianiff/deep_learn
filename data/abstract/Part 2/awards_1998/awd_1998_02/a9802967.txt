Abstract    :
              9802967  Oseroff    This Americas Program award will fund a three-year 
              cooperative research project between Dr. Saul Oseroff, San  Diego State
              University (SDSU), and Dr. Maria T. Causa,  Centro Atomico Bariloche (CAB),
              Argentina,  on a study of  the magnetic properties of some colossal magneto
              resistance  systems.  The purpose is to explain the origin of Electron  Spin
              Resonance (ESR)  linewidth and the entities that give  rise to the ESR line. 
              Also, to learn how they are related  to the huge magnetoresistance measured in 
              these materials.  ESR is a powerful technique to probe local crystal and 
              magnetic field effects that could play an important role in  understanding the
              magnetic behavior of these systems.    The discovery of a huge magnetoresistive
              response, now  termed colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), in  perovskite 
              manganate has renewed attention to these systems.  The study  of CMR in this
              class of compounds is important for both the  search for a model to explain
              their magneto transport  properties and for their possible application as
              magnetic  sensors.   The research is expected to provide new insight  into the
              physics of these materials, and could result in  important and novel
              technological applications.    ***
