Abstract    :
              The area of databases has evolved rapidly in recent years in response to new
              requirements of advanced applications. Databases must now handle a wide variety
              of data types, ranging from relational to textual, sequential, spatial, audio,
              etc. Data is increasingly heterogeneous and globally distributed among a
              variety of sources. And, applications increasingly require functionalities such
              as activeness. These developments pose new challenges to the design and
              implementation of query and update languages, and raise fundamentally novel
              issues that require developing specific, principled approaches. The aim of the
              proposed research is to develop such approaches to querying and updating
              advanced database systems, focusing primarily on the logical level: languages
              and computational aspects. The results of the project are expected to yield
              better understanding of basic problems facing current database systems, and
              will provide tools to facilitate the principled design and implementation of
              query and update languages. They will contribute to technological advances in
              several fast-developing areas: representing and querying information on the
              Web, applications requiring activeness capabilities (such as electronic
              commerce), and applications handling heterogeneous data (such as spatial
              databases).     http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/vianu/IIS-9802288.html
