Abstract    :
              9802816  Edlund    The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Mark B. Edlund of the University of
              Michigan to  work with Dr. Ts. Jamsran at Mongolian State University in 
              Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia as well at the University of Michigan  with Dr. Eugene
              Stoermer on biatom diversity and training in  Lake Hovsgol National Park. 
              Partial support is being  provided by the East Asia-Pacific Program in the
              Division of  International Programs.    Dr. Edlund will study a component of
              the algal flora of Lake  Hovsgol, completing a floristic survey, and create an 
              herbarium of diatoms (single cell microscopic algae) and a  reference
              collection.  Lake Hovsgol is an ancient ecosystem  in a tectonic basin.  Lakes
              such as Hovsgol have existed for  millions of years and are natural
              laboratories for the study  of ecology and evolution.  It has been named
              Mongolia's  first International Long-Term Ecological Research site  (LTER). 
              Because this site is at risk ecologically, it is  important to document its
              diversity.  In addition to  performing this documentation, Dr. Edlund will be
              working  with Mongolian scientists, helping to train and prepare them  for
              future research collaborations with the United States.  ***
