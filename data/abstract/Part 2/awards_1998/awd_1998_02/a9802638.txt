Abstract    :
              9802638  Gold    This Americas Program award will support a cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Scott E. Gold, University of  Georgia, and Drs.
              Jose Ruiz Herrera and Alfredo Martinez  Espinoza, Centro de Investigacion y de
              Estudios Avanzados,  (CINVESTAV), Irapuato, Mexico.    The objective of the
              project is to elucidate underlying  mechanisms controlling dimorphism in the
              fungus Ustilago  maydis, the causal agent of corn smut disease.  These fungi 
              grow in two morphologies, as a budding yeast form or as long  tubular cells or
              filaments.  The yeast cells do not attack  the plants, but the filaments can. 
              This fungus dimorphism  is known to be affected by genetic programming and by 
              environmental conditions.  The two groups of researchers  have independently
              discovered mutations in genes that  control the ability of the fungus to
              alternate between the  two forms, and both have observed similar phenotypic 
              results.  Their overall goal for this collaboration is to  determine the
              interaction between the two morphogenic  triggers.  To accomplish this, they
              have designed an  experimental program to investigate the relationship between 
              the two signal response pathways and, specifically, to  determine how the
              environment regulates dimorphism.    The topic of morphogenic switching has
              fundamental and  applied significance, both within plant pathology and across 
              biology.  Results of the proposed research could provide  guidance for
              effective strategies for the control of fungal  diseases in plants.  ***
