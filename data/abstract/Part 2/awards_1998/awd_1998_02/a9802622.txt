Abstract    :
              Theoretical and computational techniques are developed and applied to
              recombination of ultra-cold alkali atoms and to anti-hydrogen.  The theory is
              important for understanding recent experiments in Bose-Einstein condensation
              and for trapping experiments to be performed at CERN in the near future.
