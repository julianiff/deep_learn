Abstract    :
                  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the  Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment  Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals  and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within
              it.  This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLBOE Program
              needs: support for an existing  protocol, support for teacher training and
              outreach, data  quality control, student surveys on attitudes about the 
              environment and climate misconceptions, and finally,  scientific research based
              on GLOBE data.  This proposal will support part of the GLOBE atmosphere 
              protocols, focusing on temperature and precipitation.  The  project will
              attempt to integrate the temperature and  precipitation measurements with the
              Hydrology and Cloud  measurements in an `Earth Systems' approach in order to
              give  students a more holistic view of how climate and weather  interact with
              other systems in the environment.
