Abstract    :
              9802033    Means    This is a program to evaluate the GLOBE (Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment) Program.  The evaluation documents the
              program inputs - teacher training, protocols and learning activities and
              technology supports - that provide the context for school and classroom
              implementations and interactions with the GLOBE science community.  Surveys,
              case studies, and records of conversations over the Internet are data sources
              regarding school and classroom implementations and interactions among students
              and between students and scientists.  These implementations and interactions
              are expected to produce the student and science outcomes that are the GLOBE
              program goals.  Students outcomes of environmental awareness and science and
              mathematics learning are addressed through innovative, Web-based student
              assessments and through observations and analysis of student work and
              communications.  To assess science outcomes in a straight forward and
              cost-effective manner, the evaluators will rely on GLOBE scientist' analyses
              and publications in refereed journals as indicators of science contribution.
