Abstract    :
                AST 98-02658  Osmer    The PI is undertaking four projects related to
              production of and use of large area multicolor surveys.  The development of
              high quality, large format CCDs and cameras with multiple CCD detectors has
              been important to observational cosmology.  It is now possible to survey many
              square degrees of the sky with 4 meter class telescopes to limiting magnitudes
              greater than or equal to 25 mag (back to epochs when the universe was less than
              10% of its present age).    The PI proposes four projects:   (1)  to search for
              quasars at redshift>5 to determine when they first become visible, how rapidly
              their space density evolves, and how they relate to the formation of galaxies. 
              (2)  to investigate the luminosity function of quasars at redshift=2 down to
              absolute magnitudes similar to those of nearby AGNs, thereby constraining their
              evolution between the present and the epoch when more luminous quasars reach a
              peak in the evolution of their space density.  (3)  to study the evolution of
              the optical properties of galaxies at redshifts up to 3.5, and   (4)  to study
              the observational relationship between quasars and galaxies over the same range
              in redshift and absolute luminosity.      The PI has begun three surveys:  Two
              of the surveys target objects with redshift >5. The first one covers 1000 deg2
              of sky, the second one covers 50 deg2 of sky.  This second survey is multicolor
              and uses B, V, I filters down to a limiting magnitude of I = 24 mag.  The third
              survey is also multicolor and uses B, R, I filters.  It covers 8 deg2 of sky
              down to a limiting magnitude of R = 25.7 mag.  This third survey searches for
              quasars with  3.3<redshift<5.0.  The PI is adding to the third survey
              observations in U,V over 3 deg2.  ***
