This Americas Program award will give partial support for
              a Latin American workshop  on computational and applied mathematics, to be held
              in Santiago, Chile, in January, 1999.  Organizers are Dr. Jose Castillo, San
              Diego State University, in collaboration with a Panamerican organizing
              committee composed of representatives from Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and
              Venezuela.  Dr. Jose Conca, Universidad de Chile, will chair the local
              organizing committee.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together
              practicing applied and computational mathematicians in the Americas to exchange
              information, foster cooperation between the participating countries,  and
              promote the development of applied mathematics.  It will emphasize areas of
              computation fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, high-performance computing,
              computer algebra, grid generation, and dynamical systems.  Participants
              supported by this grant  include junior researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and
              graduate students.   

Because of the increasing interest in applied and
              computational mathematics in the Americas, and a growth in the use of
              mathematical and computer modeling to address industrial and societal problems
              such as oil recovery, the effects of deforestation, and pollution control, the
              workshop will focus on applications of significant economic and environmental
              importance in the Americas.
