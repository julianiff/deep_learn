Walther
     This award is to determine experimental equilibrium
              solubilities of corundum, and andalusite plus quartz; geologically important
              minerals, at elevated temperatures (400 to 650 C) and pressures (up to 3 kbar)
              in acid solutions and aqueous salt fluids (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 molal HCl and
              NaCl). The experiments supported by this award will involve extracting fluid
              samples while they are at high pressure and temperature with a unique
              hydrothermal apparatus  and then determining the concentration of all volatile
              and non-volatile constituents of the fluid through a battery of modern
              analytical techniques.
     An important part of the theoretical analysis is
              that activity coefficients 
of neutral species must be considered when
              determining the equilibrium.  Hopefully a model of Al speciation as a function
              of pH and ionic strength as well as pressure and temperature can be constructed
              in the Al2O-H2O-NaCl-HCl  system. The proposed experiments should put limits on
              the possible solution compositions from which aluminum can be transported and
              aluminum bearing phases precipitate during metamorphism of the earth's
              crust.
