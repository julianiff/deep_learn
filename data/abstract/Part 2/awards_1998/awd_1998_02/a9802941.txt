Abstract    :
                AST 98-02941  Marscher    Although much progress has been made in exploring
              the nature of quasars, they are now only partly understood.  The energetic
              phenomena  associated with quasars are thought to be powered by accretion only
              massive black holes lying at the centers of the host galaxies.  The fuel would
              be interstellar gas that passes through the nucleus of the galaxy, probably as
              a result of an encounter with another galaxy.  The angular momentum of the
              accreting gas causes it to form a differentially rotating disk surrounding a
              black hole.  In some of these objects - preferentially those that lie at the
              centers of elliptical galaxies - jets of magnetized ultrarelativistic plasma
              flow outward at speeds near that of light along the rotation axis of the disk. 
                Dr. Marscher is studying the nature of the radio jets with highly variable
              nonthermal radiation that are observed in some quasars.  These objects are part
              of the class known as Blazars.  Dr. Marscher is comparing high-resolution,
              high-frequency radio images of actual jets with images of simulated jets
              obtained through hydrodynamic calculations.  The observations will follow
              propagation of new knots down the jets (ejected roughly monthly from the core).
               The nature of the core itself is also explored, and the structure of the
              magnetic field.  ***
