Abstract    :
              9802627  Fleming    This US-Mexico award will support a research workshop on the
               evolution, ecology, and conservation of columnar cacti and  their mutualists
              to be held in Tehuacan, Mexico, near an  area of high cactus density and
              diversity.  Organized by  Prof. Theodore Fleming of the University of Miami and
              Prof.  Alfonso Valiente-Banuet of the National Autonomous  University of Mexico
              (UNAM), the workshop will involve major  researchers studying columnar cacti
              and their mutualists in  the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia,
              and will  feature oral presentations, poster sessions, and formal and  informal
              discussions.    Columnar cacti often are the dominant and ecologically most 
              important plants over vast areas in arid regions of the  southwestern United
              States, Mexico, northern and Andean  South America, and the Caribbean.  These
              plants provide food  and shelter for many species of animals, including
              migratory  birds and bats of conservation concern.  Participants at the 
              workshop will present results of their research and  contribute to a book to be
              edited by the two organizers of  the workshop proceedings.  ***
