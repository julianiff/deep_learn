Abstract    :
              9802022  McWilliams      In this project, TERC, Inc. of Cambridge is addressing
              two strands for the interagency  GLOBE program.  The first is to focus on the
              Teachers Guide that is being produced on an annual basis.  This guide is
              updated and revised and enhances the interweaving of the science protocols and
              learning activities, increases the use of visuals and includes a
              cross-referenced index for the GLOBE teachers.  In addition, TERC is helping
              the GLOBE scientist/educator teams design learning activities that are
              inquiry-based and make use of the GLOBE student data and visualizations.  The
              materials are also to be in web and CD-ROM versions. A second strand is
              developing and implementing new resources to help GLOBE improve its overall
              educational goals.  Resources  include district-wide implementation guides,
              Web-based Netcourses, a GLOBE student research Journal, an activities
              Development Guidebook and a format for On-line communities of GLOBE teachers.
