Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of rigorous and computational methods in
              the study of dynamics.  Specifically, the following will be studied:  1) The
              theory and computation of invariant manifolds and invariant foliations
              (specially non-resonant manifolds, manifolds  of quasiperiodic motions) for
              dynamical systems and PDE;  2) Rigidity phenomena in dynamical systems
              (non-commutative smooth Livsic theory, quasiconformal methods, inducing and
              renormalization);  3) Variational methods (mechanisms of transport and
              applications to PDEs);  4) Hamiltonian formulation of water waves and numerical
              implementations.


The long term behavior of a system may be significantly
              more complicated than the laws governing it.  Even very simple laws of
              evolution, when applied many times, may lead to a variety of behavior which is
              difficult to predict.  A prime example is the behavior of a fluid, whose
              fundamental equations are known and which is accurately predictable over a
              short time, but which can develop, after a time, swirls or turbulence that are
              not easy to predict.  In this project, a broad based approach that combines
              analytical methods and numerical calculations will be used to classify  and
              study quantitatively possible long term behaviors of concrete systems.  Both
              widely applicable-but not quantitative-general theory and quantitative
              calculations (some of them numerical) in concrete models appearing in applied
              problems will be developed.  The study of fluid motion and the motion of
              satellites will be given particular attention.
