Abstract    :
              9802635  Boucias    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a  research
              collaboration between Dr. Drion  G. Boucias of the University of Florida  and
              Dr. Myrian Silvana Tigano of  Embrapa/CENARGEN in Brasilia, Brazil.    These
              researchers will study an insect  mycopathogen that may be used as a  microbial
              control agent against pest  insects.  In Brazil, this fungi,  Nomuraea rileyi,
              was used against the  velvetbean caterpillar, a pest that  infests soybeans,
              and found it was  sufficient to cause a season-long  suppression in the
              population density of  that pest insect. Collecting insect  population data,
              soybean data and  weather data from sites in North  Florida, the Federal
              District of Brazil  and in the central region of Parana, the  reseachers will
              compile, review and  analyze an extensive database on the  disease agent and
              its relation to  various biotic and abiotic factors.  They will develop a joint
              culture  collection that will serve as a valuable  research tool from which
              selected  isolates can be screened for development  as microbial control
              agents.  The data  gathered from these field studies will  increase our
              understanding of how animal  mycopathogens operate in an epizootic  state
              without concomitant selection for  resistance insects.  It may also provide 
              insight into how to manipulate  mycopathogens, which are a sustainable 
              resource for pest insect and plant  management.  ***
