Abstract    :
              AST 98-02708  John Wardle    Dr. Wardle is studying powerful extragalactic radio
              sources at the highest resolution attainable (on a linear scale of parsecs or
              less).  He is using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the Coordinated
              Millimeter VLBI Array.      The energy sources for these extragalactic radio
              sources are observed in the centers of quasars and active galaxies.  Enormous
              amounts of energy are generated in very small volumes, widely though to be due
              to the infall of material onto a supermassive black hole.  At radio wavelengths
              one sees compact 'cores' and elongated 'jets' that vary rapidly in total
              intensity and polarizataion.  Often bright knots of radio emission appear to
              move down the jets at several times the speed of light.      The PI is imaging
              the polarized (synchrotron) radiation from these radio sources at
              milliarcsecond resolution.  Linearly polarized images contain unique
              information about the order and orientation of the magnetic field, and on
              relativistic aberration, that cannot be obtained from total intensity images. 
              Sequences of such images form frames of the "magnetic movie" in which the
              evolution of the magnetic field can be followed in both time and space.  ***
