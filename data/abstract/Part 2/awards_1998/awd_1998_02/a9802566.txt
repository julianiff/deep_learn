Abstract    :
              The University of California, San Diego will coordinate a national workshop to
              enable the university and industry research communities to work together on
              initiatives to improve the quality and effectiveness of research and education
              partnerships.  Building on existing scholarship on this topic, the workshop
              will identify successful principles and best practices for promoting and
              sustaining effective partnerships.

The Principal Investigator and a steering
              committee of leaders from the university and industrial research communities
              will identify workshop topics areas and discussants.  Workshop participants
              will be invited from a variety of technology sectors, company sizes and stages
              of growth, and academic institutions.  Participants with expertise in
              technology transfer, venture capital, and other facilitating roles will also be
              invited.

Results of the workshop will be broadly disseminated to the
              community.
