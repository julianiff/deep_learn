Abstract    :
              The purpose of the Workshop on Managing and Mining Massive Data (M3D-98) is to
              foster interactions among an invited group of computer scientists who are
              interested in developing scalable systems for managing and mining massive data
              sets. The workshop is co-organized by Robert Grossman (University of Illinois,
              Chicago) and Reagan Moore (San Diego Supercomputer Center). The goals of the
              workshop are: to identify promising approaches and technologies for scaling
              data mining to massive data sets; to investigate how data mining can be more
              tightly integrated with databases, digital libraries, data warehouses, and data
              archives; to identify how data mining services can be integrated into the
              emerging national computational infrastructure; and to begin the process of
              developing community data sets, benchmarks, interchanged formats, and testbeds
              appropriate for mining massive data sets. The workshop consists of survey
              talks, background talks and technical talks on different aspects of data mining
              as well as several application talks describing data mining case studies. In
              addition, there are also white papers describing fundamental challenges and
              issues, proposed research agendas, testbeds, emerging standards, and related
              matters. The white papers and related materials will be available to the
              invited participants prior to the workshop and to the general public via a M3D
              web site approximately a month after the workshop.
