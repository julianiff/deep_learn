Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the study of the relationship between a geodesic
              flow on a Riemannian manifold on the one hand, and the asymptotic properties of
              the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the
              other hand.  The principal investigator proposes to continue his study of the
              asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions on manifolds with either completely
              integrable or ergodic geodesic flows.  

The proposed research lies in the
              area of Quantum Chaos.  The subject originated in the study of the spectra of
              the atomic nuclei in the fifties.  Later it was recognized that similar
              phenomena occur in condensed matter physics, disordered systems, ergodic
              theory, random matrices, and analytic number theory.  The questions which are
              often considered include the study of the spacings between high energy levels
              of the system: do they behave like random numbers, or are they more regular?
              Other questions concern eigenfunctions: do they become uniformly distributed
              over the phase space or do they become highly concentrated in certain regions? 
              Many experiments suggest that the answers depend on the classical dynamics of
              the system. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the precise
              nature of that dependence, but many mathematical questions remain unsolved. The
              questions considered in this proposal are related to the problems that arise in
              building certain components of quantum computers.
