Abstract    :
              This workshop is a joint Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and Solar and
              Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) meeting focusing on the solar interior and
              prospects for similar studies on solar-like stars. Working group sessions,
              plenary discussions, and poster sessions will address topics such as the
              observational status of low-, medium-, and high-degree p-modes
              characterization, low-frequency g-mode detection, solar structure and dynamics,
              mode excitation and damping, and theoretical advances in local helioseismology.
