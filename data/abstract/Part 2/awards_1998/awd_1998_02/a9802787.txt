Abstract    :
                AST 98-02787  Anatoly A. Klypin    The PI is using the Adaptive Refinement
              Tree (ART) code to address two problems in cosmology:  (1) the structure,
              dynamics and spatial distribution of dark matter halos, and (2) the physics of
              galaxy formation in different cosmological models.      The dark matter halos
              represent intermediate, but very important link between cosmological models,
              which deal with global parameters of the Universe and observations (e.g., power
              spectra of galaxies, different statistics of velocities of galaxies, rotational
              velocities of dark matter dominated galaxies).  Theoretical predictions are
              uncertain and inconsistent.  There is no consensus regarding projiles in the
              central parts (slope of the cusps).  The PI is carrying out extensive
              simulations that will resolve the issues and produce reliable results
              concerning structure and distribution of dark matter halos.    Theoretical
              predictions of formation of galaxies are still in their infant stage.  The PI
              is using realistic n-body + hydro simulations to test different physical
              mechanisms and assumptions in order to reduce those uncertainties.  He is
              studying such effects as the star formation feedback, the subresolution
              physics, the multiphase medium and the metal enrichment.    ***
