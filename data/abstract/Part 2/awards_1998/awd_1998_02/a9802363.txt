Abstract    :
              The project examines the role of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in
              high-elevation Andean forests during the 20th Century.  A multi-disciplinary
              approach based in quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to collect
              and interpret field and archived data on social and ecological processes.  The
              working hypotheses are threefold: (1) the relative roles of human and natural
              disturbances are reflected in the distribution, structure, and composition of
              forests; (2) individual forest patches have different levels of stability: and
              (3) local perceptions toward forests are variable and influential in forest
              use.  Contributions to the advancement of knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and
              human-environment interactions in the central Andean region will be made, as
              well as enhancements to the theoretical foundations of plant biogeography and
              environmental geography.  This is a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award.
