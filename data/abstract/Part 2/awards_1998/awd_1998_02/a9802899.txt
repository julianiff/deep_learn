Abstract    :
              9802899  Giles  This electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer will 
              allow the principal investigator to identify and  characterize device-limiting
              point defects in bulk and  epitaxial II-VI semiconductors.  EPR is a sensitive,
              high  resolution spectroscopic technique which is used to probe  the symmetry
              and electronic structure of point defects  through measurement of the g matrix
              and hyperfine  parameters.  Examples of point defects which can be studied  by
              EPR are acceptors, donors, vacancies, interstitials,  antisites, and
              transition-metal impurities.  Using a  commercial EPR spectrometer, the minimum
              detectable number  of spins is approximately 2 x 1010 at room temperature for a
               1 gauss linewidth.  The sensitivity is further improved by  cooling the sample
              to liquid helium temperatures.  This  ability to monitor small concentrations
              of point defects  makes EPR an excellent tool for use in research programs 
              that are developing the next generation of semiconductor  devices.  %%%  ***
