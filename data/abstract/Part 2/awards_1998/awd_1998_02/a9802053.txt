Abstract    :
              9802053  Gordin       This project is to support the GLOBE program objectives of
              using scientific visualization to connect the work of students and scientists
              and to help students study the Earth's environment as an integrated  system. 
              The visualizations  are for middle and high school students; emphasis at the
              middle school level is for manipulation of visualizing through their underlying
              data, thus helping student employ and learn algebra.  The high school
              activities use visualization to study global processes in each of GLOBE's four
              primary areas, atmosphere, hydrosphere, land use/biology and soil.  The
              enactment of these activities is aided by accompanying virtual social space
              where teachers, students, scientists, and educators can discuss and manipulate
              visualizations.  Materials are to be available in  multimedia, including paper,
              World Wide Web and CD-ROM.
