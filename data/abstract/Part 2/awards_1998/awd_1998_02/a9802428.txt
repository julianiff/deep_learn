Abstract    :
              9802428  McEwen    This Americas Program award will fund a two-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Bruce McEwen, Rockefeller  University, and Dr.
              Alejandro F. de Nicola, Instituto de  Biologia y Medicina Experimental, Buenos
              Aires, Argentina,  on  regulation and control of salt appetite.  Salt appetite 
              is associated with an important homeostatic, motivated  behavior, and serves as
              a model for studying appetites and  appetitive behaviors.  These studies will
              provide insights  into the neural basis of motivational states and behavior.   
              Using  state of the art techniques linking molecular biology  and classical
              physiological approaches, the colaborators  will focus on the amygdala as  an
              important target area for  mineralocorticoid induction of salt appetite.  In
              situ  hybridization histochemistry will be utilized to further  investigate the
              role of  adrenal steroid receptors.  The  project will address important,
              unanswered questions on the  fundamental function of the brain in the
              regulation of fluid  metabolism.    This collaboration will combine the
              expertise of the US side  in neurosciences and molecular biology, with the
              expertise  of the Argentinean side in  in physiology, pharmacology and 
              neuroendocrinology.  ***
