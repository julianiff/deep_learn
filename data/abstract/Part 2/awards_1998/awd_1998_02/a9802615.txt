Abstract    :
              This research program addresses the instability of natural and man-made slopes
              founded on colluvium.  (Colluvium consists of a mixture of residual and
              transported soils.)  When this material is part of a slope, the mixture is
              continually in a near-failure state because of constant downslope movement
              caused by gravity.  Since colluvium is a very common surficial deposit, this
              failure mode has important implications for the creation, operation, and/or
              expansion of the large number of natural and man-made slopes that are founded
              on this material.

Examples of such instability include the March 1996 slope
              failure of a 135-acre landfill in Ohio -- the largest slope failure ever in a
              municipal solid waste landfill -- and the upstream slope failure of the San
              Luis Dam in September 1981.

Based on these and other recent case histories,
              it appears that a drained residual shear strength can be mobilized in cohesive
              colluvial materials underlying natural and man-made slopes, with the adverse
              effect that a much flatter slope is required to design against failure.  This
              results in a smaller area for development in natural slopes and reduced
              airspace or capacity in landfills, either by limiting the expansion or
              requiring the expensive excavation of colluvium from the expansion area and/or
              from under the existing waste.

The project includes a study of field case
              histories and a combination of analytical and experimental techniques.  A goal
              of this project is to develop design recommendations for the
              construction/expansion of natural and man-made slopes founded on colluvium.
