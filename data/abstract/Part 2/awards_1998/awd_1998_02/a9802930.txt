This award provides partial support for the purchase of a matrix
              assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer
              (MALDI-TOF-MS).  This instrumentation is essential to many materials  research
              programs being undertaken on the University of California, Irvine campus which
              include programs in polymer science, material and synthetic chemistry, protein
              engineering, and disease research.  No MALDI-TOF-MS is available at UCI.  The
              chemistry department on this campus has rapidly expanded its faculty generating
              many more types of sample as well as increasing sample numbers.  The two
              magnetic sector systems now in the facility are fully committed providing high
              resolution data for organic synthesis.  The instrument will be used in a
              multi-user environment.  Projects in which the MALDI-TOF-MS is essential
              include: polyhomologation to form mixed hydrophilip/hydrophobic polymers and
              synthesis of organosiliconate monomers; research on incompletely condensed
              silsesquioxane cages and there use in surface reactivity models, hybrid
              inorganic/organic polymers and dendrimers; synthesis of photoluminescent and
              redox-active dendrimers and multimetallic compounds with potential applications
              in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices; lanthanide chemistry and the
              formation and understanding of the mechanisms of polymer formation as mediated
              by lanthanide complexes. Approximately 25 faculty, 140 graduate students, and
              50 postdoctorals will have access to this instrument.
