Abstract    :
                  Abstract  CTS-9802998  M.R. Zachariah, University of Arizona    An atomistic
              simulation method will be used in order to understand and predict coalescence
              and growth of aerosol  nanoscale particles.  Exemplification will be performed
              for two component systems and particularly for metal oxides ( silicon-dioxide
              and titaniym-dioxide).  This is an exploratory research for the application of
              the method to evaluate the fundamental thermodynamic properties of
              nanoparticles and particle formation mechanisms.  The simulated ratios of
              coalescence of two clusters will be compared to available phenomenological
              models for sintering kinetics.  A sensitivity analysis on the two-body
              potential parameters will be conducted in order to test the effect of the bond
              strenght, ionic and covalent components on the sintering mechanism.   
              Vapor-phase generation of metal-oxide nanoparticles has a multibillion-dollar
              production per year.  If successful, this research will provide improved
              fundamental understanding and a  predictive atomistic method for controlling
              the growth of the particle as a function of the thermophysical properties of
              the materials.
