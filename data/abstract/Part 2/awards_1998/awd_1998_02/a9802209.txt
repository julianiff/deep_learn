Abstract    :
              This project will utilize kinetic simulations to model wave turbulence in the
              auroral ionosphere.  The simulations are motivated by high resolution
              observations from the Freja and FAST satellites, as well as by sounding
              rockets.  Emphasis will be placed on the nonlinear evolution and saturation of
              two of the most commonly occurring wave modes:  lower-hybrid waves and Langmuir
              waves.  The simulations and the accompanying theoretical analysis will treat
              all phases of the evolution and saturation of  the turbulent waves.  To
              accomplish these goals, the simulations will be built upon existing computer
              codes developed under prior NSF support.
