Abstract    :
                Scientific planning will be undertaken regarding development  of a Global
              Ocean Observing System (GOOS).  The activities  are being led by the Joint
              Scientific Committee for GOOS (J  GOOS), co-sponsored by the International
              Council of  Scientific Unions (ICSU), the Intergovernmental  Oceanographic
              Commission (IOC), and the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO).  This
              effort focuses on preparation of  the final planning document to be entitled
              "GOOS 1998". This  report will address inter alia the scientific needs for 
              GOOS; the conceptual and engineering design for such a  system; preparation for
              pilot/demonstration projects;  recommendations for the construction and
              implementation of  the system; and recommendations for an infrastructure 
              intended to assure effective implementation, operation,  maintenance, and
              management of GOOS and of GOOS data.  This  effort will also take into account
              the need to assure an  effective transition from global change observing
              systems  now in place to the integrated GCOS/GOOS/Global Terrestrial  Observing
              System (GTOS) effort now being planned.      ***
