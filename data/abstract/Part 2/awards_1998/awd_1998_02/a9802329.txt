Abstract    :
              9802329  Goodman    Collagen, which forms a unique triple helical structure, is
              the  most abundant extracellular protein in vertebrates.  Collagen  possesses
              many favorable characteristics for biomaterials  development, including high
              tensile strength, low antigenicity,  low inflammatory and cytotoxic properties,
              and the ability to  promote cellular growth and cellular attachment.  The PI
              will  design a new class of collagen biomaterials, incorporating  dendrimeric
              structure, thereby creating defined macromolecular  domains for the collagen
              mimetics.  Several core structures have  been chosen to develop a diverse
              family of collagen-based  dendrimers, which can be further manipulated for
              specific  applications.  %%%  This project, supported by the Divisions of
              Materials Research  and Molecular & Cellular Biosciences and by the Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical  & Physical
              Sciences is in the area of biomaterials.  Collagen-  based biomaterials have
              broad potential biomedical applications,  including ocular devices, coatings
              and adhesives, biosensors,  implant materials and drug delivery systems.  The
              combination of  dendrimer and collagen properties represents an exciting 
              challenge to create novel biomaterials.  ***
