The
              project addresses some fundamental problems from symplectic geometry 
and
              Kaehler geometry.  The first part concerns the existence of 
Kaehler-Einstein
              metrics with positive scalar curvature.  These metrics 
provide solutions of
              the Einstein equation on Riemannian manifolds.  In 
the second part, the
              principal investigator (PI) intends to further study 
new invariants, often
              refered as GW-invariants, of general symplectic manifolds and find more
              applications to Hamiltonian systems, symplectic topology and geometry.  This
              part also contains very basic problem of understanding structure of
              GW-invariants and its possible relation to particular integrable systems. 
              
The PI also suggests to study some related nonlinear PDE problems which
              
arise from physics and geometry.

Problems in this project were motivated
              by our desire of probing 
mathematics of basic physical laws under suitable
              conditions.  For example, 
GW-invariants were inspired by a sigma model theory
              coupled with gravity in 
mathematical physics, and they extend classical
              enumerative geometry which 
involves counting curves through a number of
              points or intersections of 
curves.  The resolutions of these problems will
              provide new mathematical 
insights of Einstein equation in general relativity,
              quantum field theory, 
mirror symmetry phenomenon in string theory.  Our study
              will also deepen 
our understanding properties of symplectic manifolds,
              algebraic manifolds 
and Calabi-Yau spaces.
