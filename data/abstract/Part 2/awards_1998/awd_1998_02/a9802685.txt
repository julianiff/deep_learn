Abstract    :
              9802685  Lampert    In recent years, a number of researchers, designers, and
              practitioners around the country have been exploring the design and use of
              visual and multimedia technologies in support of the learning and study of
              teaching.  At the same time, teachers and teacher educators have been creating
              and using cases of practice as tools for teacher development.  It is not
              possible to expand the use of these materials to broader communities and
              audiences through communications technologies.  We propose that communications
              be established among the various interest groups by initiating communication
              around a set of identified problems and a set on examples of ongoing approaches
              to these problems to culminate in a workshop in early summer, 1998 at the
              University of Michigan.  A report will be produced from this workshop to guide
              the design, development, and use of multimedia and communications technologies
              for the study of teaching.
