Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics  will include analyses
              of possible Higgs particle signals at  future colliders, studies of the
              interactions between  photons and neutrinos in situations of astrophysical 
              interest, and investigations of the utility and validity of  `effective field
              theories` intended for the simplified  treatment of low-energy reactions.  The
              Higgs particles are  related to the genesis of mass, and their number, as well
              as  their relative masses and charges, must be determined in  order to fully
              understand the origin of mass and the  underlying symmetry of elementary
              particle theory.  Photons  and neutrinos only interact appreciably under
              extreme  conditions such as those found in the early universe or in  compact
              astrophysical objects.  It is important to determine  if this interaction
              alters our view of such things as the  relic neutrinos in cosmology or the way
              in which heavy  objects loose energy.  Since effective field theories  provide
              a convenient description of the low energy behavior  of many processes, it is
              essential to check them against  exact theories which are accurate at all
              energies.
