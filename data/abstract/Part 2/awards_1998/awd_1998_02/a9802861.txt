Abstract    :
                  9802861  Guilbault       This award provides partial support for a workshop
              in  geometric topology to be held in each of the summers of 1998, 1999,  and
              2000.  The 1998 workshop will be held in Park City, Utah, with  Brigham Young
              University acting as host, with Professor David G. Wright as  the local
              organizer, and with Professor Steven C. Ferry of SUNY-Binghamton  as the
              principal lecturer.  The 1999 workshop will be held at University  of
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the 2000 workshop will be held at Colorado  College. 
              These workshops belong to a well established series that began  in the 1980's. 
                   Geometric topology treats the structure and properties of low- 
              dimensional topological manifolds.  Previous workshops in this series  have
              focused on such major developments in the field as the solution of  the
              knot-complement problem by Andrew Casson and John Luecke.  The  principal
              lectures on that occasion (1989) were given by Luecke, whose  solution
              confirmed the conjecture that a knot in 3-dimensional space is  completely
              determined by its complement (the residual space  remaining after a worm has
              eaten its way along the knot, leaving a knot-  shaped tunnel behind).  The
              workshops' primary goal is to provide  mathematicians with active research
              programs but limited support an  opportunity to discuss their work with others
              in the field.  Another  important goal is to expand the interests of the
              participants by having  a nationally recognized expert discuss an area that is
              related to, but  outside, the focus of their current work.  A third goal is to
              provide a  serious but informal research atmosphere in which gradate students
              in  geometric topology can meet and learn from others in the field.  ***
