This award provides partial support for the acquisition of
              equipment to provide Rice University researchers with a state-of-the-art
              ultrahigh vacuum, variable-temperature scanning tunneling/atomic force
              microscope instrument.  This instrument will address the needs for nanoscale
              imaging, localized spectroscopy, and single molecule device fabrication and
              transport measurement capabilities for a cluster of faculty members in the
              Physics, Chemistry, and Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments.  A
              primary focus for this instrument is the study of fullerene nanotubes in a
              range of scientific and technological contexts.  

The system will allow the
              following research activities:

1)  imaging and spectroscopy of fullerene
              nanotubes and other nanoparticles of interest, 
2)  assembly of
              single-molecule and nanoparticle-based device structures, 
3) 
              characterization of hybrid e-beam lithography/molecular self-assembly device
              fabrication methods, 
4)  fabrication, characterization, and imaging
              applications of fullerene STM tips: C60- adsorbed STM tips,       and fullerene
              nanotube AFM/STM tips,
5)  structural imaging and spectroscopic investigations
              of functionalized fullerene nanotubes and nanotube           defects using
              C60-adsorbed STM tips,
6)  temperature-dependent nanoscale imaging and
              analysis of the phase transitions and structural       transformations in
              nanosized polymers. 

This instrument will be the only ultrahigh vacuum or
              variable temperature STM/AFM instrument at Rice University.  It will therefore
              provide significant new experimental capabilities, enhancing the ongoing
              programs of several research groups as well as providing a state-of-the-art
              nanoscale facility for junior faculty with growing research programs.
