Abstract    :
              9802424  Tonks        The FASEB conference on Protein Phosphatases will be held
              this  summer.  It is the fifth conference on this topic supported by  FASEB. 
              Research on protein phosphatases is proceeding at a rapid  pace, revealing the
              fundamental importance and unexpected  complexity of these enzymes in the
              signal transduction pathways  that govern the fundamental aspects of cell
              physiology.  Within  the past two years, dozens of new phosphatases and
              phosphatase  regulatory subunits have been identified.  A major focus of the 
              current research is to understand the functions of this diverse  array of
              phosphatases and the multiplicity of ways they are  involved in signaling. 
              This conference will serve as a forum for  dissemination of the most recent
              information on the structure,  function and  regulation of this important class
              of regulatory molecules.  This  meeting will select participants from
              applicants including  scientists from industry as well as academia. 
              Participants will include senior scientists, postdoctoral fellows  and graduate
              students.  Some of the speakers will be selected from  investigators who have
              recently made important contributions and  from submitted abstracts.  Poster
              sessions are also included.  This meeting is valuable to scientists working in
              this field.  ***
