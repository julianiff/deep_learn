Abstract    :
              The American Geophysical Union is sponsoring another Chapman Conference in July,
              1998.  This conference centers on magnetic helicity in space and laboratory
              plasmas, bringing a broad spectrum of theorists and experimenters in laboratory
              plasmas, interplanetary space, the Sun and other stars, and the galaxy.  The
              conference will, however, primarily focus on solar and solar-related questions.
