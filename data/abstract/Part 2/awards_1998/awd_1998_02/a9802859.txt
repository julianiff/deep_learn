     This project studies problems related to polynomial
              invariants in knot
theory, particularly for the Jones polynomial and its
              generalizations via
methods in statistical mechanics, quantum groups and
              quantum field theory.
A central problem about the Jones polynomial is whether
              its triviality
implies the triviality of the knot to which it is applied.  An
              affirmative
answer to this question would constitute a breakthrough in
              our
understanding of the nature of knottedness in three-dimensional
              space.
Mathematical ideas motivated by physical ideas have succeeded in
              producing
a medley of invariants of knots, links, and three-manifolds. 
              The
investigator is in the process of extending these ideas to knotted
              surfaces
in four-dimensional space and to four-dimensional manifolds.  Here
              the
discovery of new invariants would itself constitute a breakthrough in
              the
study of four dimensions.  Such a breakthrough would have implications
              for
the physics of quantum gravity.
     The mathematical study of knots is
              important not only for its own
sake, but also for its applications to
              molecular biology and its
relationships with physics and the foundations of
              mathematics.  The
research indicated in this project is linked with these
              applications and
with the use of both computer graphics and expository writing
              to enlarge
the discussion of these ideas in both interdisciplinary and
              educational
contexts.  By using computer models of knots, one can study
              questions such
as how the knot will behave if it is coated with electrical
              charge
(self-repelling knots), how it will appear if it is tied with a
              least
amount of rope for a given diameter, how the geometry of the
              complement
of the knot appears to an observer flying about in it, how DNA
              molecules
behave when moving in their cellular environment.  All these
              directly
physical questions are, at levels that we do not yet fully
              understand,
related to the more algebraic methods of the polynomial
              invariants.
Knots and Nature are inextricably entwined.
