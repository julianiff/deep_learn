Abstract    :
                  AST-9802963  Windhorst    Dr. Windhorst and colleagues will prepare for a
              study of the evolution and formation of faint field and radio galaxies by
              purchasing and characterizing a specially designed set of 15 medium band
              filters.  These filters are designed to cover most of the optical spectrum
              between night sky lines and allow precise and accurate spectrophotometry.  With
              this filter set in place, they will be well prepared to carry out an extensive
              deep imaging survey of several well studied fields that will allow them to find
              and characterize the evolution of distant objects over a large redshift range.
