Abstract    :
              9802449  Misra    This award supports a conference on "Representations of Affine
              and Quantum Affine Algebras and Their Applications" at North Carolina State
              University.  This conference aims to bring together experts working in
              different aspects of affine Lie algebras and quantum affine algebras as well as
              their applications.  The participants will involve senior, mid-level and junior
              researchers working in this area.  Special efforts will be made to assure that
              the list of participants is diverse.    This conference is concerned with a
              mathematical object called a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another
              object called a Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and Lie algebras
              are important in areas involving analysis of sperical motion.
