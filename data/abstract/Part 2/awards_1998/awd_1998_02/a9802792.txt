Abstract    :
              9802792  Umhoefer  Strain and deformation partitioning at oblique convergent
              plate margins was proposed twenty-five years ago, and subsequently has been
              identified  in the arcs of many subduction zones.  Whether or not deformation
              is partitioned in divergent plate margins is still an open question, let alone
              how the deformation might be partitioned.  The project will be one of the first
              to critically explore this question. It focuses on Baja California Sur, in
              Mexico, as one of the best examples of an oblique divergent plate boundary,
              with one of the largest obliquities.  If this study is successful, it will
              determine the rates of modern displacement of faults in the region, determine
              the average rates of displacement for the same structures over the last few
              million years, and ultimately establish what role the strain partitioning  has
              in these strike-slip displacements.
