Abstract    :
                      9802286  Zeigler       The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and
              Science proposed to develop an outreach science and mathematics program with a
              parent involvement and teacher enhancement professional development component. 
              The goals of the project are as follows:  (1) to involve parents in their
              children's education;  (2) to promote a positive attitude on behalf of parents
              and students toward science and mathematics; (3) to increase teachers' level of
              comfort in teaching science; and (4) to enhance teacher's confidence in the
              hands-on approach as an effective method for teaching science.       The
              objectives for the parent component of this project are: acquaint parents with
              the national and state science education goals and standards; introduce parents
              to activities that can be done at home with children; and provide families with
              materials and activity sheets that can be used at home.  The objectives for the
              teacher component of this project are: (1) to provide teachers with
              opportunities for increased communication with parents about science literacy
              for children; (2) provide professional development for teachers on the use of
              hands-on science activities in the classroom; and (3) to providing bilingual
              activity guides and kits containing materials to encourage science learning.   
               The methods for implementing this project will be varied according to the
              needs of the target audiences.  Parents and children will be engaged through
              parent workshops and multi-aged children's activities conducted at the museum
              by experienced science educators.  The professional development for teachers'
              component of this project will include an extensive summer workshop, on-going
              training/ planning sessions during the school calendar year and session on the
              uses of the bilingual teaching manuals.     The cost sharing for this NSF award
              is 46.7% of the total project cost.
