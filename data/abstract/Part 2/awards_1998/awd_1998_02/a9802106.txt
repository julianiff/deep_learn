This proposal intends to advance funamental research in
              reduction
theory for mechanical systems with symmetry in the following
              ways.
First, the theory of reduction by stages for group extensions will
              be
developed in both the Hamiltonian (cotangent, symplectic and
              Poisson
contexts) and the Lagrangian (variational context) points of
              view.
Second, the geometry and dynamics of Lagrangian reduction,
              especially
the Lagrange-Poincare equations and the
              Lagrange-d'Alembert-Poincare
equations will be investigated. In addition, the
              theory of geometric
phases for systems reduced using invariants and Kahler
              structures as
well as the use of blowing up techniques in singular reduction,
              and
multisymplectic geometry will be advanced.

The engineering analysis of
              mechanical systems such as robotic
locomotion and control devices makes use of
              the proposers mathematical
techniques in geometric mechanics. This
              mathematical foundation will
be of increased importance as the sophistication
              of such engineering
systems get more complex and exhibit more exotic dynamical
              behaviors
and require more delicate control strategies. The topics in
              this
proposal are critical enabling tools for such research and have
              proven
to be of great utility in a variety of systems such as
              satellite
stabilization and underwater vehicle dynamics. They are also being
              put
to fundamental use in numerical simulation packages for
              nonlinear
dynamical systems in mechanics, including collision, fluid,
              and
elastic systems as well as in satellite mission planning.
