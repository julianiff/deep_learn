Abstract    :
                9802586  Orr    This project seeks to advance understanding of the relative
              role  of kinetics and thermodynamics in GaAs MBE. The approach involves  a
              combination of experiment and theory to study dynamic processes  on clean GaAs
              surfaces such as the interactions between surface-  mobile Ga adatoms and As
              desorption. Experiments include static  annealing to probe As desorption and
              free Ga dynamics, step  energy measurements under conditions of As or Ga
              termination, and  step instability studies. Data obtained is expected to help 
              reveal the relative importance between kinetic processes and  equilibrium
              thermal fluctuations during film growth.  %%%  The project addresses basic
              research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high
              technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic 
              devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level
              observation of basic surface processes which when better  understood will allow
              advances in both fundamental and  technological arenas. The basic knowledge and
              understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving 
              the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is
              the integration of research  and education through the training of students in
              a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***
