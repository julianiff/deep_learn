Abstract    :
              AST-9802791  Becker    Dr. Becker and Dr. Helfand are collaborating  to use the
              FIRST database.  The FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-one cm)
              survey covered 5000 square degrees of the northern sky.  The FIRST data are
              publicly available as are the image database and source catalogs.  The FIRST
              project provides to users a sophisticated catalog search engine and image
              cutout server.  Nearly a quarter of a million hits to the database have been
              recorded since 1994.  The FIRST catalog is now the largest catalog in the NASA
              Extragalactic Database.    The team is undertaking four projects: (1) study of
              weak gravitational lensing, the angular correlation function, and the angular
              size-redshift distribution for double radio sources, (2) study of bent double
              radio sources as tracers, (3) a bright quasar survey along with BL Lacs, red
              quasars and gravitational lenses, (4) a study of radio stars and rapidly
              variable radio sources.  These projects exploit the sensitivity, morphological
              fidelity and astrometric accuracy of the FIRST survey.  The PI's are adding
              over 2000 quasars, 300 BL Lacs, and at least 10 lens systems during the course
              of the project.  Bent-double radio galaxies derived from the FIRST survey can
              be used to select clusters with the efficiency to redshifts of 0.85 and beyond.
               Since the distorted radio lobes in these systems guarantee that the clusters
              contain a dense ICM, their sample is critical to understanding the evolution of
              the x-ray luminosity function in clusters.  The PI's are also using the data
              from the FIRST catalog as a set of background images for which weak lensing
              effects of the total foreground mass distribution (dark matter plus light)
              reveals the true nature of large-scale structure on scales of 0.5 to 10
              degrees.  ***
