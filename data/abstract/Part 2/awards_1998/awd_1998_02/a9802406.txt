Abstract    :
              9802426  Daskalopoulos    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative
              study  in certain non-linear parabolic equations in differential  geometry
              between Dr. Panagiota Daskalopolous, University of  California, Irvine, and Dr.
              Manuel del Pino, University of  Chile.  The main objectives of the proposal are
              concerned  with the study of the structure and the new features of  certain
              nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations arising in  different geometry and
              physical applications.  The study  will include investigation of  several
              aspects of the  subject, including super-diffusive nonlinear parabolic 
              problems, the vanishing profile of fast-diffusions, and the  free-boundary for
              the porous medium equation with prescribed  boundary conditions.    The
              researchers' main interest is in understanding the  similarities and
              differences between the case of slow  diffusion, and the cases of fast
              diffusion because of their  connection to differential geometry  and their
              occurrence in  a number of physical applications, including thin liquid  film
              dynamics and the expansion of a thermalized electron  cloud.  ***
