Abstract    :
              This project studies the working poor, the people employed at the bottom of the
              labor market who share the neighborhoods, social institutions and families as
              AFDC recipients faced with welfare reform.  By using a combination of survey
              and ethnographic methods the project will tell us what changes in the welfare
              system have meant to people's lives.  The investigators will return to a sample
              of 100 working poor families in New York city, originally studied in 1995, and
              convert them into a longitudinal panel by tracking the households for a total
              of six years, spanning the `before` and `after` of welfare reform.  Five
              families in each of two neighborhoods, one mainly African American in Harlem
              and one ethnically heterogeneous in Washington Heights will be studied by
              intensive ongoing participant observation fieldwork. The researchers will also
              interview community leaders, school officials, church leaders, police and fire
              officials, and other experts with long-standing ties to the neighborhoods.  The
              study will focus on features of neighborhoods and social networks which promote
              social stability, how access to employment information, social support,
              adolescent monitoring and informal child care change as the welfare system
              changes; how family and friendship networks function in the changing situation;
              how transnational linkages cushion the effects of welfare reform; and how
              people understand and interpret the changing circumstances of their lives.
