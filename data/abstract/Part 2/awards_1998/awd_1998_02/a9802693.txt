Abstract    :
              Ramakrishnan  9802693    This is a 12-month award proposed by Drs. V.
              Ramarkrishnan,  South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and Professor  D.
              Badarch, Mongolian Technical University.  Dr. Ramarkrishnan requests funds for
              10 U.S. scientists to  travel to Mongolia to attend a joint U.S. and Mongolia 
              bilateral workshop on high performance concrete for  construction and/or
              rehabilitation of transportation  structures on August 24-27, 1998.  The
              purpose of this  workshop is to discuss the issues related to high  performance
              concrete application and the repair,  retrofitting, and renovation of high
              performance concrete.  The proposed participants are leaders in this area of 
              research.  This is a fast developing engineering field and  has a major impact
              on transportation infrastructures and the  construction industry.  The
              challenging environmental  conditions in Mongolia offer unique opportunities
              for U.S.  scientists to test and develop high performance concrete  products. 
              At the same time, this workshop can bring to  Mongolia the latest available
              technology for building  urgently needed transportation infrastructure.
