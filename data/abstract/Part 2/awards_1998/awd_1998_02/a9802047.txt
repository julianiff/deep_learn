This work will theoretically and
              experimentally study the transport phenomena related to the use of intense
              localized sources of heat to augment conventional machining of
              difficult-to-machine materials, such as ceramics and superalloys.  Thermally
              assisted machining (TAM) integrating intense laser sources will be applied to
              materials such as zirconia and titanium alloys.  Theoretical treatments of TAM
              processes will be used to determine the role of pertinent transport phenomena
              on thermal conditions in proximity to regions of material removal.  Models will
              consider net radiation and convection transfer from the workpiece surface,
              conduction and radiation emission, absorption and scattering within the
              workpiece, friction at the tool-chip interface and energy generation due to
              material removal by plastic deformation.  Supporting experiments will be
              performed to validate the models and to characterize the surface and
              sub-surface conditions of the machined specimen.  The overall objectives of the
              work are to obtain an improved understanding of the underlying physical
              mechanisms for TAM processes and to establish a range of suitable operating
              conditions.
