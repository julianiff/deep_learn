The goal of this research is to develop, via perturbation
              methods, new expressions for error statistics associated with point-based rigid
              registration in medical imaging, with emphasis on target registration where the
              targets are typical "targets" of surgery.  A specific motivation is that
              knowledge of these errors is crucial in the planning and guidance of surgery,
              especially brain surgery.  The numerical methods to estimate these errors are
              extremely unwieldy and time consuming and if reliable closed form
              approximations were available they could substantially advance the utility of
              image guided surgery, among other applications of imaging.
