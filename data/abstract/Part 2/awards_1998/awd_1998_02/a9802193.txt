Abstract    :
                AST-9802193  Hunter    Irregular galaxies are the most common type of galaxy
              in the Universe.  Because they have evolved relatively slowly over time, they
              chemically resemble the outer parts of present day spirals and young galaxies
              seen at large look-back times.  Unlike spirals, however, irregulars have no
              density waves and less shear in their interstellar media. Yet, most irregulars
              have on-going star formation.  Therefore, non-interacting irregular galaxies
              give us the opportunity to examine processes of star formation in the absence
              of spiral density waves and external perturbations.  These processes may play
              an important role in spiral galaxies too, but there they are masked by the
              consequences of the density wave.    Dr. Hunter is collaborating with Dr.
              Elmegreen to answer the question: What regulates the star formation activity in
              irregular galaxies on global and local scales?  They are proceeding (1) to
              quantify the nature and distribution of the star formation activity, (2) to
              characterize the interstellar medium out of which clouds and stars form, and
              (3) to combine the observations with models to develop a realistic picture for
              the onset of star formation in these systems.      The observations probe star
              formation on three timescales: H a images trace the most recent star formation,
              UBV images integrate the star formation over the past Gyr, and JHK images
              integrate the star formation over the lifetime of the galaxy.  To characterize
              the interstellar medium, the team is using radio interferometer maps of HI line
              emission and absorption.  ***
