Abstract    :
              9802086  Montgomery    This award supports work on Hopf algebras and related
              structures.  The principal investigator will compare the prime ideals of a Hopf
              crossed product with the prime ideals of the underlying algebra on which the
              Hopf algebra acts.  More generally, she will compare the primes in a Hopf
              Galois extension.  She will also study "duality problems" involving both the
              action of a Hopf algebra and of a suitable dual Hopf algebra, in order to look
              at the prime ideals for infinite dimensional Hopf algebras.  Problems on
              classifying finite-dimensional Hopf algebras will also be considered in the
              context of Yetter-Drinfeld categories.  Finally some problems concerning
              algebras graded by groups will be considered.    This research is concerned
              with an algebraic object called a Hopf algebra.  While the area is quite
              technical, Hopf algebras are becoming of increasing interest, even to
              nonmathematicians.  Hopf algebras are useful for studying the type of knot
              theory that appears in molecular chemistry.  Certain types of Hopf algebras are
              now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of the applications in
              physics.  Hopf algebras are used to study differential operators and to make
              combinatorics more like calculus.
