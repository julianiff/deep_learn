Abstract    :
              Taylor
The calculation of individual eigenstates and resonances using
              semiclassical dynamics is a highly non-trivial problem.  The present research
              examines some new high resolution spectral analyzers which enable the
              extraction of these eigenvalues from a recurrence function of finite length. 
              The method has broad generality and appears to be useful for other problems
              such as signal processing where short time sampling limits conventional Fourier
              approaches.
