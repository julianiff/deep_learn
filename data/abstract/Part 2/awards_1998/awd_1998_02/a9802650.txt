Abstract    :
              9802650   Stone      The Educational Development Center, Inc. is planning a
              national leadership development program for community-based technology
              education programs targeted to underserved populations.  The Leadership
              Institute, which will be developed by the CTCNet Project housed at EDC, will
              prepare center developers, directors and related program administrators to plan
              and implement sustainable and effective programs in a wide variety of settings.
               Such training will expedite start-up for new centers and build capacity for
              existing centers, and it will help address the increasing demand for effective
              staff who can respond to the rapid spread of community-based access to
              computers and the Internet.       During the planning phase and building on
              preliminary work already performed, CTCNet will:    * Conduct a thorough market
              assessment and definition, accompanied by development of a marketing strategy 
              * Develop content for the Institute   * Prepare plans for evaluating the
              Institute  * Arrange logistics for conducting the first session of the
              Institute  * EDC will conduct a pilot version of the Institute in the New
              England area with ten participants    If the market research indicates that
              paid participation by people in the field will not support further Institutes,
              EDC will implement a dedicated funding effort to support the Institute on an
              ongoing basis.
