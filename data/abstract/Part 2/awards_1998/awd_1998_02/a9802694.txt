This three-year award involves research on novel methods
              for distance-learning in process control in collaboration with ARIADNE
              (Alliance for Remote Instructional Authoring and Distribution Networks for
              Europe), which is jointly sponsored by the European Economic Commission and the
              Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science.  The collaboration involves
              Oscar Crisalle and a graduate student from the University of Florida and
              researchers located at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne,
              the University of Grenoble and the University of Genoa.  The objectives of the
              research are the development and evaluation of hardware and software tools that
              allow science and engineering students located in remote sites to learn process
              control concepts and access physical experimental systems over the
              Internet.
