Abstract    :
              HRD-9802223  Jacquez    The New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP)
              seeks to increase the size  of the pool of interested and academically
              qualified minority students eligible for  graduate study in science,
              mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) fields.   New Mexico AMP will
              achieve this goal by increasing the quantity and quality of  students receiving
              baccalaureate degrees in SMET disciplines from 235 annually in  1992/93
              annually by 2002/2003.    During the first four years of the program, New
              Mexico AMP laid the foundation for  exciting new opportunities that will
              strengthen the pipeline leading to baccalaureate  degrees and graduate study. 
              National Science Foundation (NSF) support for Phase II  of the New Mexico AMP
              will allow us to:  1) expand curricular reforms; 2) integrate  and
              institutionalize programmatic components; 3) disseminate results; and 4) extend
               evaluation into the policy-making process.    Among the innovative features of
              Phase II are novel plans for tiered peer mentoring  and increased undergraduate
              research opportunities through internships and  assistantships.  New
              collaboration and synergy with related initiatives and industry  will fuel
              these endeavors.  New Mexico educational and political leaders are deeply 
              committed to fostering excellence in undergraduate education and increasing 
              opportunities for minority participation in SMET professions.  NSF s support
              for  Phase II will play a vital role in setting new directions that will build
              on the good  work that has been achieve during the first phase of this
              important program.
