Abstract
--------

               We
              propose to extend work on variational bounds for bulk
dissipation in boundary
              driven Navier-Stokes turbulence, with particular
attention to Rayleigh-Benard
              convection. We intend to investigate 
the effect of rotation and of change in
              Prandtl number on high Rayleigh
number turbulence. We propose to investigate
              analytically and numerically
the scaling of generalized structure functions in
              Navier-Stokes turbulence 
and compare the results with those of simple
              stochastic models. We propose 
to study analytically and numerically the
              formation of singularities
and dynamics of compressible dissipative active
              scalars and of 
quasi-geostrophic incompressible active scalars. We also
              propose to 
investigate models of granular dynamics and their relation to
              
experimental data. 
    
    
           The present proposal is aimed at
              the understanding
of nonlinear phenomena in fluids. Understanding these
              phenomena is essential
to areas that range from weather prediction, climate
              and environmental 
studies, turbulent combustion (as for instance in engines)
              to the 
cosmological question of mass distribution in the universe. The
              objects of 
study in this proposal represent areas that challenge or lie
              beyond 
the capabilities of the most powerful computing systems 
available
              today; the proposal aim is to develop physical mathematics
theory and
              numerical models that will yield progress in our ability 
to perform computer
              simulations.
