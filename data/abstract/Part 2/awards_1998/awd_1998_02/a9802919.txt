Abstract    :
              The numerical solution of large sparse linear algebraic equations
represents a
              very significant portion of scientific computing.
Such linear systems arise
              from the discretization of partial
differential equations as well as in many
              other contexts, such as
the numerical solution of nonlinear equations and
              optimization
problems. Over the past two decades, significant progress
              has
been made in the development and analysis of iterative Krylov
subspace
              methods.  This project will address a number of theoretical
and practical
              issues associated with the use of Krylov space
methods for solving linear
              systems.

One of the large remaining open problems in this field is the
              
development of a clear method of choice for nonsymmetric problems.
Analysis
              of nonsymmetric Krylov space methods will be a component
of this project.  It
              is also important to understand the effect of
rounding errors on the
              performance of both symmetric and nonsymmetric
iterative methods and this
              topic will also be addressed.  Finally,
from a practical point of view, it is
              most often the preconditioner
that has the greatest effect on the performance
              of an iterative 
method.  Ideas developed in this research will be applied in
              
problems involving neutron transport and ground-water flow simulation
to
              test their practicality.  Parallelism will be a consideration
in all of the
              work.
