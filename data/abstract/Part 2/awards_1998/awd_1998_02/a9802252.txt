              support for processing proposals received in the Division of Environmental
              Biology's Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant Competition.  Activities
              include initial data-entry, panel mail-out, and decline data-entry/jacket
              preparation for proposal received by the 10 October 1997 deadlines.  Initial
              data entry will include assembly of file jackets, entry of data into the NSF
              mailing of appropriate proposals, review forms, panel information, and other
              pertinent documents to panelists.  Decline data-entry/jacket preparation will
              include entering decline data into the NSF mainframe, generating decline
              letter/labels and assembling decline jacket and PI packages.
