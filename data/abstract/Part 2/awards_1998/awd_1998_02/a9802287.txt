Abstract    :
              The objective of this research program is to develop a computationally efficient
              mathematical model for analyzing the permanent deformation of saturated soil
              structures during and following an earthquake.  This is a group research
              project involving principal investigators at the University of California-Davis
              and George Washington University.

The model is based on a finite deformation
              two-phase mixture theory.  It involves the improvement and implementation of an
              already-validated plasticity constitutive model into an existing finite element
              code.  The goal is to enhance the capability of this code to accurately predict
              the behavior of saturated soils prior to and during liquefaction.  The
              constitutive model is being extended to represent the behavior of granular
              soils, both at moderately high and at very low effective stresses, making it
              possible to simulate the behavior of soil prior to and during liquefaction. 
              This is achieved by considering the change of soil fabric as the soil
              approaches very low effective stresses.  The resulting finite-element model is
              used to study the mechanism of liquefaction-related large ground displacements,
              including the lateral spreading and settlement of saturated soil
              deposits.

Advancing the ability to predict the lateral spreading of soil
              foundations following strong ground shaking will be a significant contribution
              to mitigating the effects of earthquakes.
