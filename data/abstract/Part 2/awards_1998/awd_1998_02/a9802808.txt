Abstract    :
              9802808  Hsia        The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.      This award will support an eighteen-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Tain-Yen Hsia to work with Dr. Marc R.  de
              Leval at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in  London, England.    
               Dr. Hsia's work involves the application of engineering  principles to medical
              problem solving, in particular, the  computational fluid dynamics as applied to
              cardiovascular  physiology.  For this project, he will apply computational 
              methodology to obtain quantitative solutions of the three-  dimensional flow
              characteristics in the hypoplastic left  heart syndrome.  This study will
              provide the groundwork for  engineering methods in the treatment of any
              congenital heart  disease.      The Great Ormond Street Hospital is the only
              place equipped  with the clinical experience and engineering expertise 
              required for this study.  Dr. de Leval has gathered data for  this work and has
              perfected the modeling.  The engineering  facility, in collaboration with Dr.
              F. Migliavacca of  Politecnico de Milano in Italy, has been designed to provide
               a seamless operation of the numerical simulations.  Dr. de  Leval is an
              internationally known expert in the repair of  congenital heart defects and has
              led a team of international  experts using sophisticated engineering principles
              to  examine the fluid dynamics in complex congenital heart  defects and those
              same defects after repair.      ***
