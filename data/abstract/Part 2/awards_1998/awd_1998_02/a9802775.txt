This Americas Program award will fund a three-year
              cooperative research project between Drs Krishnan Rajeshwar and Norma de
              Tacconi, University of Texas, Arlington (UTA),  and Dr. R. O. Lenza, and a
              group of researchers from the Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoquimicas
              Teoricas y Aplicadas (INIFTA), Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, to
              develop and characterize new  families of electrochromic (EC) and
              photoelectrochromic (PEC) thin films. These are thin films that change their
              optical absorbance or reflectance in response to an electrical or
              electrochemical impulse. Particular attention will be paid to the optimization
              of experimental variables to bring about good reversibility, fast time response
              and long-term stability to these new generation devices.    The mechanistics
              aspects associated with the color changes will be monitored in situ by
              electronic and vibrational spectroscopies as well as by conventional
              electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques.  The coatings have many
              potential applications including  smart windows, displays, and mirrors.

The
              research  profits from the complementary expertise of the collaborators, as
              well as by the facilities at  both institutions.  The
              electrochemical-photoelectrochemical quartz crystal microgavimetry methods will
              be done at UTA, while the spectroscopic methods will take place at 
              INIFTA.
