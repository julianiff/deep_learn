Abstract    :
              AST 98-02994  Mathews    The PI is studying the nature and evolution of hot gas
              in elliptical galaxies.  In recent years the quality of extragalactic x-ray
              observations has been steadily increasing and is expected to undergo another
              unprecedented multiplication in sensitivity and precision with the launching of
              the AXAF satellite next year.  The spatial scale of AXAF are ideally suited for
              observations of hot gas in ellipticals.  Ellipticals are not only the brightest
              x-ray galaxies, they also create enormous displays of radio emission and harbor
              massive black holes in their centers.  Most massive ellipticals and their
              component stars are thought to be very old, formed by the merging of young
              galaxies in the early history of the universe.  The PI has found evidence that
              most of the hot interstellar gas in bright ellipticals is also very old and is
              circumgalactic, occupying the outermost regions of the dark halos far beyond
              most of the galactic stars.      The program  begins with one dimensional
              numerical gas dynamic studies seeking a self consistent origin of the very old,
              very hot circumgalactic gas.  Evidently, the circumgalactic gas first
              accumulated in the same cosmological inflow that formed the young elliptical. 
              This gas may also be heated and enriched with heavy elements by supernovae of
              massive first generation stars.  The effects of galactic rotation, tidal
              exchange of hot gas between galaxies, etc. will be added as the project
              progresses.  These additions involve two or three spatial dimensions.  ***
