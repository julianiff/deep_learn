              and Claude LeBrun


Anderson and LeBrun will explore new relations between
              the geometries 
and topologies of low-dimensional manifolds.  The main theme
              of this 
research is the relation between the scalar curvature functional and
              
manifold topology.  In dimension 3, Anderson will continue his program 
to
              prove Thurston's geometrization conjectures from this point of 
view, and
              study relations between this and Einstein metrics on 
4-manifolds.  In
              dimension 4, LeBrun will study relations between the 
scalar curvature
              functional, Weyl curvature, Seiberg-Witten theory, 
and the existence of
              Einstein metrics.  LeBrun will also work on 
related problems in higher
              dimensions.

The scalar curvature functional was introduced by Einstein and
              
Hilbert, and plays a fundamental role in Einstein's theory of General
              
Relativity.  Anderson's investigations have a direct bearing on 
questions
              regarding the physics of black holes and the shape of the 
universe.  In a
              similar way, LeBrun's work studies fundamental 
questions arising from
              Hawking's quantum gravity program, and ties the 
Seiberg-Witten equations of
              high energy physics to the study of 
gravitational phenomena.
