Abstract    :
              ***  9802469  This grant will support the development of a novel set of 
              laboratory modules for undergraduate physics laboratories.  The modules will
              emphasize several aspects of biophysics,  showing how physical principles are
              realized in biological  systems.  They include: tracking of diffusing particles
              in  solution; the forces on organelles; visual processing by the  fly.  Those
              interested in learning about these modules, for  use in other schools, can
              attend a hands-on workshop at the  host institution.  ***
