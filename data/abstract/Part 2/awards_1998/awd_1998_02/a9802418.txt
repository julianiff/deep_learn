              "CONFERENCE:  Molecular Diversity of Ion Channels and                          
              Receptors"                                                       Bernardo Rudy,
              P.I.    This proposal is for an international conference on the  diversity of
              form and function found among complex molecules  of the membrane of living
              nerve cells.  The molecules of  interest are of two sorts:   "Ion channels"
              allow charged  small molecules such as sodium, potassium and calcium ions  to
              pass into and out of the nerve cells.   "Receptors" react  to signal molecules
              (neurotransmitters) released by other  nerve cells to communicate the signal to
              the interior of the  cell.   Together, these molecules are responsible for some
               of the key steps in the processing and storage of  information and the
              regulation of behavior by the nervous  system.  The program will bring together
              eminent scholars  and junior scientists with overlapping interests in a very 
              dynamic field of study.  The goal is to examine and share  new technical
              advances in the area and to consider the  conceptual foundations of ion channel
              biophysics and  physiology.  These goals are central to our progressively 
              better understanding of the brain.
