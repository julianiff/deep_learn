              Infrastructure: CAVERN: The CAVE Research

UIC's research goal is to move
              Tele-Immersion and Data Mining from the laboratory to the Next Generation
              Internet.  Scientists are just now beginning to get access to high-speed
              networks to retrieve information from remote datasets (whether large disk
              farms, scientific instrumentation, or satellites), analyze that information
              using remote supercomputers, and use virtual reality (VR) to collaborate with
              distant colleagues.  UIC has promoted VR and data mining in select communities
              of users, and now wishes to create the teams, tools, hardware, system software,
              and human-interface models to enable national-scale, multi-site collaborations
              to facilitate solutions to National Challenge and Grand Challenge
              problems.

Planned CAVE Research Network (CAVERN) activities are twofold:
              enabling technology development and application driver support.  This proposal
              lays out several application disciplines- - computational science and
              engineering, education and training, and every citizen interfaces (ECI) with
              emphasis on rehabilitation for the disabled - - to drive the development of the
              tools and techniques for tele-immersion and data mining.  Enabling technologies
              for tele-immersion and data mining include CAVERNsoft, ECI interfaces, data
              mining tools, video, and performance optimization.
