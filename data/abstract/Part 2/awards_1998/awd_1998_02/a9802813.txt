Abstract    :
              9802813  Fendley  Nonperturbative methods are valuable for exploring the large 
              number of interesting systems with strong coupling in  condensed matter
              physics.  Experimental advances have  allowed extensive scrutiny of systems
              like the quantum Hall  effect, quantum impurities and spin chains where these
              new  techniques are immediately applicable.  Many of these  systems exhibit
              fully non-Fermi-liquid behavior, meaning  that one usually cannot even
              formulate a perturbation theory  around free electrons.  This research program
              will utilize  the Bethe ansatz, conformal field theory, supersymmetry, and 
              other methods of finding exact solutions in these strongly  interacting
              systems.    A great deal of progress has been made on developing new  methods
              for exact computations, and a number of deep results  of mathematical physics
              have been derived.  More experiments  are being done or planned on the Hall
              devices, and more  theoretical work needs to be done.  Integrable methods are 
              quite powerful, but are far from computing everything, even  in those special
              cases where they are applicable.  There are  still many interesting models of
              condensed matter physics  where exact methods should be applicable.  This
              research  will develop new tools in order to treat integrable models  by exact
              methods.  In addition, the striking progress  particle physicists have made in
              understanding  supersymmetric field theories has had only limited  application
              in condensed matter physics.  This issue will  also be pursued.  %%%  This
              grant will support theoretical research on finding  exact solutions to a
              variety of systems characterized by  electrons which interact so strongly that
              conventional  methods fail.  The techniques to be used are ones which are 
              common throughout theoretical and mathematical physics, but  which, sometimes,
              have had limited application to problems  in condensed matter physics.  ***
