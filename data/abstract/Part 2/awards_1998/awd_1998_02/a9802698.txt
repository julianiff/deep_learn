This is a cooperative research project between Prof. K. Wali of
              Syracuse University and Dr. G.C. Joshi, School of  Physics, University of
              Melbourne.  It is a continuation of a project on which they have worked
              together for a year with NSF funding.  The aim of their research is to
              understand the Dirac quantization condition in the context of nonabelian
              monopoles coupled to gravity.  They are also exploring the working of
              noncommutative geometry applied to particle interactions.
