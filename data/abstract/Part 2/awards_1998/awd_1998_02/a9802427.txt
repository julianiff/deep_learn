This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research
              collaboration between Drs. Frank K. Cartledge and Marty E. Tittlebaum,
              Louisiana State University, and Drs. Persio de Souza Santos, Antonio C. Vieira
              Coelho, and Pedro Buchler, University of Sao Paulo, and Dr. Jo Dweck,
              Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.  Partial support is being provided by
              NSF's Environmental Technology Program.

This study will look at the
              treatment of organic and mixed organic/inorganic wastes, specifically tannery
              wastes, and the use of organoclay as an additive in cement-based binder
              systems.  Different mixes will be compared using spectroscopic techniques with
              the goal of defining factors responsible for effective treatment.

The Sao
              Paulo group has broad experience with real waste streams and the properties and
              uses of clay materials that are used for immobilization of organic-containing
              wastes.  The LSU group has expertise in mechanistic studies employing various
              methods, particularly solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 
              Together, these researchers could increase our understanding of the processes
              giving effective solidification/stabilization of hazardous wastes.
