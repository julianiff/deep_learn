Abstract    :
              9802046  Goodkind    This  is  a  low temperature physics project which deals 
              with  a  recent discovery of some interesting anomalies in the propagation  of 
              sound in He-4 crystals containing small amounts of He-3.  The  anomalies
              involve the sound velocity and the acoustic attenuation  at  a temperature near
              1 K and depend on the concentration of the  He-3  impurity.  A conjecture has
              been made that these  anomalies  can  be  explained on the basis of a
              Bose-Einstein  condensation.  The purpose of this project is to perform refined
              measurements to  determine whether the anomalies give evidence for a new family
              of  excitations which travel ballistically or in a second sound mode,  and 
              whether  the  observed phase transition  is  a  truly  Bose-  Einstein 
              condensation of these excitations. This project  offers  an  opportunity  for 
              the  training of  graduate  students  in  a  forefront area of contemporary
              physics.  %%%  Research in low temperature physics has resulted in the
              discovery  of   a  phenomenon  called  the  Bose-Einstein  condensation   of 
              elementary  particles and, more recently, ultra  cold  atoms,  an  effect which
              was predicted in the 1920's. Still more recently,  a  discovery  was  made 
              that  in solid helium-4  (the  most  common  variety  of  this element) a
              peculiar and as yet  not  understood  behavior  of  the propagation of sound
              and its attenuation  takes  place when the solid contains a small amount of the
              light isotope  helium-3  as  an  impurity.  There  is  no  accepted 
              explanation  available for this anomalous behavior and a suggestion  that  the 
              observed phenomenon is due to a Bose-Einstein condensation is met  with 
              skepticism.  The proposed research is designed  to  provide  more  accurate 
              and detailed data which will allow  a  definitive  interpretation of the
              anomaly.  The resolution of this problem is  of  fundamental  importance to the
              physics of  condensed  matter.  This  project offers an opportunity for the
              trainin g of  graduate  students in a forefront area of contemporary physics.
