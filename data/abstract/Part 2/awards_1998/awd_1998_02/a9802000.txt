              Uemura    This experimental research project is devoted to unusual magnetic 
              behavior  in  pure and doped spin-gap systems, and in spin-liquid  systems,  as
               studied  by  muon  spin  relaxation.  Of  principal  interest are
              low-dimensional and/or geometrically frustrated spin  systems. Of interest are
              conditions for the formation/absence  of  spin  freezing,  the role of
              frustration, and effects  of  charge  doping  and  magnetic dilution. In more
              detail, four  topics  and  systems  of  interest  are: 1) questions of ordering
               temperature  and/or ordered moment size in quasi 1-d zig-zag spin chain   
              SrCuO2  and LixV2O5; 2) charge/vacancy doping effects in  2-leg  ladders
              Sr2(Cu,Zn)4O6, LaCuO2.5, and (Ca,Mg)(V,Ti)2O5; 3)  ground  state  of  pure  and
               perturbed geometrically frustrated  systems  LiV2O4, (Y,Sc)Mn2, CePt2Sn2; and
              4) magnetic properties of linear  chains  and 2-leg ladders in the hybrid
              (La,Sr,Ca)14Cu24O41.  The  muon   spin  relaxation  experiments  are  performed
               at  TRIUMF,  magnetic  susceptibility  measurements at  Columbia  and  neutron
               scattering   studies   at  JAERI.  This   research   program   is 
              interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or more graduate  or  postgraduate
                students,  who  receive  excellent   training   in  preparation  for careers
              in industry, government laboratories  or  academia.  %%%  This  experimental
              basic research project is devoted  to  unusual  magnetic  behavior  in 
              crystalline specimens  of  a  variety  of  inorganic chemical compounds. The
              questions of interest  are  the  local  behavior  of the magnetic species in
              the samples,  and  an  advanced  experimental method called "muon  spin 
              relaxation"  is  used  in  this work. The measurement has to be made at a 
              special  accelerator  facility where the muons (mu mesons),  are  produced  and
              injected into the sample of interest. The measurement reveals  the magnetic
              field strength inside the sample at those loca tions,  often  near  internal
              magnetic moments, where  the  muons  become  trapped before they undergo decay.
              Of interest are conditions for  the  formation/absence of spin freezing, the
              role of frustration,  and  effects  of  charge doping and magnetic  dilution.

              ordering temperature and/or ordered moment size in quasi 1-d zig-  zag  spin 
              chain  SrCuO2  and LixV2O5; 2)  charge/vacancy  doping  effects   in   2-leg  
              ladders   Sr2(Cu,Zn)4O6,   LaCuO2.5,   and  (Ca,Mg)(V,Ti)2O5;   3)  ground 
              state  of  pure   and   perturbed  geometrically frustrated systems LiV2O4,
              (Y,Sc)Mn2, CePt2Sn2; and  4)  magnetic properties of linear chains and 2-leg
              ladders in the  hybrid  (La,Sr,Ca)14Cu24O41.The muon spin relaxation 
              experiments  are performed at TRIUMF, magnetic susceptibility measurements  at 
              Columbia and neutron scattering studies at JAERI. The results  of  this
              research will be of importance in magnetism, and in physical  theory.  They 
              may  lead to new methods that can  be  applied  in  chemistry  and  in 
              nanoscale electronic devices.  This  research  program  is interdisciplinary in
              nature and involves one or  more  graduate or postgraduate students, who
              receive excellent training  in  preparation for careers in industry, government
               laboratories  or academia.  ***
