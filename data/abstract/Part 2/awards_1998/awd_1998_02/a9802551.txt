The aim of the proposed research is to explore the role of
              physics beyond the standard model of particle physics with an emphasis on
              supersymmetric models, and to explore theoretical and dynamical aspects of
              supersymmetry.  The standard model is the most successful physical theory
              constructed to date.  However, a glaring problem with the standard model is the
              need for extreme fine tuning of fundamental parameters to explain why observed
              particles are light compared to much larger mass scales that are believed to
              play a fundamental role in nature.  Supersymmetry provides an elegant framework
              for solving this problem, and the research in this proposal will study the
              puzzles of the standard model in this framework.  These include the origin of
              masses, the possibility of neutrino mass, and symmetries whose origin or
              pattern of violation are not understood.  Another area of the proposed research
              concerns theoretical investigations of supersymmetric models with a view to
              possible applications in particle physics.  Topics include the investigation of
              strongly coupled models (including dynamical supersymmetry breaking), anomalies
              in supersymmetric theories, the low-energy effective theory of string theory.
