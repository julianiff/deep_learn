Abstract    :
              DEL CASINO, V.J.  University of Kentucky  The research investigates the spatial
              distribution of HIV/AIDS as well as the geographic dimensions of health care
              outreach in Chiang Mai province, Thailand.  The study: (1) traces the
              development and growth of the AIDS (PWH/A) support group movement in relation
              to the growing HIV/AIDS population; (2) examines the organizational and spatial
              strategies used by the AIDS Foundation in developing PWH/A groups; and (3)
              investigates the operations and outreach projects affiliated with the AIDS
              Foundation.  The social, political, and economic contexts of these processes
              are examined in order to expand our understanding of the medical spaces of
              health care.  The significance of the study is that it examines both disease
              and health care facility distribution coincidentally in a non-Western context
              and thereby promises advances in the field of medical geography.  A new
              methodological framework for cross-cultural and cross-institutional analysis
              will be developed.
