Abstract    :
              9802127  Bang  A new approach has been directed in the research to overcome  the
              difficulties in concrete remediation, focusing on  several reinforcement
              properties of microbial remediation of  cracks in concrete; high retention of
              filling materials  containing microorganisms, reduction of permeability, and 
              high bonding strength between crack filling and concrete  which can sustain
              environmental changes.  In detail, the  research is to employ an immobilization
              technique for  remediation of cracks in concrete, where microbial cells 
              encapsulated in polymers induce calcium carbonate  precipitation to fill up the
              gap and  enhance the strength  for selective cementation.  Extensive kinetic
              studies in the  immobolized cell system are planned to understand the 
              relationship of calcite precipitation to the chemical  bonding between filling
              materials and concrete.  Results  from the kinetic studies will then be scaled
              up using  mathematical models and directly incorporated into field 
              application.
