Abstract    :
              9802747  Schall  This equipment grant is to provide a high performance liquid
              chromatographic (HPLC) system which is to be used for several research
              projects.  These include: 1) Protein Crystallization; The Effects of Protein
              Impurities; 2) Treatment of Aqueous Organic Wastes by Catalytic Oxidation; 3)
              Use of Site-Directed Mutagenesis to Improve Protein Crystallization; and 4)
              Optimization of Mammalian Cell Culture Conditions for Protein Production.  ***
