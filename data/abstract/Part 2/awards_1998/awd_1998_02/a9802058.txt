Abstract    :
                Automated monitoring of pelagic fish assemblage during El Ni¹o/Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO)  The El Ni¹o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an interannual
              pattern in the ocean-atmosphere circulation in the Pacific Ocean.  During El
              Ni¹os the trade winds weaken and vary in direction, decreasing upwelling. 
              Nutrients no longer reach the euphotic zone and phytoplankton production is
              depressed.  This reduces the amount of biomass in the lower trophic levels and
              results in the migration of the larger predators from the geographic area in
              search of alternative forage.  During La Ni¹as, the antithesis of El Ni¹os, the
              eastern Pacific waters are cooler than normal, biomass in the lower trophic
              levels is high, and large predators are abundant.  The physical processes
              during the ENSO and the effect on the distribution and migratory behavior of
              members of the higher trophic levels, i.e., the large vertebrate predators, are
              poorly known.  Such studies to date have been confined to salmonids off the
              coast of Oregon, sea turtles in the eastern tropical Pacific, and pinnipeds in
              the eastern temperate Pacific.  The observed sea surface temperature anomaly
              along the western coast of the Baja Peninsula area reached +5Ý C during
              September 1997.  The multivariate ENSO index indicates that as of June-July its
              intensity exceeds all others of the century and should have a profound
              ecological effect on the oceans.  We propose to study the response of an
              assemblage of pelagic fishes to an El Ni¹o by visual censuses of adults,
              sampling ichthyoplankton, and tagging members with coded acoustic beacons and
              detecting their presence with electronic listening devices.  These devices will
              be moored at seamounts and islands within the Gulf of California and off the
              Pacific coast of the Baja Peninsula.  Water temperature will be recorded hourly
              at these sites with loggers attached to the monitors and related to AVHRR
              satellite images of sea surface temperature.  This study will compliment and
              geographically extend a long-term collaborative project with Mexican colleagues
              investigating the effects of mesoscale oceanographic processes on the seasonal
              movements of marlins, sharks, tunas, etc.  Another primary objective of this
              study is to train doctoral students from Mexico in the use of state-of-the-art
              fish tracking equipment.
