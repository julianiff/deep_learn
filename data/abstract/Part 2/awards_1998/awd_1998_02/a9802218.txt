Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9802218  ROSE    This planning award funds the Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute to hold an industry/university meeting to determine the
              feasibility and viability of the university becoming a research site associated
              with the University of Arizona's Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Microcontamination and Defect Control.    Research projects
              envisioned to augment the Center's research agenda are 1) Spectroscopic
              Ellipsometry Studies of Interfaces, 2) Defect Control during CMP, 3) Tracking
              Particulates in a PECVD Reactor, 4) Ultrapurification of Hydrofluric Acid
              Etching Solutions using Membrane Based Reprocessor, 5) Post-CMP Cleaning, 6)
              Defect Analysis for Improved BEOL Yield Modeling, 7) Control of Plasma
              Process-Induced Particle Formation, and 8) Defect Characterization of CMP
              Surfaces using Lateral Force Microscope.    The Principal Investigator and his
              colleagues are recognized experts in their fields and are well qualified to run
              this planning grant.
