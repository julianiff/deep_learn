The project is devoted to the study of quantum field theories
              on
algebraic curves from complex analytic and algebraic points of view.
In
              the complex analytic setting the main goal is to develop a
geometric approach
              for calculating correlation functions of degenerate
primary fields in the
              two-dimensional quantum gravity and to apply the
chiral action functional for
              higher genus Riemann surfaces to the
differential geometry of Earle-Eells
              principal fiber bundle over the
Teichmuller space and to other problems. In
              the algebraic setup the
goal is to develop, following an idea of E. Witten, a
              new method in
the theory of algebraic functions of one variable over arbitrary
              field
of constants using various quantum field theories over
              algebraic
curves. In particular, for the theory of free bosons
              this
"field-theoretical" paradigm will provide a new proof of A.
              Weil's
reciprocity law on algebraic curves. Development of this program
              will
have a broad impact on the class field theory of fields of
              algebraic
functions with a possibility to work for algebraic number fields
              as
well. In the latter case the goal is to derive classical Gauss
quadratic
              reciprocity law and its generalizations as "conformal Ward
identities" for
              quantum field theories.

Ideas from physics, originated from the study of
              surrounding world,
have always played a pivotal role in the development of
              mathematics.
Recently dramatic progress was made in the study of geometry
              and
topology in four dimensions by using methods of quantum field theory.
In
              a sense, special quantum fields on a four-dimensional manifold - a
geometric
              object in four-dimensional space - turned out to probe its
geometric and
              topological properties and by measuring their response
one gets a nontrivial
              information about the manifold. The goal of this
proposal is to develop a
              similar method for studying algebraic and
arithmetic properties of surfaces
              and number fields (like the usual
field of rational numbers) by using quantum
              fields. Many fundamental
properties of these objects are discrete and so it is
              natural to study
them using quantum theory.  In particular, many classical
              results
about fields of algebraic functions and algebraic numbers, known
              as
reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation laws
              (like
conservation of energy) in quantum field theory.  The main goal of
              the
proposal is to develop a new paradigm based on quantum theory
              for
studying the fundamental laws that are satisfied by the very
              basic
mathematical objects: algebraic numbers - solutions of
              algebraic
equations with coefficients being rational numbers, and
              algebraic
functions - solutions of algebraic equations with coefficients
              being
rational functions.
