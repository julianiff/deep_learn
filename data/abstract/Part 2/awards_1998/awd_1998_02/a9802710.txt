Abstract    :
                    9802710  Lander  This project involves a worldwide expansion to the
              tsunami  database and an extension of the catalog to the end of the 
              millennium, adding data from upcoming symposia and workshops and  checking
              local marigrams for magnitude 6 or greater earthquake  data for unreported
              minor tsunamis.  The manuscript will be put  online to allow for peer review
              and adaptation of currently  available digital technology applied to updating
              this catalog for  future tsunamis compilations.  This expanded database will be
               available to the research and education communities on the World  Wide Web. 
              These innovations in catalog compilations should  increase the
              comprehensiveness and accuracy of the catalog.   Photographic data will also be
              included.  Extracts of events in  respective areas will be sent for review to
              International  Oceanographic Commission National Representatives.    A history
              of the occurrence and effects of previous tsunamis is  the essential starting
              point in devising an effective mitigation  plan and a component of many
              research efforts.  Tsunamis  histories, both regional and global, have been
              produced for this  purpose.  However, there is no annual summary or single
              place  where information on recent tsunamis can be found.  The final  report of
              this project will carry information on the availability  and effectiveness of
              warnings, the awareness of the population to  the possibility of a tsunami
              following a strong earthquake, and  the listing of each tsunami and a summary
              of effects at each  observed locality, as well as a geographical index so that 
              effects for a region can be quickly located.  ***
