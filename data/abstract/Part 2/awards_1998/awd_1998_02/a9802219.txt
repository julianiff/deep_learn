              Research Infrastructure:  The UCSD Active Web

UCSD is investigating system
              and application support issues for a next-generation World Wide Web, called the
              "Active Web."  The Active Web is premised on the support for active content,
              content that is rich in multimedia and references to other objects, and for
              mobile agents, programs that can move about and execute on remote servers,
              carrying out requests at a distance on behalf of clients.  These servers are no
              longer passive databases as in today's Web, but context-sensitive knowledge
              networks that contain all kinds of active content.  Between the servers, there
              is a constant exchange of agents, which add to, refine, form interconnections,
              and make consistent, the distributed content. In the Active Web, there is a
              high degree of resource sharing, usage is bought and sold as in a market
              economy, and security is paramount.  This grant will allow UCSD to purchase
              large-scale computer and storage servers and a high-speed network that will
              connect the various laboratories, and will form a small-scale Active Web
              prototype.

The project is taking a department-wide coordinated approach,
              integrating the research efforts in systems, security, multimedia,
              content-based search, scientific metacomputing, and, tools for
              software/hardware design and analysis.
