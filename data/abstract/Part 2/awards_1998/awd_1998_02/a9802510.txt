	The research in theoretical elementary particle physics
              will focus on superstring, supergravity and supersymmetric field theories.  The
              underlying fundamental symmetries of superstring theory will be studied and
              these symmetries will then be used to determine the spectra of superstring
              theory and related supersymmetric theories.  The mathematical methods that are
              essential for carrying out this program will be developed further.  The
              superstring theory provides us with the only known consistent framework for
              reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of gravity and is a
              promising candidate for a successful unified theory of all interactions
              including gravity.  The determination of the spectrum of superstring theory
              will be essential for testing its predictions.  At certain energy regimes
              superstring theory can be effectively approximated by supergravity and other
              supersymmetric field theories.  Therefore, the work on superstring,
              supergravity and supersymmetric field theories is very important.
