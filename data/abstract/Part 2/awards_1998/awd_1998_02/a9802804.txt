Abstract    :
              9802804  Scott    Support is provided for the Third International Conference  on
              Grain Growth at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, June
              14-19, 1998.  This conference follows  previous conferences held in Rome, Italy
              (1991), and in  Kitakyushu, Japan (1995.  The field of microstructural 
              evolution has recently come into the forefront of materials  research and grain
              growth is a core topic.  There are two  recent developments which lead to more
              intense research  interest in this field.  One is the advance of computer 
              simulation techniques which, coupled with ever increasing  computational power,
              is capable of giving realistic and  statistically significant predictions of
              microstructural  evolution.  The second is development of automated 
              experimental techniques capable of accurately describing the  microstructure
              (grain size, shape, crystallographic  orientation, etc.) in sufficient detail
              as to provide good  statistical descriptions of microstructure.  Primary among 
              these experimental techniques is orientational imaging  microscopy using the
              texture measuring capability scanning  electron microscopy.  These parallel
              developments in  computation and experiment make this conference timely so 
              that direct interactions occur between the theoretical  modelers and the
              experimental investigators.  This special  topics meeting brings together the
              world's leading  scientists in grain growth.  The support helps defray travel 
              expenses for the distinguished speakers from abroad and  provides travel grants
              for student co-authors.  %%%  It is well known in both metallurgy and ceramics
              that  microstructure control is based on processing conditions and  choice of
              composition, and this provides a pathway to  improved material properties. 
              Under a broad range of  conditions grain growth lies at the heart of
              microstructural  evolution.  The consequences of grain growth are of 
              considerable technological and industrial importance in  determining the
              manufacturability and service life of  met als, ceramics, and other fine grain
              materials.  The  Pittsburgh conference organized by The Mineral, Metals and 
              Materials Society with co-sponsorship by ASM International  and Materials
              Research Society deals with all aspects of  grain growth in materials.  ***
