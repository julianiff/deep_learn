Abstract    :
              Galen Martin  University of California, Davis  The doctoral dissertation
              research proposal will focus upon how contrasting visions of conservation and
              development have been, and continue to be, played out in situ on the Caribbean
              Coast of Costa Rica.  More specifically, the study will examine natural
              resource use patterns as practiced by three groups: local residents who use the
              Cahuita area as livelihood space, tourists and the tourist industry, and
              conservationists.  A detailed case study is presented of a community whose
              people and landscape are directly shaped by an exogenous conservation agenda
              imposed by a national park.  Data will be obtained from interviews with
              individuals in the three groups and also through focus groups.  A major
              accomplishment will be the articulation of how these groups view sustainable
              development and participatory conservation and what implications this may have
              for policy development.
