Abstract    :
              The proposed doctoral dissertation research is a survey of local human relations
              commissions (HRCs) in California. The project involves conducting interviews
              with directors of each of the 45 commissions throughout the state, informed by
              an ongoing case study of one such commission in southern California. The
              subject of research is the shifting institutional nexus within which HRCs
              operate and upon which they rely for support. That nexus is shaped generally by
              the interaction of the various social movement and associational organizations,
              state agencies and bodies, and market-based institutions with which they
              interact. Research will inquire into the nature of the effect which those
              institutions exert upon the political agendas emerging within HRCs. The
              theoretical framework which links institutional alignment to political agendas
              focuses on organizational adaptation to their environment. HRCs represent
              strategic sites for such inquiry, as they represent political "mediating
              institutions" in the arena of race/ethnic relations. It is a propitious era of
              transformation for the more general investigation of institutional effects,
              given the contemporary shifts most evident in the ongoing state-market
              realignment. The geographical setting is also strategic given California's
              national leadership in socio-demographic and political-economic
              transformations.
