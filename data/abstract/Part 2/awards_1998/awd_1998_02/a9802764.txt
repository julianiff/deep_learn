This Americas Program award will fund a three-year
              cooperative research project between Dr. Charles Raymond, University of
              Washington and Dr. Gino Rogazinski Casassa, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta
              Arenas, Chile, to study the Patagonian Icefields, one of the largest
              accumulation of non-polar ice in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of the
              largest in the world.  Observations confined to the marginal areas of these
              icefields show evidence of substantial loss of ice mass over the last half
              century that would contribute to rising sea levels.  

The collaborators seek
              to use modern remote sensing, ground measurements, and modeling methods, with
              the purpose of initiating field work to get critical new information on the ice
              discharge from the interior of the Southern Patagonian Icefield.   This
              information will be significant with regard to the potential hazard of seal
              level rise from Patagonian ice and how imminent it could be. The proposal
              involves collaboration, not only with the Universidad de Magallanes, but also
              with the Universidad de Chile, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of
              Washington and the University of Alaska.  Results of this initial  research 
              will allow the formulation of a more extensive research proposal to address the
              mass balance and climate control of Patagonian ice.
