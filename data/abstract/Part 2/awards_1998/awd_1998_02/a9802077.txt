              Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9802077  Principal Investigator: Mark Adler    What
              is the connection of random matrices with integrable systems?  Is this
              connection useful?The answer to these questions leads to a  new and unifying
              approach to the theory of random matrices.  Introducing an appropiate
              t-dependence in the probability   distribution of the matrix ensemble, leads to
              vertex operator   expressions for the n-point correlation functions
              (probabilities of  n eigenvalues in infinitesmal intervals) and the
              corresponding Fredholm  determinants (probabilities of no eigenvalues in a
              Borel set of R).  This representation leads to PDE's for the Fredholm
              determinant.  This covers the finite Hermitean ensemble,the symplectic and 
              symmetric ensemble and even a coupled matrix ensemble. These are   related to
              reductions of 2-Toda and 1-Toda and the KP hierarchy.    We work in the general
              theory of nonlinear equations of engineering   and mathematical physics.The
              type of equations we study figure into   ultra-short transmissions in fiber
              optics,intense pulses in lasers,  water wave transmission in narrow
              channels,slow nuclear reactions and   the physical properties of bulk metals at
              high temperatures as well as   the general excitation theory of heavy nuclei. 
              We also study equations   connected with string theory in quantum field theory,
              an exciting area   of research in modern physics.
