Abstract    :
              9802184  Panoskaltsis    "Mechanics of Clays:  Shear Banding and Anisotropy"   
              The objective of this research is the development of a  theoretical and 
              computational framework which will constitute the basis for  the  complete
              characterization of the irrecoverable, path-  dependent and  anisotropic
              behavior of clays, including localization  phenomenon.  A  general
              elastoplastic constitutive model will be developed.    In particular, three
              aspects of this extremely complex  behavior will be  addressed.  The first one
              concerns the modeling of the  response of both  normally consolidated and
              overconsolidated clays.  For this  purpose,  the elastoplastic theory which
              will be employed is not the  classical  one but a new one, which is based on
              loading-unloading  irreversibility  and on a shift of the emphasis from the
              concept of yield  surface to the  concept of the elastic range.  The new theory
              has the  capability to  describe both conventional and unconventional patterns
              of  elastic-plastic behavior, in addition to being very  attractive from a 
              computational point of view.    The second issue to be addresses deals with the
              modeling of  the  influence of soil anisotropy, both initial and stress 
              induced, in the  observed response.  The last issue to be addressed is that  of
               localization of deformation, the determination of the  orientation and  the
              width of the localized zone, as well as the associated  mesh  sensitivity. 
              This is a very important issue, since crack  initiation  and propagation play a
              significant role in the  serviceability and  behavior of structures.  ***
