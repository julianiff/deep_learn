Abstract    :
              Arlin Crotts  9802809  The universe's hydrogen budget from z=5 to z=0: 
              constraints from the Lyman alpha forest    Dr. Crotts is studying the
              connection between the Lyman alpha forest cloud sizes, shapes, clustering and
              number density estimates in order to compare them with those of galaxies and
              results from numerical models. Dr. Crotts uses numerical models that simulate
              the reaction of gas to collapse dominated by cold dark matter.  He is using
              both ground based and HST data for this work.    Astronomers have detailed
              information about the two extremes in lookback time.  At zero redshift (i.e.,
              the present) we can measure the masses of galaxies, including how much material
              is gaseous.  At very high redshifts the isotopic abundance rations set by the
              Big Bang determines how much gas existed at early epochs.  In between these
              extremes lies a complex set of conditions that are addressed by the study of
              the Lyman alpha forest.  The Lyman alpha forest is a dense set of spectroscopic
              absorption lines that cluster near the Lyman alpha break in the spectrum of
              quasars.  These lines have been identified as coming from intervening clouds
              between the Earth and the quasar.  By mapping the distances of these clouds,
              one may deduce some of the large scale structure of the universe as well as
              other cosmological parameters.    ****
