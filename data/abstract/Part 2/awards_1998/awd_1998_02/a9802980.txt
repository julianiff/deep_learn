Abstract    :
              AST 98-02980  Alex Szalay    The structure of the universe beyond 100 Mpc    The
              PI is addressing several major questions related to the large scale
              distribution of galaxies.  The study of large scale structure of the Universe
              is one of the most dynamically evolving areas of astrophysics today.  Various
              cosmologies provide estimates of the fluctuation spectrum (deviation from
              smoothness).  This work by the PI helps to distinguish and constrain various
              cosmologies.      In particular, the PI is measuring the fluctuation spectrum
              of the galaxy distribution on very large (> 100Mpc) scales, overlapping with
              measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations.  This work
              will clarify the nature of the power spectrum on very large scales, lock the
              small and large scale normalization of the power spectrum together.  The
              analysis techniques may result in major new developments in understanding the
              nature of the fluctuations on scales over 100 Mpc.  The least know, and at the
              same time the most interesting part of the fluctuation spectrum is on scales
              between 100 - 300 Mpc, close to the horizon scale at equality and
              recombination, where we have the most reasons to believe that something may
              have left a detectable imprint, like the Doppler peaks in the CMB fluctuations.
