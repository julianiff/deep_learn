Abstract    :
                        Markman  9802532    The problems studied in this project arise from
              the  interaction of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and integrable
              systems.  Part 1 of the project consists of the study of a birational duality 
              among moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces arising from the Brill-Noether 
              stratification of these symplectic moduli spaces. The interaction of this 
              duality with a representation of the Heisenberg algebra on the total cohomology
              of sequences of moduli spaces is investigated.  In Part 2 of the project the
              theory of integrable systems will be  used to compare the boundary of the
              compactified Picard of an  algebraic curve with planar singularities to the
              boundary of coadjoint  orbits of loop algebras.      This is research in the
              field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of
              modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the
              past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined 
              in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology,
              and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
