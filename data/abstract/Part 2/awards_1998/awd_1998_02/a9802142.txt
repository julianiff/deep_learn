Abstract    :
                  In the last twenty years, organizations and service providers that cater to
              the homeless have noted a change in their clientele: Increasingly, entire
              families are looking for places to sleep. Extant research tells us little about
              the lives of homeless families and the processes by which people attempt to
              work their way back into stable housing. This doctoral dissertation research
              begins with the assumptions that homelessness is part of a broader struggle
              that families engage in to endure poverty, and that social networks and
              community dynamics are an important part of this strategy. The project involves
              a longitudinal study of family homelessness, Census data and policy archives to
              examine (1) how race, class, gender and local policies impact upon networks,
              (2) how parents of homeless families manipulate and re-structure their networks
              to negotiate structural arrangements, and (3) how both of the above impact upon
              the role of networks on social well-being as time goes on. The results of this
              project will have significant scientific and policy related implications.
              First, they will increase our understanding of homelessness beyond its mere
              onset. Second, they will promote efforts to develop more dynamic conceptions of
              how structures and networks operate. Finally, the results will inform us about
              the impact of a homeless policy now being implemented at the federal level.
