Abstract    :
              ***  Tung  Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will  include
              work on Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory  which describes the strong
              nuclear force. This work will  emphasize global analysis of experimental data
              to determine  the precise composition of the nucleon in terms of quarks  and
              gluons. This composition must be known in order to  predict the rates of
              physical processes involving nucleons  which probe both the existing "Standard
              Model" of elementary  particle physics, and new physics which lies beyond this 
              Standard Model. There will also be work on the question of  how the symmetry
              between the electromagnetic and the weak  nuclear forces is broken in nature,
              and on the search for  supersymmetry, a hypothesized symmetry between the
              particles  which are the constituents of matter, and the particles that  carry
              the forces between bits of matter. All of these  studies are important to our
              greater understanding of the  Standard Model, and to our search for physics
              beyond it.  ***
