	Quantitative modeling of cold-atom, Bose-Einstein condensates
              and atoms lasers under realistic conditions is performed using a variety of
              theoretical and computational techniques.  Properties to be studied include the
              coherence properties of the condensate, manipulation of the condensate by
              optical techniques and finite temperature effects.
