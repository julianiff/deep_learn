Research in theoretical particle physics will explore new
              and promising directions in the phenomenology of supersymmetric models. 
              Laboratory signatures of wide classes of gauge-mediated supersymmetric theories
              will be identified, constraints on unified theories will be derived and related
              directly to experimentally-observable quantities, the implications for
              fundamental explanations of elementary particle masses will be explored, and
              stronger ties will be forged with astrophysics and cosmology.  Supersymmetry is
              the leading candidate for the physics underlying the spectacularly successful
              current "standard model" of particle physics, and a dedicated investigation of
              its observable implications is crucial to its discovery and study.
