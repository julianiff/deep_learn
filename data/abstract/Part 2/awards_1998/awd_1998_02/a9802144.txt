Abstract    :
              9802144  Salas  Over the last decade, the role of computational simulations in
              all aspects of design has steadily increased.  Today, large scale computations
              are prevalent in all areas of aeronautical, atmospheric, and space research. 
              However, despite the many advances in computational modelling over the last
              decade, the time required for computations necessary to significantly advance
              the state-of-the art is far too long.  The impact is that significant
              improvements in designs, proof of concept for revolutionary designs. and a
              basic understanding of important physics is severely deterred.  In fact, it
              could be argued that effective/efficient progress in most areas of aeronautic,
              atmospheric and much of space access research is currently paced by, and indeed
              hostage to, the cost and speed of carrying out parametric computations.  In
              many cases, further progress is severely impeded or nearly impossible without a
              dramatic change in the status quo.  The purpose of this workshop is to share
              new and emerging ideas that enable complex, multidisciplinary, numerical
              simulations in the aerospace sciences in time periods of minutes to hours
              instead of weeks or months.  Time to set up the simulations, including surface
              definition or alteration and gridding (if required) are included in simulation
              time as is any necessary post-processing.  It should be emphasized that the
              workshop is aimed at examining new ideas and methodologies that may not be
              fruitful or possible at the current time, but may be so in the next twenty
              years.  A symposium proceedings will be published.  ***
