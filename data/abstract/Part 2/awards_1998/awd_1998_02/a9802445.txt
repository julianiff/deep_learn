Abstract    :
                  9802445  Hall  This application requests partial funding for a FASEB Summer
              Research Conference on Renal Hemodynamics: Integration of Endothelial
              Epithelial and Vascular Control Mechanisms to be held on June 27-July 2, 1998
              at Vermont Academy, Saxton's River, Vermont under the auspices of the
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).  The
              conference will assemble investigators from multiple disciplines who use
              diverse approaches (cell and molecular to integrative whole animal) to
              understand the regulation of the renal circulation.  The format consists of
              nine major sessions, five morning and four evening sessions, with daily
              pre-dinner poster discussion sessions.  There will be approximately 75 invited
              speakers who, after brief overview by the session chairs, will address current
              unresolved issues and recent ongoing research directed at their resolution. 
              Each speaker has been asked to present their most recent unpublished work and
              to focus on identifying the major unanswered questions in the field and the
              experimental approaches to answering these questions.  Each presentation is
              followed by discussion and there is a large amount of time available in the
              afternoons for informal discussions among the participants.  Previous
              conferences in 1989, 1992, and 1995 were very successful and conducive to the
              exchange of ideas among the participants.  Given the rapid developments in this
              important area, we expect that the 1998 conference will foster further exchange
              and interaction among investigators working at different levels within this
              complex integrated system.  To stimulate future investigative interests in the
              area, attempts have been made to identify young investigators from active,
              contributing laboratories as speakers (including fellows and trainees) with
              special attention given to minorities and women.
