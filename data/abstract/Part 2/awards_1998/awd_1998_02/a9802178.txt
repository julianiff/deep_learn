Abstract    :
              RADFORD,  98-02178    Abstract    The proposer will continue his long term
              investigation into invariants of knots,  1-1 tangles and 3-manifolds which
              arise from various algebraic structures. The focus  of this phase of his work
              is the study of  quantum coalgebras and the invariants they determine. They
              account for the invariants which arise from finite dimensional quantum 
              algebras. Coquasitriangular Hopf algebras are examples of quantum coalgebras.  
               Hopf  algebras and quantum groups are algebraic objects whose study is
              important  in contemporary physics and also which have application to geometric
              and topological   problems. Knot theory has seen applications in the studying
              molecular structure.
