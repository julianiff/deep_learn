Abstract    :
              9802304  Stowell      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-one-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Michael H. B. Stowell to work with Dr. 
              Nigel Unwin at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in  Cambridge, England and
              with Dr. Yoshinori Fujiyoshi at Kyoto  University on the investigation of the
              structural basis of  ligand-gated ion channel opening and desensitization. This
               is supported jointly by the IRFAP and the U.S.-Japan  Program.   
              Specifically, they will be studying the structure of an  acetylcholine receptor
              (AchR), which is a membrane protein/  ion channel, which functions as a
              transmitter in the brain  which allows the transmission of neuronal signals so
              that we  may perform such functions as walking and talking.  Studying  the
              structure of this receptor, is like looking at a  blueprint for answering
              important biological and biophysical  questions about the functioning of this
              protein.  To do  this, Dr. Stowell will use a liquid helium cooled electron 
              microscope, developed by Dr. Fujiyoshi, a microscope thought  to be the only
              one in the world sophisticated enough to do  this research.  He will use
              techniques devised by Dr. Unwin,  helical crystal preparation and image
              analysis.  ***
