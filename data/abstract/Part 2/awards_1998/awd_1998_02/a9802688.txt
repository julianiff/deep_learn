Abstract    :
              The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University proposes to continue
              development and conduct evaluation activities to support the field of science,
              mathematics, engineering and technology education that were initiated under a
              previous grant with the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication. 
              Under this award, the Evaluation Center will continue to conduct a summer
              training workshop for evaluators followed by internships in an NSF program, and
              will expand training to awareness workshops in the Regional Educational
              Laboratories.  They will also continue to develop an Evaluator's Directory on
              the web and will expand their electronic services to include a help desk on
              evaluation and to provide listings of  tools, models, and professional
              activities.
