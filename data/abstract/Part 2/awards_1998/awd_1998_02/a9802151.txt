Abstract    :
                  9802151  Chang  This project explores how user impacts can be incorporated
              into  methods for assessing the cost effectiveness of seismic risk  management
              measures for infrastructure systems.  It seeks to  demonstrate how user costs
              can be applied within the framework of  life cycle costs analysis.  Life cycle
              cost analysis, an approach  related to benefit/cost analysis, considers
              maintenance and other  long-term costs associated with an investment project in
              addition  to the initial cost of construction.  It has the advantage of 
              allowing the assessment of seismic hazard mitigation in the  context of routine
              infrastructure management practice.  This is  particularly important in the
              case of infrastructure systems  where some types of seismic upgrading
              procedures (e.g., pipe  replacement) may reduce normal maintenance costs as a
              collateral  benefit.  Specific tasks include establishing guidelines for 
              consideration for user costs, developing a user cost methodology  within the
              framework of life cycle costs analysis, and  implementating two to three case
              studies using actual urban  infrastructure systems in seismically vulnerable
              regions of the  U.S.  ***
