Abstract    :
              9702556  Griffeath   This award provides funds to partially support a workshop
              on cellular automata   theory to be held at the Santa Fe Institute. The purpose
              of the workshop is to bring   together researchers from different disciplines
              to help foster the development of rigorous   results in cellular automata. The
              workshop will focus on three active areas of cellular   automata research:
              shape and interface theory, constructive analysis of Conway's Life, and  
              algorithmic complexity of elementary cellular automata.
