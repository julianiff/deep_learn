This one-year award supports US-UK cooperative research on
              the interaction of C-H bonds with transition metals (TM).  Such interactions
              are fundamental to understanding selective activation of hydrocarbon-based,
              petrofeedstocks by TM catalysis.  The collaboration involves Thomas Cundari of
              the University of Memphis and A. Guy Orpen of the University of Bristol. 
              Several questions will be addressed in this current study.  First, how do
              intermolecular C-H/TM interactions differ, structurally and energetically, from
              their intramolecular counterparts?  Second, how do the interactions of C-H
              bonds with TMs change as the electronic and steric profile of each is altered? 
              Third, can the study of C-H/TM interactions help develop accurate and efficient
              modeling techniques for large organometallic complexes that are of interest in
              catalysis?

The US investigator brings to this collaboration experience in
              computational modeling of TM chemistry.  This is complemented by the UK
              researchers' expertise in X-ray crystallography and its applications to
              structural chemistry.  The project will advance understanding of the behavior
              of TM molecules and methods for modeling their dynamical behavior or reactivity
              with other molecules.
