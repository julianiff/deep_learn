This award provides partial support to replace a Helium
              Liquefier module operated for the last 20 years by the School of Physics and
              Astronomy at the University of Minnesota, and to refurbish two series 1400
              compressors.  The system will be used to supply liquid helium to the Condensed
              Matter Physics Group, and to other research groups outside of Physics at the
              University of Minnesota.  In the Condensed Matter Physics Group research
              dependent on the availability of liquid helium, includes programs on "Pairing
              Spectroscopy of Exotic Superconductors," "Magnetic Superconductor Interface
              Structures and High Temperature Superconducting Compounds," "Tunneling and
              Transport in Ordered and Disordered Superconductors," "Phase Slip in Superfluid
              4He Flow through Microscopic Apertures," "Magnetization Reversal in Magnetic
              Particles: Classical and Quantum Regimes," "Ultra-low Temperature Properties of
              Metals," and "Quantum Phase Transition in Low-Dimensional Systems."  Users
              outside Condensed Matter include the Astronomy Department, which has a program
              of Infrared Astronomy with a telecope situated at Marine on St. Croix, east of
              the Twin Cities, the Chemistry, Biochemistry (College of Biological Sciences
              and Medical School), Medicinal Chemistry, and Radiology Departments.  The
              latter organizations support a large number of NMR facilities, and several
              small-scale MRI setups.  Additional users are in Electrical Engineering and
              Geology.  The work in Electrical Engineering is focused on Shubnikov-de Haas
              studies of semiconducting materials, and that in Geology with magnetic minerals
              and magnetotactic bacteria.  Approximately 42 faculty, 40 post doctorals, 62
              graduate students, 26 undergraduates, in more than nine disciplines/departments
              will benefit.
