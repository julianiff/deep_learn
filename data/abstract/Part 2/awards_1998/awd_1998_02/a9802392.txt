Abstract    :
              The  goals  of this research are to bring new implicit polynomial  2D curve and
              3D surface object recognition concepts to a state of  general  usefulness to
              researchers in computer vision  and  image  processing,   and  to  develop 
              computationally-fast  shape-based  indexing into 2D image and 3D image
              databases.  The approaches to  be used include new fitting concepts and
              algorithms, new types of  invariants,  new  concepts and algorithms for 
              single-computation  pose  estimation  for  implicit  polynomial  2D  curves 
              and   3D  surfaces,  and indexing by matching rich sets of 2D curvelets  or 
              rich  sets  of  3D surface patchlets with those  that  have  been  autonomously
               extracted and stored in the image databases.   This  work  will  assess the
              value of implicit polynomial  methods  for  modeling  and making inferences
              about object shape in 2D  and  3D  data.   The  research  will also produce 
              useful  tools  for  the  research   community  for  applications,  and  will 
              provide   an  understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of this technology.
               Searching and indexing into image databases is a rapidly  growing  activity 
              in science and commerce.  This project will provide  an  understanding of the
              geometric shape-based indexing accuracy  and  speed  and  the automation of
              database preparation possible  with  the new implicit polynomial methodology.
