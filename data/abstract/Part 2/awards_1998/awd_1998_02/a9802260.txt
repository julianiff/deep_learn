Abstract    :
                9802260  Collins    The goal of this proposal is to utilize newly developed
              microfabrication techniques to realize a miniature Fourier transform
              spectrometer (FTS) with spectral resolutions greater than 0.1 cm-1.  The
              projected dimensions of the Fourier transform optical bench, complete with
              optical source, mirrors, cells, and detector, is expected to be 14 cm x 8 cm x
              8 cm (5" x 3" x 3") with an estimated weight of less than 2 kg.  The miniature
              FTIR  instrument is capable of operating as a routine chemical analysis
              instrument, or because of its small size and low cost can be used as an
              automated environmental sensor to monitor virtually any pre-programmed
              collection chemical signatures.  More importantly, the miniature FTS provides a
              fundamental technology base for the eventual realization of radically new
              instrumentation and chemical analysis concepts.  With miniaturization of
              analytical instruments, a systems integration approach which combines multiple
              analytical instruments into a complete chemical laboratory housed within a
              single compact instrument becomes feasible.  The fabrication and
              characterization of the miniature FTS is the first step towards realization of
              that goal.  ***
