Abstract    :
              Abstract    The 40th Maize Genetics meeting will be held at the Grand Geneva
              Resort in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, March 19 through March 22, 1998. The location
              is optimal for participation by students from many of the major universities in
              the mid-west and its proximity to the major airport in the Chicago region makes
              it convenient for overseas scientists. The meeting will bring together students
              and established investigators using maize as an experimental organism in a
              setting conducive to encouraging intellectual interactions.
