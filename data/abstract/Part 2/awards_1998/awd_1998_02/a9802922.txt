Abstract    :
              This project concerns the distribution and structure of irreducible models of
              equational theories of algebras.  The chief goal is to determine the structural
              implications for the models of a theory which arise from the assumption that
              the theory has a bounded number of irreducible models.  The projected results
              have applications to the decidability, finite axiomatizability, categoricity,
              and equational completeness of equational classes of algebras.    Algebraic
              structures, or algebras, are mathematical objects which are used as devices for
              calculation. A typical example of an algebra is the number system we use for
              counting, although more exotic algebras find application in physics, chemistry,
              logic, and most branches of mathematics. Basic questions in algebra, such as
              the question of whether one number divides another, are solved by reducing the
              question to a related question about irreducible factor algebras. This research
              will advance the understanding of methods of calculation in irreducible
              algebras, and consequently in general algebras.
