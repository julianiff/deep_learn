This proposal is for a collaborative multi-institutional
              project to improve the quality and spatial and temporal distribution of the
              0-5~Ma paleomagnetic record from lava flows.  The ultimate goal of the project
              is to improve our understanding of how the geodynamo controls the observed
              magnetic field.  Specifically:  1) Do the mid-high latitude flux lobes and
              north polar low seen in the historical and 0-3 kyr (only northern hemisphere
              lobes resolved) records persist over paleomagnetic time scales, and 2) Are
              there are hemispheric differences in the time-averaged field and paleosecular
              variation?  In order to address these issues, the P.I.s have planned systematic
              paleomagnetic sampling of flows covering as wide an age range as possible at
              each location, followed by detailed high quality laboratory analyses.  Wherever
              possible paleointensity as well as directional records will be acquired. 
              Fourteen globally distributed sites have been selected for sampling:  the plan
              is designed to complement existing data of high quality, and avoid duplication
              of known resampling being carried out by other international groups.  The
              specific places chosen include two very high latitude locations, a north-south
              transect through the Americas, and a site from south-eastern Australia.
