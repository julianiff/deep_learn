Abstract    :
              Fogleman  9806888        Cytochrome P450 genes produce enzymes that allow
              insects to  tolerate poisonous chemicals such as insecticides and  certain
              plant compounds. Some plants protect themselves from  insects (and other
              herbivores) by making chemical compounds  that are toxic to the animals which
              try to feed on them.  Cytochrome P450 enzymes detoxify chemical compounds,
              usually  by changing their chemical structure. The study of P450  genes,
              therefore, will provide information as to how insects  become resistant to
              insecticides and/or plant defensive  chemicals.    This proposal involves the
              use of an insect-plant model  system. The insects are fruit flies of the genus
              Drosophila,  and the plants are columnar cacti which grow in the Sonoran 
              Desert of southwestern United States and Mexico. A wealth of  background
              information on this model system has already been  obtained including data on
              the ecology and genetics of the  fruit flies and identification and
              characterization of the  toxic chemicals that the cacti produce. Employing
              modern  techniques of molecular genetics, previous experiments have  isolated
              over 100 P450 genes from desertadapted  drosophilids. Since there are multiple
              P450 genes in each  insect species, one of the most important and currently 
              unanswered questions is what is the relative contribution of  individual P450
              genes to resistance? The experiments  included in this proposal will
              investigate this question and  will significantly contribute to our
              understanding of the  mechanisms by which insects evolve P450-mediated
              resistance.  This objective represents a major advancement in the areas  of
              insect ecological genetics and evolution.
