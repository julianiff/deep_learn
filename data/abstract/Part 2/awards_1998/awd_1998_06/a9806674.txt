Abstract    :
              Coley    98 06674    Factors controlling the magnitude of herbivory in tropical
              forests have been of interest to ecologists for a long time.  It has generally
              been thought that the magnitude of herbivory is controlled by limits on overall
              herbivore biomass by the quality and quantity of suitable leaf materials for
              food.  The author of this proposal has suggested, however, that the standing
              biomass of herbivores is influenced by control by higher trophic levels.  This
              project is taking advantage of an unusual climatic event to test this
              hypothesis of top-down control.    This years upcoming ENSO event is
              anticipated to be the strongest one in some time.  It is likely to cause
              conditions that generate a differential stress on the consumers of herbivores
              relative to that on the herbivores themselves.  This project would test for
              such an effect and for the increase in herbivores that would be predicted in
              response to a decline in its consumers.  It would allow a direct test of the
              top-down control hypothesis in tropical forests.
