A program to study the structure of classical stellar
              novae ejecta will be carried out.  Novae ejecta are generally modeled as
              spherically symmetric shells, but observations of shells around old novae show
              that few, if any, are spherically symmetric. A large database of optical
              spectropolarimetry of Nova Cas 1995 has been obtained that has shown that this
              nova's ejecta had an aspherical structure soon after discovery. High-resolution
              spectra of Nova Cas 1995, which has recently entered the nebular stage, will be
              obtained at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope.  The preliminary
              analysis of high-resolution spectra showed that emission lines of different
              atomic species have different line profiles.  These atomic species exhibited
              distinct polarimetric behavior: polarization changes that were apparent in the
              spectra of hydrogen lines were not visible in the spectra of helium lines.  The
              combination of these datasets implies that the hydrogen and helium lines that
              are observed arise from separate regions of the ejecta.  The new data obtained
              will allow the further tracing of  the development of the structure  observed
              early in the outburst of this slow nova, allowing one to build a 3-dimensional
              picture of the ejecta geometry.  The results of the modeling will have
              consequences for researchers who model the ejecta of classical novae and
              additionally, for those who study the formation of outflow nebulae around other
              objects such as bipolar planetary nebulae.

The additional observations
              required for this project will be obtained in the coming year.  This POWRE
              award will make it possible to finish the reduction and analysis of the
              spectroscopic observations, and to complete the analysis of the
              spectropolarimetry.  Graduate students will be employed to assist in the
              reduction, data analysis, and observations.  The student will gain valuable
              experience in a variety of astronomical techniques that will be of use in any
              future research career.

The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
