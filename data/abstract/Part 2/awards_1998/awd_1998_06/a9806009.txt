Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded through the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) supports the research and educational
              activities of Dr. Marin Robinson of Northern Arizona University.  The research
              involves a pilot program to monitor particulate matter in Flagstaff, AZ to
              analyze the chemical composition of wood smoke collected during prescribed
              burns of Flagstaff's Coconino National Forest and to evaluate the need for a
              permanent sampling station in Flagstaff.  Portable saturation samplers will be
              used to monitor fine and larger particulate matter (PM-2.5/10) at six
              pre-selected sites in Flagstaff during high and low wood-burning periods as
              well as during prescribed burns in the national forest.  The particulates will
              be analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometry.

The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will
              enhance Dr. Robinson's research potential as well as her ultimate goal of the
              educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists
              in both classroom and research laboratory.   The proposed research program will
              use students to sample, compile, and analyze the data in class projects.  The
              results of these studies should help determine whether Flagstaff, AZ exceeds
              National Air Quality Standards for certain air-borne particulates.
