Abstract    :
              Clark  DEB-9806584    The grasses are economically and ecologically extremely
              important plants.  Not only does this family include major world crops such as
              wheat, rice, maize, barley, sugar cane, and bamboo, but the grasses also occur
              in virtually all terrestrial habitats.  An understanding of the evolutionary
              relationships among the different groups of grasses provides a fundamental
              framework for research in many fields, including biodiversity, genetics,
              development, molecular biology, and crop improvement.  The Grass Phylogeny
              Working Group (GPWG), consisting of 12 grass taxonomists, was formed in 1996 to
              analyze a number of different, recently available data sets that contain
              information about evolutionary relationships among grasses.  The results of
              this analysis, along with an updated classification of the grass family based
              on their evolutionary relationships, will be presented at the Third
              International Grass Symposium to be held in Sydney, Australia, in September,
              1998 in conjunction with the Second International Conference on the Comparative
              Biology of the Monocotyledons.  The funding provided will support travel by ten
              of the U. S. members of the GPWG, including junior investigators and a graduate
              student, to attend this meeting and to present and discuss the results of this
              collaborative effort.
