Abstract    :
              Rieseberg   9806290         One of the most exciting recent advances in biology
              has been the ability to   generate detailed genetic maps for almost any plant
              or animal species. These   maps not only are essential for isolating genes of
              interest, but they also   can be used to study important questions in
              population biology such as how   new species are formed.  The purpose of this
              grant is to develop genetic   linkage maps for three wild sunflower species
              that are products of   hybridization between two other sunflower species. By
              comparing the genetic   maps of the hybrid species and their parents, it will
              be possible to   determine exactly what genetic changes are necessary for
              hybrid speciation   to occur and to estimate how rapidly this process might
              take place.         The primary outcome of this work will be a more predictive
              theory of hybrid   speciation.  However, the genetic maps generated by this
              research are likely   to be useful to researchers in a variety of fields
              ranging from ecology to   agriculture.  This is because the wild sunflowers to
              be investigated are   characterized by adaptations such as drought and saline
              tolerance that are   of interest to both ecologists and plant breeders.  The
              maps generated by   this proposal can be used to elucidate the genomic location
              and genetic   basis of these adaptations and to facilitate their transfer to
              the   cultivated sunflower.  In addition, novel analytical methods developed to
                analyze the sunflower mapping data should be broadly applicable to any data  
              set that involves genetic linkage analyses.
