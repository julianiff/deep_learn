Abstract    :
              The proposed research program will use both nalytical and computational analyses
              to examine the processes of ion acceleration in the auroral zones.  Satellite
              observations have indicated the possible existence of a number of nonlinear
              phenomena that can result in the energization of ions by electrostatic waves. 
              The proposed study will attempt to model the energization processes from the
              ionosphere to the magnetosphere.
