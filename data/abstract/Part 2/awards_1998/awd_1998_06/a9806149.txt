Abstract    :
              Research conducted under this grant is funded by the POWRE Program. 
              Ground-based observations of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)
              regions are cross-matched with satellite airglow data to identify coincident
              measurement incidents at common locations.  Next, coincident measurements are
              analyzed in case studies to develop methods for comparisons across disparate
              data types, as well as identifying meaningful aspects of the matched data
              worthy of more detailed analyses.  The research will benefit both ground-based
              and satellite research communities.
