The GLOBEC Georges Bank field study concludes in late 1999.
              As part of this effort, Dr. Brink and collaborators will have collected five
              years worth of physical measurements involving moored observations, drifters
              and shipboard ADCPs (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers).  This project will
              include telemetry of optical data from an existing mooring. The main part of
              this study is to cover analysis of this large data set.  They will use moored
              measurements to characterize the water properties (flow, hydrographic and
              biological) and important driving agents,  and they will use drifters to
              understand dispersion, residence times and frontal processes.  Historical
              hydrographic data will allow them to understand the historical
              representativeness of the GBS field period.  ADCP data will allow the
              characterization of Bank-wide flow patterns and their seasonal evolution.
              Finally, the physical knowledge base will help to answer interdisciplinary
              questions about how physical processes (which might be somewhat predictable
              through climate models) influence variations in biological recruitment.
