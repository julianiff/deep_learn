Frontal exchange processes over eastern Georges Bank and
              the adjacent Northeast Channel-Browns Bank region will be investigated using a
              combination of field work and modeling. The field work features moored array
              measurements, Lagrangian. drifter observations, and several physical/biological
              surveys, and will focus on the winter-spring period when cross-front transport
              of water and biota, especially Calanus finmarchicus from the Gulf of Maine
              across the northern flank frontal system (NF'FS) and larval cod and copepods
              via Scotian Shelf Water cross-overs, are thought to be most critical for the
              survival and recruitment of the target species on Georges Bank. The model work
              will be directed towards an improved description and understanding of the NFFS
              and other fronts over the eastern end of the Bank with a focus on the
              mechanisms for transport of water, nutrients and biota from the Gulf of Maine
              and the Scotian Shelf to the Northeast Peak and southernflank of Georges Bank.
              Comprehensive analysis of the observational and model results will lead to new
              understanding and insight into the physical processes driving frontal exchange
              over eastern Georges Bank and their biological consequences.
