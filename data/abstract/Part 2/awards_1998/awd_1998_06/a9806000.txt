Abstract    :
              9806000  Sharma  This research addresses the thermodynamics, kinetics, reaction 
              path, structure and composition of intermediate phases, atomic  level
              structural mechanism of the reaction of Zr containing  compounds with N2 and
              NH3. In situ x-ray diffraction studies will  be conducted at the University of
              Tubingen, and transmission  electron microscopy at Arizona State University.
              The approach is  to synthesize zirconia phase(s) with randomly ordered oxygen 
              vacancies by anion (N for O) substitution. Most of the studies of  zirconia
              stabilization are concentrated on cation substitution,  preferably by a lower
              valent ion such Y or Ca, to create randomly  ordered oxygen vacancies. Some
              zirconium oxynitride with ordered  oxygen vacancies in the lattice have been
              synthesized, but  randomly ordered vacancies are required for a material to be
              used  in solid oxide fuel cells. The present project is directed  towards a
              preliminary study that will lead to a detailed  systematic investigation of the
              Zr-O-N system. Various Zr  containing compounds such as ZrO2, Zr(SO4)2,
              Zr(OH)4,  Zr(NO3)4.6H20, ZrOCl2 and (NH4)3ZrF7 will be heated in a N2 or  NH3
              atmosphere, and time, temperature resolved x-ray diffraction,  electron
              diffraction, high resolution electron microscopy and  electron energy loss
              spectroscopy will be used to elucidate the  reaction path and identify all
              phases.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional 
              Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The
              research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a fundamental
              level. Progress in understanding the  reaction path is expected to advance the
              potential to synthesize  technological important materials by design.
