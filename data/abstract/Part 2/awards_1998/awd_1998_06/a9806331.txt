Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of tandem reaction   sequences for
              the simultaneous production of several C-C bonds.  Tandem  
              Pummerer/Diels-Alder, 2-aminofuran cycloadditions, and vinylogous and   tandem
              Pummerer processes will be studied as entries into complex   polycyclic ring
              systems.  With this renewal award, the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Albert  Padwa of the Department of
              Chemistry at Emory University.  Professor  Padwa will focus his work on the
              develoment of tandem cascade reactions   for the preparation of unusual
              polycyclic ring systems. The goal is to   provide a general framework for
              understanding the important factors for   various cascade processes and for
              applying the sequence of reactions to   interesting synthetic targets.
