Abstract    :
              9806351  Harrison    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a dissertation 
              enhancement project involving Mr. Emilio M. Bruna of the  University of
              California, Davis, under the supervision of  Drs. Susan Harrison and Sharon Y.
              Strauss.  The title of  this project is "Effect of Habitat Fragmentation on the
               Reproduction and Population Dynamics of a Neotropical Herb  (Heliconia
              acuminata)." Fieldwork will be done at the  Biological Dynamics of Forest
              Fragments Project (BDFFP),  administered by the Smithsonian Institution and the
              National  Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA).  The BDFFP is a  large scale,
              experimental project designed specifically to  study the effects of
              fragmentation in the tropics.    Mr. Bruna will test the hypothesis that an
              observed pattern  of reduced density in habitat fragments of the neotropical 
              herb Heliconia acuminata is the result of lower population  growth rate in
              habitat fragments, due to reduced levels of  pollination, seed production, and
              seedling establishment. He  will test this by determining, via a series of
              manipulative  experiments, how and why reproductive success in H.  acuminata
              varies, by monitoring long-term demographic plots  in continuous forest and
              habitat fragments and, by  incorporating these data into a matrix model to
              predict  population dynamics.  ***
