Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Northwest Greenland Photograph Identification Project    This
              project will collect information about individuals in photographs taken between
              1908 and 1954 by Donald B. MacMillan in the Thule district of Northwest
              Greenland, now in the collections of the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum.  The
              project will focus on identifying individuals and establishing ties to their
              descendants.  Information about the location of individuals at important points
              of their lives (birth, marriage, childbirth, death) will be collected.  The
              project will also increase local access to the historic photographs of the
              community, through museum exhibitions and publications.  To this end, an
              exhibit of the photographs will be produced in collaboration with the Thule
              Museum of Qaanaaq.  While this study is focused on answering basic questions
              about people in the photographs, one ultimate goal of the project is to begin
              to make use of the collection and information for further anthropological and
              ethnohistoric work.
