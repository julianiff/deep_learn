Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Dr. Sandra Laursen of
              Kalamazoo College.  The research aims to understand tropospheric ozone
              formation by photooxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons.  In a two-phase
              laboratory study Laursen will identify primary reaction channels in the
              photolysis of two carbonyl compounds produced as intermediates in atmospheric
              photochemical ozone production.  Chemical analysis of photoproducts and laser
              spectroscopy will be used to characterize atmospherically relevant
              radical-species reactions.

The opportunity afforded through the POWRE
              program will enhance Dr. Laursen's research potential as well as her ultimate
              goal of the educational mentoring of undergraduate students in both classroom
              and research laboratory.   This project concerns a timely topic and represents
              a new direction for Laursen.  Her investigations will shed light on processes
              which form and destroy ozone and could ultimately help understand how to
              alleviate human health problems and economic losses to crops, forests, and
              building materials that are caused by ozone.
