The objective of this research is to construct and
              characterize two new probes to be used in surgery for the detection of brain
              tumor tissue (surface probe) and pre-cancerous tissue in the ovary (endoscopic
              probe).  The feasibility of the probe design will be evaluated using a tabletop
              experimental system and standard materials.  Final probes will be tested in
              vivo using an appropriate animal model.  This research is appropriate for the
              POWRE program because it will permit the principal investigator to establish an
              independent research program following a maternity leave of absence for 6
              months before starting her position as a research associate.
