Abstract    :
              9806141  Gobert    This research examines student learning in the domain of
              plate tectonics, as one domain representative of a difficult, causally complex
              domain encountered in middle school.  A pilot study, which addressed the nature
              of students' pre-instruction models lead to the development of a typology of
              models, observed in middle school.  These range from spatially incorrect models
              to causally complex models, which integrate multiple heat-related mechanisms
              (i.e., heated core, and convection currents forming), and movement-related
              mechanisms (currents pushing on the plates plates moving apart, etc.).  The
              results of two empirical studies suggest that multiple inference tasks (i.e.,
              diagram-based and explanation-based) could be used to promote model
              construction and revision.  The goal of the present research is to identify
              modality-specific learning processes in each condition, namely, the
              diagram-construct and explanation-construct learning conditions.  The findings,
              along with those from previous pilot data will be used to identify and refine a
              set of the earth and promoting the development of rich, integrated mental
              models.  This approach to science, which emphasizes models and modeling tasks,
              recognizes the need to develop process skills such as model building in order
              to promote lifelong learning and scientific literacy.  ***
