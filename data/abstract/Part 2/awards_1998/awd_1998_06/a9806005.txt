POWRE-CISE:  Smart Antennas for Wireless Communication   

This research
              is a new thrust for the PI and will allow her to lead, for the first time, an
              experimental effort in the area of wireless communications.  The research
              merges experimental and theoretical tasks.  The experimental part of the work
              incorporates completion of an eight-channel smart antenna testbed. The
              theoretical part of the work aims at determining the feasibility of a new line
              of inquiry in the area of wireless communications. The emphasis is on the
              application of two-stage rank reduction of various problems in wireless
              communications.
