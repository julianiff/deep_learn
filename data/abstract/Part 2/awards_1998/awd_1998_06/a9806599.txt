Abstract    :
              Roy Van Driesche  University of Massachusetts  DEB-9806599  "Range Reductions in
              Native Butterfly, ..."                                                         
                                                  Conservation plans for native butterflies
              have usually focused on habitat loss as the primary driver of changes in
              distribution.  It is also possible that native butterflies can be reduced in
              their population by parasitoids that have been introduced for biological
              control of other species.  This proposal investigates the reasons behind range
              reductions for a native butterfly and specifically tests alternative hypotheses
              concerning host plant reductions and/or an introduced parasite.  It would
              investigate a native pierid butterfly in Mass. as well as a related species
              that invaded more than one hundred years ago.  Both butterflies may be
              influenced by a braconid wasp that invaded with the non-native butterfly but
              which has also been released as a biological control agent.  This work can
              provide insights into basic questions on the ecology of shared parasitoids in
              insect communities and some of the consequences of biological control efforts.
