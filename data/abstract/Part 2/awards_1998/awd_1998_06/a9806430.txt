Abstract    :
              9806430  Feng      This is a 12-month award proposed by Dr. Zhaodong Feng, 
              Montclair State College.  Dr. Feng requests funds for a planning visit to
              Mongolia to  collect data on the Eolian linkage in climate between the 
              Mongolia and the Chinese loess plateaus.  He plans to use  this information to
              prepare a research proposal for studying  climate history in northern Mongolia.
               Dr. Feng is a young  investigator studying in a remote area which has limited 
              available data, but which is important for paleoclimate  research.  This
              project addresses two major INT focus areas:  a unique site in an important
              geophysical  area with limited  data, and contributing to human resource
              development.
