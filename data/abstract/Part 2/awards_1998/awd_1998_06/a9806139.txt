              Material Models for Computer Graphics    Realistic image synthesis is one of
              the most fundamental problems in computer graphics with a wide variety of
              applications.  An important component that has been missing from image
              synthesis is the effect of weathering.  Existing models of materials in
              computer graphics assume that the materials are in pristine condition, which is
              rarely the case.  This research program focuses on the development of computer
              graphics models for   materials, which will be suitable for the requirements of
              image synthesis. The research will address three critical aspects of this
              problem: (1) Taxonomy of materials --a study of a variety of materials will be
              conducted in order to devise a classification of materials that is specific to
              computer graphics. (2) Models for materials -- new material models will be
              developed, which will be capable of sustaining a range of appearances. (3)
              Assemblies of objects and materials -- data structures will be devised to
              handle intricate assemblies of complex geometries and materials.  The
              postdoctoral associate will play a key role in the formative stages of the
              development of the new computer graphics research group at MIT.  The associate
              will bring expertise in modeling and texturing, will collaborate with faculty
              on research projects, and will provide leadership for student research.
