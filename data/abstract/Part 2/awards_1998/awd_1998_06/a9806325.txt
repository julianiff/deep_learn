Abstract    :
              Abstract  Grigoropoulos      Funds are awarded to purchase a femtosecond laser. 
              This laser will be used to investigate ultra-short energy transfer in metals,
              semiconductors, insulators, and liquids.  The work will be focussed on the
              understanding and quantification of the laser energy coupling to the irradiated
              target material.  This requires proper account of the microscopic mechanisms of
              energy transfer that cannot be provided in the continuum heat transfer
              framework under the equilibrium assumptions.  In addition, the femtosecond
              laser will be used to study the mechanisms of electronic desorption from metal
              and semiconductor surfaces.  This topic is of particular importance to many
              applications, including the removal of residual moisture from sensitive
              micro-electronics and micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) device surfaces.
