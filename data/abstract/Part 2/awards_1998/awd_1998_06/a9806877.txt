Abstract    :
              Clark  DEB-9806877    The true bamboos are a diverse group of grasses with
              worldwide distribution, including at least 1,200 species of both woody and
              herbaceous (non-woody) members.   The bulk of bamboo diversity is found among
              the woody bamboos, which includes 1,100 species occurring as characteristic
              elements of both tropical and temperate forests.   Due to their structural
              complexity and long intervals of growth without flowering (40, 60, or 80 or
              more years in some cases), the woody bamboos remain understudied compared to
              other grasses.  Molecular data have provided some clues to evolutionary
              relationships among woody bamboos, but an apparently slower rate of mutation
              relative to other grasses has prevented more detailed analyses of this group. 
              Available data for anatomy and whole plant structure of bamboos provide
              indications of ancestry among woody bamboos that conflict with those derived
              from molecular data.  The principal objective of this research is to examine
              this conflict in the determinate, one-flowered woody bamboos by conducting
              detailed structural analyses to obtain a better estimate of evolutionary
              relationships.  As part of this research, a taxonomic study of the most
              primitive members of Chusquea, the most diverse genus of this subset of woody
              bamboos, will be completed.  The results of this project will provide the
              foundation for a broader evolutionary study and reclassification of the woody
              bamboos.
