This award provides funds to partially support a research
              conference in high dimensional probability to be held at the University of
              Washington, August 1-9, 1999.  The purpose of the conference is to bring
              together analysts, probabilists, and statisticians with interests in this area
              of research.  This is currently a very active area of research in probability,
              which is demonstrating its relevance to applications in statistics, other areas
              of probability, and to problems in physical science.
