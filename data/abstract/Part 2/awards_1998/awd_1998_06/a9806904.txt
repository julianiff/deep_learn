Abstract    :
              9806904  Ramm    This Americas Program award will help to support an 
              international conference on operator theory and applications  in Winnipeg.
              Canada.  Professor Alexander Ramm of Kansas  State University and Professor A.
              Strauss of the University  of Ulyanovsk, Russia are the co-chairs of the
              Program  Committee, and with Professor P. N. Shivakumar, Director of  the
              Canadian Institute of Industrial Mathematical Sciences  (IIMS) and chair of the
              local organizing committee, are the  principal organizers of the conference. 
              The activity will  bring together leading experts to cover a broad range of 
              topics in operator theory and its applications to scientific  and industrial
              problems, financial mathematics and  biomathematics.    The conference is the
              second in a quadrennial series of  international meetings dedicated to operator
              theory and its  applications.  While the designated speakers are  international
              authorities on diverse areas of mathematics  and reflect the broad impact of
              operator theory, the  conference organizers plan to invite graduate students
              and  young researchers to enhance the educational value of the  meeting. 
              Because of the high quality and international  diversity of the participants,
              support for this conference  is being jointly shared with the Eastern Europe
              Program of  the Division of International Programs and with the Division  of
              Mathematical Sciences.  An expected outcome of this  workshop will be a report
              on the current status and future  directions for the field of operator theory.
