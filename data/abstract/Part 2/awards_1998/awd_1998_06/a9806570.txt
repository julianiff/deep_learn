Abstract    :
              Kim  9806570      Abstract   Dr. Kim's proposed  project will investigate the
              scaling properties of phylogenetic reconstruction methods under various models
              of tree evolution and investigate how such information can be used to design
              the most powerful and efficient strategies for analyzing large scale
              phylogenies.  The study addresses fundamental and controversial questions of
              concern to all evolutionary biologists; in fact the difficulty surrounding
              choice of tree model in light of taxon sampling currently is an intractable
              problem for most biologists who do phylogenetic reconstructions.   The PI will
              study three clearly justified stochastic tree evolution models, three models of
              character evolution, and four different taxon sampling strategies.  The study
              also could have broad sociological implications for the scientific environment
              if it clearly resolved questions these surrounding controversial issues.  The
              study will help to provide answers to fundamental questions raised by
              systematic biologists.
