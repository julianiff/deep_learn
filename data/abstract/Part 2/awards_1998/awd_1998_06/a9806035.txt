Abstract    :
                    9806035  Page  In this project funded by the POWRE program, Dr. Page will
              use the testis as the ideal organ for exploring the complex interactions known
              to exist between glucocorticoids and the protooncogene family of
              transcriptional regulators, Fos and Jun.  Glucocorticoids have been shown to
              depress plasma testosterone by inhibiting Leydig cell biosynthesis.  Results
              from these studies will be employed to design experiments that will examine the
              mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid regulatory pathways
