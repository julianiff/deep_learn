Abstract    :
              The broad goal of this project is to develop algorithms and  software for
              modeling the binding of a protein molecule with  the molecule to which it
              attaches (ligand).  Given the 3-D  structures of the receptor and the ligand,
              rapid and  reliable computational methods to locate the binding sites  and
              predict the geometry of the complex will be developed.  The first specific goal
              will be to adapt existing Fast  Fourier Transform algorithms developed for the
              translational  searches to use free energy targets for improved predictive 
              reliability.  The second goal is to develop Fast Fourier  Transform methods for
              rotational searches as well.  Finally,  the methods will be tested and
              benchmarked on a database of  protein complexes.    Based on the outcome, the
              database along with the algorithms  will be will be made available via the
              World Wide Web.  For  researchers who submit monomeric data, the web server
              will  run the parallel version of the FFT docking algorithms on  the
              supercomputers in the Center for Computational Science  at Boston University.
