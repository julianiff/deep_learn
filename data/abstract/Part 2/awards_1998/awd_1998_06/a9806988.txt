Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at New
              York University involves an ethnographic study of how a recent grassroots
              African-American social movement for environmental justice in Augusta, Georgia
              has appropriated the discourse of the mainstream environmental movement and
              redefined it as issues of social justice.  For environmental justice activists,
              `rights` includes access to toxin-free air and water as well as housing,
              schools and workplaces, all free of race and class discrimination.  Through
              participant observation, a survey of local residents, interviews and archival
              research the student will test the proposition that local perceptions of racial
              discrimination are dominant over class or politics as perceived causes of
              environmental pollution.  This project thus investigates the long-term impact
              of the civil rights movement on African Americans in this representative local
              Southern community.  It will advance our understanding of contemporary civil
              society and grassroots movements by showing how rhetoric and issues flow across
              social lines to galvanize action on environmental issues.
