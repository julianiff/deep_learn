The goal of this research is to develop a model for bipedal
              motion which uses little or no active motion.  Rather, locomotion is modeled
              via a strictly passive motion similar to those walking toys that walk down an
              incline.  The model would be advantageous because it reduces the number of free
              parameters to that of the ground slope.  Simulation results were presented
              which demonstrate that the model undergoes stable period doubling limit cycles
              leading ultimately to chaos, which resembles normal gait, limping, and
              seemingly chaotic stumbling, respectively.  A close agreement was found to
              exist between strobe line drawings obtained from a passive kneed model and
              human subject data.  The research seeks to expand on three-dimensional models,
              generate more realistic two-dimensional models, incorporate upper body, and
              other body parts, look at powered walking, running and pathological
              gait.
