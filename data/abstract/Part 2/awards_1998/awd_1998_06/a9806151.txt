Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Professor Robin
              Garrell of the University of California at Los Angeles.  The research aims to
              extend the techniques currently existing in her laboratory to a new area, the
              study of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).  Boranes and carboranes, such as
              boranethiols and carborod derivatives, will be used as the basis for new types
              of SAMs on noble metal and oxide surfaces.  The topology, adsorbate-surface
              interactions, and stability will be examined using various analytical
              techniques as well as quantum-mechanical calculations.

The opportunity
              afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor Garrell's research
              potential as well as her educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and
              postdoctoral scientists.  Her investigations of these borane-based
              self-assembled monolayers can serve as models for adhesion, wetting, and other
              interfacial processes.  This work could ultimately benefit the manufacture of
              electronics, sensors, and thin-film coatings.
