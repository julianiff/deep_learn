Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9806321  Estella Blaisten-Barojas, George Mason University     It
              was observed that an inorganic precipitate (Dogtooth Spar) absorbed at the
              air-water interface bifurcates into two aggregation structures.  One structure
              develops into a two-dimensional fractal gel previously identified in
              literature, and another self-organizes into a two-dimensional colloidal
              periodic structure (lattice) of crystals that was observed for the first time
              by the P.I.  The new crystals have a distorted tetrahedral shape, do not
              aggregate, and spontaneously may arrange into the periodic structure.  The main
              focus of the project is the clarification of the conditions under which
              self-organization occurs, characterize the crystals formed at the air-water
              interface, and understanding the role of crystallites in the respective fractal
              growth at the air-water interface.  The P.I. proposed an initial model that
              includes the repulsive electrostatic forces and attractive capillary forces. 
              If this model is true, then the observed self-organization could be achieved in
              other systems.   Video microscopy and crystal interaction models will be used
              in the investigation.     If successful, the project will clarify a
              self-organizing mechanism with relevance to colloidal science and materials
              synthesis.  ***
