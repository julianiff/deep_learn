This project will continue the acquisition and archiving of
              polar orbiting satellite images of the antarctic environment by the Arctic and
              Antarctic Research Center (AARC) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for
              three years.

Satellite tracking facilities have been established by the AARC
              at McMurdo and Palmer Station, Antarctica, which record and archive images from
              the NOAA series of polar orbiting satellites and from the Department of Defense
              DMSP series of satellites.  The AARC presently maintains an archive of more
              than 6000 data tapes, and the regional coverage includes all of Antarctica and
              much of the Southern Ocean.  These data are used are used to support such
              antarctic operational activities as the navigation of research vessels in
              antarctic waters and weather  forecasting for air operations, as well as the
              geophysical and environmental research projects of polar scientists
              worldwide.
