Abstract    :
              Abstract    98-06466  Findlay    Hyporheic microbial response to variations in
              supply of dissolved organic carbon    Microbes are responsible for many
              important transformations of organic materials in aquatic ecosystems and their
              activity varies dramatically among ecosystems and among habitats within
              ecosystems. This project will examine whether differences in bacterial
              consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream sediments are
              accompanied by shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial species. In some
              streams there are large declines in DOC as water moves along subsurface
              flowpaths and these declines are accompanied by significant drops in bacterial
              abundance, growth and shifts in allocation among carbon-acquiring extracellular
              enzymes.  We will use DNA-DNA hybridization to reveal the degree of similarity
              among streams and along flowpaths. Our experiments will use water from streams
              known to vary in subsurface DOC patterns. This range in variability will be
              augmented with additions of specific classes of compounds (e.g. humic acids)
              expected to result in large differences in microbial activity. Our access to
              well-defined gradients in microbial function permits a powerful test of the
              potential link between function and structure in microbial communities.
