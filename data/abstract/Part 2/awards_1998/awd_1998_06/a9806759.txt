Abstract    :
              Abstract    OPP-9806759  Hammer, Michael  Karafet, Tatiana  University of
              Arizona      Within genetics, the study of lineages that are inherited
              maternally (mtDNA), paternally (Y chromosomes), or biparentally, can offer
              different insights into human history.  This project focuses on the
              non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome in Asian populations to shed light
              on ancient migrations within Asia and movements to the rest of the world.  The
              investigators will continue Y chromosome surveys in 14 native Siberian
              populations and perform the first detailed study of genetic variation in 12
              indigenous Mongolian groups.  Y chromosome data will also be collected from 14
              West-Central Asian, East Asian, and North-Central Chinese populations.  In
              combination with similar global data, this information will be used to (1)
              construct Y chromosome haplotypes; (2) measure levels of intra- and inter-group
              components of variation; (3) establish genetic relationships among these
              populations from the perspective of male lineages; (4) build a phylogenetic
              tree that shows how contemporary Y haplotypes evolved from ancestral ones; (5)
              estimate the time to the most recent common ancestral Y chromosome and the ages
              of individual mutations in the haplotype tree; and (6) perform statistical
              tests to identify associations between haplotypes and geography.  The combined
              data will be used to address a number of hypotheses regarding the chronology of
              the initial peopling of northern Asia, the nature of its ancient human
              populations, the origins and migration patterns from Asia to Europe and the New
              World, and an Asian back-to-Africa migration.
