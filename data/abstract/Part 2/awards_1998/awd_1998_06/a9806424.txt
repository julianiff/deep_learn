Abstract    :
              Riemann Surfaces, Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry-C. McMullen  DMS-9806424 
              This project will study the classification of geometric structures and
              dynamical systems, in settings that allow for a concerted study of specific
              examples.  Its scope includes iterated rational maps, Kleinian groups,
              projective structures on Riemann surfaces, and algebraic dynamics on the
              projective plane.  Renormalization, the interaction of spectral theory with
              complex dynamics, and applications of Teichmuller theory to 3-manifolds are
              among the main research directions.  From meteorology to robotics, the control
              and prediction of dynamical systems plays a central role in science and
              technology.  This project will include computer explorations of mathematically
              simple systems that exhibit rich combinatorial structure and universal analytic
              features.  Its aim is to advance the theoretical understanding of dynamics and
              geometry.
