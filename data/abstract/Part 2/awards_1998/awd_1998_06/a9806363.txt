The balance between speciation and extinction determines the
              biological diversity existing on earth at any time.  Thousands of animal and
              plant species around the world are now threatened with premature extinction by
              human activities, especially habitat destruction and fragmentation,
              overexploitation, and introduction of exotic species.  Because of the
              complexity of the processes involved, mathematical models and computer
              simulations are necessary to assess the relative importance and interactions of
              different factors affecting extinction risks.  

This proposal concerns
              models of several demographic and genetic factors affecting the risk of
              population extinction, with emphasis on random factors operating in small and
              spatially distributed populations, and in communities of interacting species.  
              Formulas for probabilities and times of extinction will be derived and computer
              simulations performed to understand the importance of various risk factors and
              their interactions.  The results of this investigation will help in the
              assessment of extinction risks and the development of management plans for
              threatened and endangered species.  The synthesis of realistic models of
              demographic and genetic processes in small and spatially distributed
              populations is an area in which conservation biology can contribute to
              fundamental advances at the interface of ecology and evolution.
