Abstract    :
              9806228 Ramaswami The objective of this research is to examine vegetation as a
              potentially important factor controlling transport and transformations of
              Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in the natural environment. While the gasoline
              additive MTBE has been effective in reducing air polluting emissions from
              automobiles, its presence has been detected in groundwater and surface waters
              across the nation. It is apparent that point source contamination does not
              explain the observations and that non-point deposition of atmospheric MTBE is
              suggested. Vegetation is thought to play a role in both the transport and the
              transformation of MTBE. It is the aim of this research to understand that role,
              with the following objectives: 1) examine potential vegetation-induced pathways
              for transfer of MTBE between the atmosphere and bodies of water, including the
              transpiration from groundwater to air, as well as foliar uptake of air-borne
              MTBE, 2) assess the fate of MTBE as it moves through the plant and determine
              enhanced microbial degradation of MTBE in the plant rhizosphere and 3) assess
              the above factors and incorporate them into mathematical models that describe
              the fate and transport of MTBE between the atmosphere and groundwater systems.
              The knowledge gained may be applied toward development of integrated models to
              describe  the impact of MTBE on the environment and to the development of
              plant-based phytoremediation systems for groundwater treatment. This new line
              of inquiry for the PI draws on her work with Se phytoremediation and MTBE
              transport and provides the potential for her to become a leader in this area of
              research.
