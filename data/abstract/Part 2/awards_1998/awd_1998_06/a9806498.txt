Abstract    :
              U.S. GLOBEC: Water-Mass Exchange across the Tidal Mixing Front over Southern
              Georges Bank and Its Impact on Larval Fish and Zooplankton
              Populations


This project will focus on water mass exchange and mixing
              across the tidal mixing front over Georges Bank and the impact these processes
              have on larval fish and zooplankton populations.  As part of the project, a
              series of field studies will be carried out in the region of the tidal mixing
              front over the northeast peak and southern flank during May-June 1999.  These
              studies will include dye and drifter tracking as well as ADCP, CTD, and video
              plankton recorder (VPR) surveys.  In addition, the investigators will use a
              diagnostic model to explore how differences in near-frontal motions and mixing
              rates influence larval and zooplankton movement. The field data will be
              analyzed to (1)  resolve the 3-dimensional circulation and zooplankton
              population field in the region of the tidal mixing front, (2) to identify
              regions of convergence onto the front, (3)  to quantify rates of convergence
              and cross-frontal exchange of both water and zooplankton, (4)  to quantify
              diapycnal and isopycnal mixing rates in the frontal region, and (5)  to examine
              zooplankton swimming behavior in relation to various conditions of
              stratification, flow, and vertical mixing rate.
