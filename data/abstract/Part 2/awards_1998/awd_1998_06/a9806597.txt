The Gordon Conference on "Research at High Pressure",
              which will take place June 21-26, 1998, is one of the longest standing of all
              Gordon Conferences, having been first held in August 1955 at the site of the
              upcoming conference.  The secret of this conference's vitality is that it has
              served as a forum for topics at the forefront of both static and shock-wave
              high-pressure research in many diverse areas, including Physics, Chemistry,
              Astrophysics, and the Geosciences.  The topics of the upcoming conference
              include:  Life under Extreme Conditions; Materials Synthesis at High
              Temperatures/Pressures; Superconductivity under Extreme
Pressures; Properties
              of Hydrogen and Other Molecular Solids at Extreme Densities; Unsolved Questions
              in the Material Properties of Planetary Interiors; Volume Effects in Colossal
              Magnetoresistance Compounds; 
Strongly Correlated Electron systems; Recent
              Developments in Geochemistry and Geophysics.  The conference will include
              presentations from 23 distinguished invited speakers and more than 75 poster
              contributions.
