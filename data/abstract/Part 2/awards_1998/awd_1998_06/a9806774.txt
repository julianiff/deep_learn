Abstract    :
              9806774  Khosla  The overall goal of this project is to use the multi-enzyme
              polyketide synthases (PKSs) for catalyzing the enzymatic synthesis of
              polyketides using simple commercially available building blocks.  Three major
              obstacles need to be overcome in order to accomplish this goal.  1) An
              inexpensive source of the component enzymes needs to be developed.  Solutions
              to this problem will primarily rely on the power of recombinant DNA methods. 
              2) The stability of the PKSs must be maximized without significantly impacting
              quality with respect to turnover parameters and selectivity.  This is to be
              accomplished through a combination of protein purification, optimization of
              reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, and buffer composition), and
              protein immobilization.  3) An inexpensive source of substrates needs to be
              developed.  Since PKSs utilize expensive cofactors such as NAD (P) H and CoA
              derivatives, this problem is to be addressed through cofactor regeneration
              and/or the development of simpler substrate mimics that can be accepted by
              PKSs.  ***
