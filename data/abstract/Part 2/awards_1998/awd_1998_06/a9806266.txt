Abstract    :
              DEB - 9806266  Robert A. Garrott and L. Lee Eberhardt    Large predators are
              increasingly being re-introduced into areas from which they have been
              extirpated.  This is a conservation strategy that is being advocated in a wide
              array of regions.  The effects of such introductions are poorly understood,
              however.  Much theoretical work has been conducted on such systems but this has
              been matched with little empirical documentation. This proposal requests funds
              to assess the effects of wolf re-introductions on ungulate populations in
              Yellowstone National Park where extensive data have been collected on elk
              populations in a region where wolves are about to be re-established.  Based
              upon extensive existing data, the ungulate population in this region appears to
              be stable and this provides an ideal situation to determine the effects of
              wolves on a stationary population.  Research will involve collection of
              animal-population data from within the region as well as the development of
              modeling efforts to evaluate the effects of the changes that are planned. 
              Effects on bison will also be assessed in the manipulation area and the
              proposed work involves collaborations a number of specialists on all of the
              component species in the study system.
