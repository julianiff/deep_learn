Abstract    :
              AST-9806026  Colome    A polarimeter will be adapted to a newly constructed 
              near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph, CoolSpec, which  is currently used at
              McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin. The driving design
              of CoolSpec is to utilize the existing NIR camera: ROKCAM at McDonald
              Observatory, in order to achieve both direct imaging and spectroscopy  in the
              NIR in a very cost-effective way. CoolSpec is optimized as a medium to low
              resolution long-slit spectrograph.  The polarimeter adapted to ROKCAM consists
              of two components; a cold wire grid and a warm rotatable half-wave plate.   
              The main interest for developing a NIR spectropolarimeter is to study polarized
              spectral features in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).  The instrument will be used
              to study a wide variety of astronomical objects such as proto-planetary and
              planetary nebula, supernova remnants, external galaxies and active galactic
              nuclei (AGNs).    The goals of this NIR research are the following:    (a) to
              adapt a polarimeter to a newly constructed NIR spectrometer and     (b) to
              study the spatial relationship of the molecular material, molecular hydrogen, 
              and the atomic and molecular  gas in outflow sources,     (c)  to determine the
              contribution of scattered light by dust grains to the emission lines of 
              molecular hydrogen recently detected in several outflow sources, and     (d) to
              attempt the first detection of polarization in the electromagnetic emission
              from carbon monoxide in YSOs.    This is a collaborative project with the
              University of Texas and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 
              Astronomers from Mexico will be observing at the McDonald Observatory in Texas.
                 This award is funded by the Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Astronomical Sciences.  ***
