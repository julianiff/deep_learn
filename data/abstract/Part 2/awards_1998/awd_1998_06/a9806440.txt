Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9806440    INVESTIGATOR(S) : TURNER   
              INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN     The 1998 Yellowstone fires affected
              over 250,000 ha, creating a mosaic of burn severity over the landscape that may
              influence ecosystem processes for decades or centuries to come.  This study
              will develop quantitive predictions of postfire successional pathways and their
              consequences for ecosystem function across the Yellowstone landscape. The
              principal methods to be used are mapping and monitoring of permanent plots,
              combined with sophisticated spatial analysis and measurements of leaf area and
              net primary productivity.  The focus is on variability within and among the
              major ecosystems of the Yellowstone landscape, and on variability in their
              responses to a large, common disturbance.  The study will also contribute to
              understanding of potential effects of different fire regimes resulting from
              either management or climate change.
