Abstract    :
              9806702  Calvetti    The numerical solution of image processing problems gives
              rise to very large  nonsymmetric linear systems whose solutions are extremely
              sensitive to   perturbations in the data. To avoid or at least contain the
              disastrous effects   of such instability regularization is required.
              Regularization yields slightly   modified problems which are less sensitive to
              inaccuracies in the data.    The aim of the research by the investigator and
              her colleague is to   develop effective and efficient regularization methods
              for the solution of  large nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in image
              processing applications,   as well as to develop new algorithms for image
              compression.      The new numerical methods will be tested on medical imaging
              data and will be   applied to interventional magnetic resonance imaging in
              collaboration the   department for Biomedical Engineering at Case Western
              Reserve University.
