Abstract    :
              98-06206 MELNIKOVA.  The synapses, sites at which information is  transferred
              between cells in the nervous sytem, are critical for  normal funciotning of the
              brain.  Numerous lines of evidence  suggest that the production ("expression")
              of the proteins  ("receptors") of nerve cells (neurons) which are responsible
              for  sensitivity to the messenger molecules ("neurotransmitters")  through 
              which neurons communicate is essential for proper  synapses to grow.  Thus
              understanding what regulates this receptor  expression if important for
              understanding how the nervous system  gets wired up.  Dr. Melnikova will study
              certain components  (called "subunits") of one of the more important
              neurotransmitter  receptors, that responsible for the sensitivity to the
              chemical  "acetylcholine."  She will determine which molecules inside the  cell
              ("transcriptional regulatory units") are responsible for  regulating the
              production of the receptor subunits, and how  exactly they operate within the
              cell nucleus.  This POWRE award  will promote Dr. Melnikova's career as a
              research scientist by  allowing her to learn the molecular biological
              techniques needed  for studies of gene expression, key techniques in a key area
              of  current research.
