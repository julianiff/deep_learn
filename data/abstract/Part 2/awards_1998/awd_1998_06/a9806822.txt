              Experimental Software Systems: Automated Understanding of Captured Experience  
                The objective of this research is to reduce substantially the human input
              necessary for creating and accessing large collections of multimedia,
              particularly multimedia created by capturing what is happening in an
              environment. The existing software system which is being used as the starting
              point for this investigation is Classroom 2000, a system designed to capture
              what happens in classrooms, meetings, and offices. Classroom 2000 integrates
              and synchronizes multiple streams of captured text, images, handwritten
              annotations, audio, and video. In a sense, it automates note-taking for a
              lecture or meeting. The research challenge is to make sense of this flood of
              captured data. The project explores how the output of Classroom 2000 can be
              automatically structured, segmented, indexed, and linked. Machine learning and
              statistical approaches to language are used to attempt to understand the
              captured data. Techniques from computational perception are used to try to find
              structure in the captured data. An important component of this research is the
              experimental analysis of the software system being built. The expectation is
              that this research will have a dramatic impact on how humans work and learn, as
              technology aids humans by capturing and making accessible what happens in an
              environment.
