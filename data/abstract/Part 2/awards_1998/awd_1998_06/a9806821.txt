              ESS:  An Experimental Environment for Integrating Testing and Debugging   in
              Form-Based Visual Programming Languages    Form-based visual programming
              languages (VPLs), which include commercial   spreadsheets and various research
              systems, are widely used by both   programmers and end users. Research shows,
              however, that form-based visual   programs often contain faults, and that their
              creators often express   unwarranted confidence in the reliability of their
              programs.    The goal of this research is to develop effective testing and
              debugging   methodologies for form-based VPLs. The strategy is to develop and
              implement   algorithms that combine program analysis techniques with highly
              interactive   visual techniques to support testing and debugging in form-based
              VPLs.   Experiments evaluating both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
                techniques will be conducted on various audiences programming with  
              form-based VPLs.    The widespread use of form-based VPLs makes it imperative
              that tasks such   as testing and debugging be supported in a manner suited to
              the users of   these languages; however, doing so may also yield new insights
              into ways to   facilitate testing and debugging in other kinds of end-user
              programming   environments and even in visual programming environments used by 
               professional programmers.
