Local and regional expansion of native species due to
              migration, climate change or land use offer additional opportunities to study
              patterns and effects of invasion. Ongoing, natural invasions provide model
              systems to forecast biotic movements and consequences as climate and land use
              change in the future. This grant will use paleoecological and ecological
              methods to study the ongoing invasion of Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma)
              in central and eastern Wyoming and adjacent Montana, initiated when Utah
              juniper crossed the Rocky Mountains and the Continental Divide during the late
              Holocene. This invasion can be showcased as a model system for addressing
              central issues about natural invasions because: (1) it is ongoing and has been
              proceeding for at least 2000 years, long enough to encompass both long and
              short-distance dispersal events as well as population infilling at older sites;
              (2) it can be documented at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution using
              fossil woodrat-middens, tree-ring based demographic analyses, and both ground
              and aerial repeat photography; (3) it has the potential to generate important
              hypotheses as well as provide diverse opportunities to study population
              dynamics, genetic consequences, and ecosystem effects across a chronosequence
              of sites representing different stages of invasion, and (4) it underscores the
              value of historical evidence in reexamining current paradigms about tree
              invasions in rangelands.
