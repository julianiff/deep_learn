Abstract    :
              DEB-9806349  Liebherr    Based on analysis of morphological characters, the
              Hawaiian platynine carabid beetles (Coleoptera) comprise a monophyletic
              radiation of 131 known species, all derivable from a single generalized
              ancestor to either the oldest high island of Kauai, or an older now eroded
              island.  Phylogenetic relationships among these species provide the historical
              context within which evolutionary patterns can be evaluated.  Such patterns
              include those of biogeography, and character evolution involving flight-wing
              loss, modifications of overall body shape, specializations of the cuticle, and
              body size.  Nonetheless, morphological characters provide ambiguous
              phylogenetic information for a clade comprising 74 species of the radiation. 
              Molecular markers from mitochondrial cytochrome B, mt cytochrome oxidase II,
              ribosomal introns, and nuclear cytochrome C are used to provide substantially
              more characters to unambiguously determine phylogenetic relationships. 
              Theoretical issues concerning how to combine disparate sources of phylogenetic
              data are also investigated; i.e., 1) should gene data be treated on a site by
              site basis or as a single complex transformational character, and 2) must
              information from different characters be congruent to produce informative
              phylogenies.   In addition, taxonomic findings--newly discovered species and
              characters--are summarized in a monographic treatment of the Hawaiian
              Platynini, permitting interested researchers to identify these species for
              their biological research.
