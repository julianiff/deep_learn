Abstract    :
              9806413  Reichel    The numerical solution of image processing problems gives
              rise to very large  nonsymmetric linear systems whose solutions are extremely
              sensitive to   perturbations in the data. To avoid or at least contain the
              disastrous   effects of such instability, regularization is required.
              Regularization   yields slightly modified problems which are less sensitive to
              inaccuracies   in the data.    The aim of the research by the investigator and
              his colleague is to develop  effective and efficient regularization methods for
              the solution of large   nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in image
              processing applications,   as well as to develop new algorithms for image
              compression. The new   numerical methods will be tested on medical imaging data
              and will be   applied to interventional magnetic resonance imaging in
              collaboration with the   department for Biomedical Engineering at Case Western
              Reserve University.
