Abstract    :
                9806291   The research goals of the Primate Locomotion Laboratory at SUNY,
              Stony   Brook are the identification of adaptively significant features in  
              humans and nonhuman primates, and the reconstruction of ancient   lifestyles,
              as integral components in the study of the origin and   evolution of primates
              and humans. Using techniques that measure   electrical activity of muscles,
              forces exerted on the ground by moving   animals, 3D displacements and speed of
              limb segments, and strain   within bones, we will analyze arm-swinging,
              vertical climbing, bipedal   locomotion, and quadrupedal locomotion in monkeys
              and apes, comparing   and contrasting the functional roles of different
              morphological   features. We will focus on projects that address questions of
              energy   exchange mechanisms, loading regimes of primate long bones, the  
              influence of body size on locomotor parameters, and alternative   strategies
              for terrestrial quadrupedalism. The results will enable us   to understand why
              living monkeys, apes, and humans have evolved   different anatomies, and to
              apply that understanding to the   interpretation of fossil primate behavior and
              the uniqueness of   humans.
