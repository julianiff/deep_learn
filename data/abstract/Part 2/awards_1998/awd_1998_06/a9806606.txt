Abstract    :
              9806606  Anderson  The concept of tradeoff between current and future
              reproduction is central to life history theory, and so to our understanding of
              the evolution of reproductive characteristics. For birds, existing empirical
              demonstrations of this tradeoff are all flawed by poor choice of experimental
              species, short-term experiments, and drastic manipulations. Hence a fundamental
              tenet of evolutionary theory remains to be tested rigorously in this group.
              This research will continue an experimental test of the hypothesis that the
              cost of reproduction is a significant selective agent in the evolution of
              reproductive rate. Specifically, the study will test the hypothesis that adding
              only one additional offspring to a brood imposes a cost of reproduction large
              enough to impose natural selection against that experimental brood size. By
              using and appropriate study species yielding large samples and adopting a
              long-term perspective, this study avoids the flaws of previous work in this
              area. This study builds on 15 years of field work. Continuation of this
              research will allow the investigators to measure the direct cost of
              reproduction to parents, and the indirect cost of reproduction through
              offspring performance. These measurements will occur through climatic extremes,
              including El Ni o and La Ni a years, which will permit the analysis of climatic
              extremes as variables in this long-term study.
