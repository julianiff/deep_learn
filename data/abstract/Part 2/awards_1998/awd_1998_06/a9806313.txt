Abstract    :
              9806313  Pastor  The difficulties in developing a general theory of
              herbivore-ecosystem interactions arise from the long time-scales of population
              cycles, the complex spatial scaling of interactions between animal and plant
              populations, and thenon-linear effect of herbivores on carbon and nutrient
              flows between vegetation and soil. Such theoretical difficulties are compounded
              by the paucity of long-term, landscape-scale studies. This LTREB research will
              continue to address these problems by examining the spatial distribution of
              browse consumption by moose (Alces alces) in relation to browse supply, tree
              diameter distributions, conifer basal area, and soil nitrogen availability in
              the boreal forests of two valleys on Isle Royale. A series of alternative
              hypotheses will be tested: One series of hypotheses states that spatial
              patterns do not determine ecosystem recovery from the prior period of high
              moose population densities, while the alternative series of hypotheses invoke a
              central role of the dynamics of spatial patterns in ecosystem recovery. Changes
              in mean values of each ecosystem property will be tested by examining trends at
              grid points through time. This long-term research program covers a period of
              time in which the system has experienced the both the largest and smallest
              moose population densities. These extremes in population dynamics will provide
              valuable information on the effects of herbivores on large-scale plant
              community dynamics and ecosystem processes.
