Abstract    :
              Analyzing aggregate data is useful in many different contexts.  However,
              estimation is non-trivial and no reliable methods exist.  Standard techniques
              such as regression or correlation perform poorly (Robinson, 1950; Goodman,
              1953).  Recently, King (1997) has proposed a varying parameter model.  While
              this model is more efficient than a standard OLS model, it is not able to
              account for the central problem of correlation between the parameters and the
              regressors (aggregation bias).  The aggregation bias problem must be addressed
              in any aggregate data model.  This project addresses the problem through the
              framework of switching regression models where the state-defining variable may
              be deterministic or stochastic and measures homogeneity across the macro-level
              units.  While this specification is viable, it is unclear how to implement such
              a model.  Preliminary work has shown that time-series methods of testing
              parameter constancy are useful in this regard.  This research explores and
              analyzes different methods of testing for parameter constancy in aggregate data
              through developing formal methods of assessing structural shifts in aggregate
              data.  In addition to pursuing the covariate approach, the research also
              explores the fitting of mixture distributions.  Fitting a mixture model
              involves many crucial aspects, including choosing the type of distribution, the
              degree of mixture, diagnostics for fit, and number of states.
