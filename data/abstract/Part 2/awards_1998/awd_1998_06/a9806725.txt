              Sciver      Helium II, or superfluid helium, is a unique fluid existing below
              2.2K.  Among other properties, He II has an extremely high heat conductivity
              and obeys a non-linear heat equation.  This property has encouraged the use of
              He II in a number of technical devices including superconducting magnets and
              spaced based instruments.    To date, most work on He II focussed on studies of
              heat and mass transport in the single phase fluid with emphasis on steady state
              and transient heat transfer in static and forced flow.  In the proposed work,
              this will be expanded to include coexisting He II/saturated vapor while in a
              horizontal flow.  A horizontal experimental test facility will be developed to
              measure the effects of vapor quality, void fraction, mass flow, and heat
              transfer rates.  Experimental results will be compared to models developed
              based on the fundamental properties of the He II and the vapor.  The modeling
              effort will provide information on the limits to conventional two phase flow
              models and the basic understanding of the transport properties of He II.
