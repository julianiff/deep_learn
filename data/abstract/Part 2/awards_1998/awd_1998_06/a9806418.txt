Abstract    :
              9806418  Faust    In addition to the control of molecular weights and their 
              distributions, the ultimate goal of macromolecular engineering is  to obtain a
              high degree of control over compositional as well as  structural variables
              which affect the physical properties of  macromolecules.  Among these
              activities there has been growing  interest on the design and construction of
              linear and non-linear  block architectures, such as graft, comb, ring, star, or
              H-shaped  polymers, that self-assemble into ordered nano-structures.  Recent
              advances in living cationic polymerization coupled with  methodologies
              developed using non-(homo)polymerizable monomers  offer an unprecedented level
              of control over the molecular  architecture of these materials.  This project
              continues research  funded by NSF DMR on the synthesis, characterization and
              physical  properties of novel linear and non-linear block architectures  using
              non-(homo)polymerizable monomers in living cationic  polymerization.  These
              activities will be augmented with  continued kinetic and mechanistic studies
              with special emphasis  on addressing the use of low molecular weight model
              systems in  comparison to high molecular weight analogs.  %%%  The above novel
              materials will serve as model polymers to advance  fundamental understanding in
              structure/property relationship of  macromolecules through interdisciplinary
              research activities, to  enable the development of materials with superior
              properties.  ***
