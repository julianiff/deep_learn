Abstract    :
              This Proposal has developed out of a previous balloon flight supported by NSF
              during which MeV X-rays were observed within the auroral zone in the afternoon
              sector.  These observations were unexpected, though there have been few
              measurements taken in this local time and latitude sector which would reveal
              these phenomena.  The present proposal results from decision by the NASA
              National Scientific Balloon Facility to again launch an arctic long duration
              balloon in the summer of 1998.  It will be possible to refly the X-ray
              instruments on this flight.  This will enable several weeks of continuous
              observations, motivated largely to search for additional MeV X-ray bursts in
              order to understand the significance and nature of these phenomena.  The
              balloon observations will be made in conjunction with spacecraft observations,
              particularly the POLAR satellite which includes polar imaging instruments as
              well as plasma, wave, and field instruments.  This proposal is primarily aimed
              as hardware refurbishment to enable the flight.  A subsequent proposal will be
              submitted for analysis of the data.  This proposal is being considered by both
              NASA and NSF and both agencies are undertaking the normal review process. 
              Because, however, of the time critical needs for preparing flight instruments
              and integration into the balloon package, we have contacted reviewers to
              request an expedited  review.
