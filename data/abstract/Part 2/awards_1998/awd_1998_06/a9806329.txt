              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:    Surface Diffusion on Semiconductors -- Thermal   
                 and Beam Enhanced  Proposal Number:   CTS-9806329  Principal Investigators:
              Edmund G. Seebauer  Institution:    University of Illinois - Urbana - Champaign
                 Prof. E. G. Seebauer proposes to study by Second Harmonic Microscopy and by
              molecular dynamics simulation the surface diffusion of adsorbed species on
              elemental and compound semiconductors like Si, Ge, GaAs and GaN.  Additionally,
              he will study quantitatively the effects of photonic, ionic and electronic
              irradiation on the magnitude and direction of surface diffusion. The photon
              effects on the bulk diffusion will also be studied using ion depth profiling of
              shallow junctions. These studies are relevant to semiconductor industries, such
              as the electronic, optoelectronic, and microwave device manufacturers. In
              general, they augment knowledge valuable to several processing technologies,
              such as thin film deposition and epitaxial growth, plasma processing,
              lamp-heating, ion-assisted deposition;  and to chemical technologies, such as
              particle sintering, film etching, and corrosion.
