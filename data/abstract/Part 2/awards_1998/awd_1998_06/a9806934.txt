Abstract    :
              Abstract  Geer  ATM9806934    The American Meteorological Society, in
              cooperation with the United  States National Weather Service, will conduct a
              two-week summer  workshop for 24 master precollege teachers at the National
              Weather  Service Training in Kansas City in July 1998.  This teacher 
              enhancement program will prepare teachers to conduct peer-training  sessions
              for other teachers during the following school year on  selected meteorological
              topics concerning the sensing, analyzing,  and forecasting of weather.  The
              participants will be provided with  instructional resources materials for
              distribution and use in the  training programs they conduct.    Each
              participant will be expected to arrange and conduct two  training sessions
              during the 1998-99 school year.  On average, each  participant will train 30
              other teachers.
