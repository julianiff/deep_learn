Abstract    :
              Abstract  9806127  Stewart      The control of cell growth involves a number of
              processes to  which protein synthesis is central.  The broad term  objectives
              of this research are to understand the mechanisms  of cell signaling that lead
              to the regulation of protein  synthesis and cell growth.  Drosophila
              melanogaster will be  used as a model system in these studies since many
              cellular  components involved in protein synthesis are highly  conserved
              between flies and mammals.  In mammalian cells,  the p70 ribosomal protein S6
              kinase, p70 S6K, lies on a  cellular signaling pathway that ultimately leads to
               alterations in protein synthesis.  The Drosophila p70  ribosmal protein
              S6kinase homologue and mutations affecting  this gene have recently been
              identified. Site directed  mutations of this gene will be made and transgenic
              flies  bearing mutant versions of this gene will be generated.  This POWRE
              award will permit the PI to learn and establish  the technique of
              microinjection into embryos required for  transformation, and to perform pilot
              experiments.    ***      This is a POWRE award which will enable the
              investigator to  learn and establish the necessary techniques to make 
              transgenic flies expressing mutants of a protein critical in  protozoon
              synthesis and other cellular processes. This will  enable further experiments
              to determine it role.
