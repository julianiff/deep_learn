Abstract    :
              9806050  Pardavi-Horvath  This project addresses materials technology aspects of
               metal-metalloid soft magnetic materials, and transition  metal-rare-earth hard
              magnetic materials in nanocrystalline and  nanostructured forms. The PI will
              spend time at the Applied  Magnetism Institute of the Complutense University of
              Madrid. She  plans to investigate the applicability of the discrete FFT and 
              Preisach models to characterize the statistical distribution of  particles in
              the composite, and establish a close future  international collaboration to
              develop new magnetic  nanocomposites with controlled dielectric and magnetic 
              properties. During the spring of 1999 she will visit the Thin  Film Laboratory
              of the University of California at San Diego  where she will participate in the
              study of electronic properties  of an array of magnetic dots patterned by
              e-beam lithography on  superconducting films. She will be actively involved in
              research  on the interactions of a 2D array of small magnetic particles  with a
              superconducting substrate, performing numerical  calculations of the shape and
              size effects on the interactions,  and the sources of the domain-wall-vortex
              pinning in the  structure; additionally, she will take an active part in the 
              ongoing research on magnetic multilayers and thin films at UCSD.  %%%  This is
              a Visiting Professorship grant made under the  Professional Opportunities for
              Women in Research and Education  (POWRE) program. The research will contribute
              new materials  science knowledge at a fundamental level.
