Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9806973  Matthew Tirrell/U. Minn.    This proposal is a Workshop 
              on, "Materials Design and Processing at the nano- and Mesocales Through
              Self-Assembly' held at the national Science Foundation, January 13 and 14,
              1998.  The overall aim of the workshop is to discuss opportunities, means and
              barriers to bringing self-assembly processing of materials from their current
              state of laboratory innovation into the real technology and manufacturing
              realm.  A group of more than 35 expert scientists and engineers, including 6
              from industry and 4 from national laboratories, have agreed to participate in
              this Workshop.  Th format will be a series of four plenary lectures followed by
              intense discussion in four topical groups.    * Designing Nanostructured
              materials Through Molecular and Subunit Architecture    * Characterization
              Methods and Process Control for Self-Assembly of Nanostructured Materials     *
              Product Possibilities from Self-Assembly    * Processing Routes to
              Self-Assembly, Nanostructured Materials    The report of this workshop will be
              a working document for the National Science Foundation staff to provide
              guidance for future funding intiatives in this area.
