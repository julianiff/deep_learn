Abstract    :
              IBN 98-06233  JONAS      Brain cells respond to external cues that come from the
              external  environment or from other brain cells by changing the patterns of 
              electrical activity that they generate. These changes in  electrical activity,
              in turn, alter the release of chemicals  termed neurotransmitters, which signal
              to other nerve cells or to  muscle cells. During development of the nervous
              system and during  learning, the properties of brain cells change, causing the
              cells  to respond to external signals more or less strongly, or with a 
              different pattern of electrical activity. Dr. Jonas is studying  the molecular
              basis of how these changes in electrical activity  occur. In particular she is
              investigating the movement within  nerve cells of a class of proteins termed
              ion channels, which  constitute the building blocks for the generation of
              patterns of  electrical activity. The movement of ion channels between their 
              normal location in the surface membrane of the cell and sites  inside the cell
              may be under the control of enzymes inside the  cell known as kinases. One
              class of kinases, known as tyrosine  kinases is particularly important for such
              cellular  rearrangements. These rearrangements coupled to the movement of  ion
              channels appear to be necessary both for the formation of  connections between
              nerve cells and for normally occurring changes  in their patterns of electrical
              activity. This POWRE award will  promote the further development of Dr. Jonas'
              research career in  this important area.
