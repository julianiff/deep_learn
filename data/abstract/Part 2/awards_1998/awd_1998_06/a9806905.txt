Abstract    :
              9806905  KARL    The largest and most diverse order of vertebrates is the
              "ruling perches", or perciform fishes. Fishes of the perciform suborder
              Labroidei comprise about 15% of all living fish and include the eastern Pacific
              surfperches, reef dwelling damselfishes, parrotfishes, wrasses, and the
              well-known cichlids.  Previously, this wide array of species has been placed
              together in the Labroidei because these fish have modified structures in the
              throat region (a "modified pharyngeal apparatus") used to crush or otherwise
              prepare food items (prey) for digestion.  The sheer diversity of this
              assemblage has hindered the construction of a classification that accurately
              reflects the history (phylogeny) of these fish, so it is unclear whether the
              pharyngeal apparatus characters signal the presence of one or many lineages.   
              In this research, Stephen Karl will use DNA sequence data from three separate
              genes to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of labroid fishes,
              beginning the process of putting the classification of these fishes on a sound
              basis, and determining whether morphological features such as those associated
              with the pharyngeal apparatus appeared in one exceptionally diverse lineage of
              fishes or, rather, has appeared separately in several different, and hence only
              superficially similar, groups.  The work should provide a firm foundation for
              ongoing and future comparative studies of the physiology and behavior of these
              numerous, and frequently economically important, fishes.
