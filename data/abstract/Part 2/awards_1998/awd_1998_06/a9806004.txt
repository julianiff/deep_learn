Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT        Proposal Number:  CTS-9806004    Principal Investigator: 
              M. Rezac    A POWRE Award. The study will examine the potential for forming
              microporous polymer structures from both miscible and immiscible polymer
              blends.  A model system of polyethersulfone/a second
              polymer/N-methyl-pyrrolidone/and water will be examined by manipulating the
              molecular weight of the second polymer. At low molecular weights the systems
              are miscible and the behavior of antiplasticizers can be modeled. As the
              molecular weight increase the miscibility gap will decrease and then disappear.
              The thermodynamic equilibrium diagram will be evaluated using the cloud point
              technique. The morphology and polymer-polymer phase behavior of the resultant
              polymer structure will be evaluated and correlated with processing conditions. 
              This POWRE award is to assist the PI to develop expertise in a new area which
              is critical to her professional development.
