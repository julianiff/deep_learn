This research program is directed toward principles of
              first-order solid-state phase transformations using the prototypical case of
              martensitic reactions.  Theory and experiment address multiscale
              microstructural evolution, exploiting nonlinear nonlocal models to bridge
              length scales.  Landau-Ginsburg models are incorporated within an Element-Free
              Galerkin (EFG) method to compute 3D structures of martensitic embryos forming
              at dislocation defects in steels, investigating nucleation precursors and
              coherency transitions.  For realistic treatment of technologically important
              systems including steels and shape memory alloys, FP-LMTO total energy
              electronic calculations address the nonlinear energetics of martensitic lattice
              deformations for incorporation in the continuum calculations.  Nonlocal
              plasticity models are applied to the problem of martensitic growth in plastic
              media, as the basis of modeling morphological transitions.  Quantitative
              stereological measurements in thermoelastic and non-thermoelastic systems
              define nucleation site potency distributions and the evolution of particle
              volume.  These are combined in a comprehensive kinetic model incorporating
              morphological transitions.  The relevance of martensite theory to molecular
              level protein displacive transformations is explored in biological systems of
              current interest.

This research group is the leading activity in the
              United States in designing metal alloys for application in industry.  The
              approach is fundamental and relies on both experimental measurements and
              theory.
