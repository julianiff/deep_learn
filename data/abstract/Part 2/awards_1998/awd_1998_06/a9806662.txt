Abstract    :
                   A two-phase research project will be undertaken for which the objective is
              to use optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and in-situ tool data describing gas
              flow rates, rf power,  temperature, pressure and dc bias voltage for real-time
              diagnosis and prognosis of malfunctions in plasma etch equipment.  The
              diagnostic system will use evidential reasoning principals and neural networks
              to identify malfunctions from the process "signatures" inherent in the OES and
              tool data.  The project will also involve developing a prognostic system
              capable of predicting potential equipment malfunctions in the processing of
              integrated circuit (IC) wafers.  The prognostic system will use neural networks
              to construct time series models of the tool data and generate a malfunction
              alarm when the model predictions indicate the evolution of suspicious trends in
              the data.  The detection, classification, and prediction capabilities could
              result in dramatic improvements in overall equipment effectiveness, reduction
              in downtime, and reduction of scrap in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  
                                                                                             
                                                                        The successful
              development and implementation of the developed system can lead to significant
              productivity enhancement, which will be of great value to the semiconductor
              industry.
