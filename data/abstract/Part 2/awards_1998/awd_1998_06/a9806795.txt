Abstract    :
              Two significant components of VLSI manufacturing test cost are the  test length,
              and the reject rate. The latter is the rate at which  bad devices escape
              detection by the test. This research explores a  new approach to estimate the
              reject rate so that optimum balance  can be struck between the test length and
              the reject rate. The  approach includes extensions to handle multiple types of
              tests  that are commonly employed by the manufacturers, e.g. stuck-at,  IDDQ,
              delay, and functional. Analytical methods for estimating the  reject rate are
              too complex to capture accurately all interactions  among parameters, which
              leads to unreliable reject rate estimates.  In this project an empirical, yet
              robust model is being developed.  It is based on properties observed in tester
              data that are  demonstrated to be invariant for a wide range of manufacturing 
              technologies and types of tests.
