              Institution:  University of Florida, Gainesville    This award supports a
              Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos in  Astrophysics, to be held at the
              University of Florida in  Gainesville, 11-13 February 1998. The workshop will
              bring together  about 20 theorists in applied mathematics, galactic dynamics,
              dark  matter, plasma physics, and statistical mechanics to discuss  topics such
              as protoplanetary disks, stellar formation, spiral  structure in galaxies,
              dynamics of galaxy groups, and more general  topics, such as N-body simulations
              and multidimensional  Hamiltonian systems. It is expected that discussions
              among this  cross-disciplinary group will provide new insight by bringing 
              together conceptual developmens and tools of analysis from each  area. Graduate
              students, from U. FL and other institutions, will  have a special poster
              session of their own.
