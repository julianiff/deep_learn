POWRE/CISE:  Technical
              Challenges of 3D Visualization of Large Color Data Sets
  
This project is
              the start of the PI's research career at Columbia  University. The focus of the
              research is on the problem of 3D visualization of large color data sets.  The
              technical issues encompass registration (or alignment) of the data, color
              segmentation of the structures to be modeled, reconstruction of surfaces to
              capture both the 3D detail and color of the data set, representation of the
              highly detailed models of multi-resolution mesh representations with
              perceptually preserved textures, efficient volume rendering of large
              voxel-based representations, preservation of ``true'' color on arbitrary
              platforms and linking 3D complex scenes to semantic description of the domain. 
              This research will be conducted in the interdisciplinary environment of the
              Vesalius group which includes computational linguists, experts in library
              science and multimedia and anatomists.  The group has also an unlimited access
              to other medical faculty at the Columbia University College of Physicians and
              Surgeons.
