Abstract    :
              9806722  Doak  Ecologists have increasingly recognized the role of disease in
              controlling natural populations and communities. Disease is of particular
              importance for the numerous species with small and/or restricted ranges than
              now host non-native, invasive pathogens - diseases for which introduction into
              new regions, as well as spread within a particular region, has resulted from
              increases in local and global transportation. The outcome of such host-pathogen
              interactions will often be highly dependent upon spatial heterogeneity of host,
              pathogen and landscape features. This research concerns a host-pathogen system
              that allows for quantification of disease spread and landscape pattern at three
              different spatial scales, and comparison of host-pathogen dynamics across
              landscapes with widely varying spatial pattern. In this study, the host species
              is the Port Orford cedar, a plant that is endemic to the region around the
              California-Oregon border. The pathogen is Phytophthora lateralis, a fatal,
              non-native root pathogen. This system is ideal for studying the importance of
              both spatial heterogeneity and scale in host-pathogen interactions. In this
              study, data will be collected using observation and manipulative methods to
              determine patterns of pathogen spread and changes in cedar demography at three
              different spatial scales. Field data will aid the development of spatially
              explicit models of host-parasite dynamics and interactions. The work has direct
              implications for the study and management of the many plant species currently
              threatened by invasive diseases, as well as general effects of habitat pattern
              and fragmentation for species interactions.
