Abstract    :
              This study is motivated by interest in the outcome of competition among national
              and global financial exchanges and by an enduring desire to understand the
              evolution of American capital markets and their relationship to long term
              economic growth.  As an endeavor that combines economics, finance, and history,
              it uses the financial history of the United States in the nineteenth century as
              a laboratory to study competition among stock exchanges.  The project gathers
              evidence on the relative importance of the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia
              stock exchanges; assembles information on internal and external changes that
              affected the evolution of these markets; and tests plausible hypotheses about
              factors that influenced their relative success.  The goal is to explain why New
              York emerged as the nation's dominant exchange in competition in other regional
              markets.  The findings will interest economic historians who seek to understand
              the connection between financial exchanges and economic performance; economists
              who study competition across markets, and policy makers who seek to improve
              America's competitive position in international financial markets.
