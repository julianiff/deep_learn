Abstract    :
              9871253  Mastrangelo  In this proposal the PIs request funds to purchase a new
              replacement for their mask maker machine at the University of Michigan
              Solid-State Laboratory. Their ASET machine was donated by Ford Motor Company in
              January of 1993.  Since it was installed in their lab, this machine has served
              more than one hundred of users, both internal and external to the Solid-State
              Laboratory, and it has become an essential piece of equipment.  Currently, this
              machine serves 37 regular qualified student operators serving more than 110
              students, with an annual usage of 250 mask plates per year.  Since 1993,
              approximately 1000 lithographic mask plates have been made in this machine in
              support of as many as 200 different student projects from more than 1O
              different faculty members.  Photolithographic masks are essential for solid
              state device work.  Typically, as many as 20 masks per student per year are
              required.  Externally, each of these costs between $400-$600.  With our
              existent system each mask is made at a cost of $50.  Approximately 250 masks
              are made per year by the UM faculty resulting in roughly $90,000 of savings per
              year.  The high cost of mask making is a definite limiting factor in the
              research performed at the Solid-State lab, and their system has served them
              well in reducing these costs.  While still useful, the current mask making
              machine is a 1986 model, and it is difficult to repair.  Its controlling
              computer and associated boards have chips no longer manufactured.  The lack of
              parts is a serious concern.  Further, its mechanical parts already show signs
              of wear.  Therefore, they believe that this machine will soon no longer be
              supportable.  This will have a major impact in all the research projects that
              utilize the machine, and unless this situation is remedied, the overall
              laboratory output will drop substantially.  Therefore, they must request funds
              to replace their system.  The replacement of our system has a cost of $695,300
              (options 1,2, and 4 included).While expensive,  a new machine has slightly
              better optical resolution that the older system, but it has completely new
              mechanical parts therefore a much greater reliability.  The die size will
              remain at its current large size (2 cm) at the expense of resolution (1.1 um)
              because most of our sensor and MEMS projects need the large die capability
              (mask makers with finer resolution cannot project over these large dies).  ***
