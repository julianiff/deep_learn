Abstract    :
                Proposal Number:  9806483    PI:  Kodric-Brown, Astrid      Title:  
              "Introgression in Pupfish: Role of Sexual and  Natural Selection".          The
              Pecos pupfish, native to the Pecos river, is curently in  jeopardy of
              extinction due to hybridization with a closely  related introduced species, the
              Sheepshead minnow.  Within  five years of the introduction, hybrids replaced
              the native  species in over half of its istoric range.  Several factors  may
              contribute to the success of hybirds; they may survive  better, grow faster,
              and be more attractive as mates than  either of the parental species. 
              Experimental studies of  female mate choice and competitive interactions among
              males  of the two parental species and their hybrids will determine  whether
              hybrids have a mating advantage.    Life-history traits, such as growth rate,
              size at maturity,  and the number of eggs roduced, will be measured to 
              determine whether they influence the rate of hybridization.  Many native
              southwestern fishes are threatened by extinction  through hybridization with
              introduced exotic species.  This  research will provide information about the
              behavioral and  ecological processes that promote hybridization with 
              introduced non-native species and more generally, the role  of these processes
              in sexual selection and species  formation. This research has applications for
              conservation  and restoration of populations of native species.
