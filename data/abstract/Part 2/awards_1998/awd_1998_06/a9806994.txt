Rosen
This is a 24-month award proposed by Dr. Barry Rosen, Wayne
              State University and
Dr. Kan-Jen Tsai, Chung Shan Medical and Dental College
              in Taiwan to study the structure and mechanism of Zn 2+ and CD2+ transporters
              in bacteria.  Dr. Rosen's laboratory plans to carry out  research on
              characterization of ATPases activity; Dr. Tsai will conduct a study on the
              site-directed mutagenesis of Cys  residues and of a motif (CPC) in a
              membrane-spanning region of the putative transporters.  This is a very good
              international research project in an area in which Dr. Rosen's laboratory has
              an extensive experience in this area of research.  His Taiwan counterpart will
              work in a complimentary field with him on this study.   This project also
              addresses an INT focus area of providing an opportunity for a U.S. graduate
              student to work in the counterpart scientist's laboratory in Taiwan.  This
              study is jointly supported by the NSF and the National Science Council of
              Taiwan.
