Abstract    :
              This project will renew support of a collection of protists, including living
              and parasitic organisms. The objective of the collection is to conserve and
              distribute to the scientific community a comprehensive range of authenticated
              organisms and associated strain data for use in research and education.  The
              collection presently maintains 1637 strains of protozoa representing 215 genera
              and 500 species. In addition, the collection maintains 176 strains of algae
              representing 59 genera and 100 species. Approximately 800 cultures are
              distributed annually.

The collection strives to develop new and unique ways
              to acquire, authenticate, characterize, document, classify, propagate,
              preserve, use and distribute protists that meet current and future scientific
              needs. It seeks to enhance the quality and authenticity of the cultures with
              additional strain data.

This project will provide about thirty percent of
              the total expenditures required for on-going maintenance of the collection and
              for enhancing the quality of its acquisitions and the efficiency of its
              services.
