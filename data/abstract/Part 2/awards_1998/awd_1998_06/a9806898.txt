Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop algoithms and tools for modeling
              hardware and software using a high-level programming language, or an HDL, and
              use it to develop algorithms for language-level "presynthesis" optimizations. 
              Research activities being carried out under this grant include: (a) indentify
              semantic support for modeling reactive and structural components in a
              high-level language that preserves synthesizability of the resulting
              description; (b) explore the nature of the Don't Care (DC) information an
              design assertions that are used to optimize an HDL description; develop
              appropriate models to capture the DC information; (c) develop a tabular model
              of system behavior called. Timed Decision Tables (TDTs); (d) use TDT model
              transformations to restructure and rewrite HDL code for improved synthesis
              results.  The research results are being used to develop a framework for
              language-level exploration and optimization of design alternatives for
              microelectronic systems.
