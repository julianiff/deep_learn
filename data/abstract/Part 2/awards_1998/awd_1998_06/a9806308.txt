Abstract    :
              9806308  Adenwalla  This research project will investigate the size, shape and 
              spacing dependence of regular arrays of micron sized magnetic  features,
              multilayer features, and measure the coupling between  them. The magnetization
              of these arrays will be studied using  conventional magnetic measurements which
              will give information  about the overall bulk magnetization properties, and
              will also  include in-situ Magneto-optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements 
              which provide information during sample growth as well as  information about
              the magnetic correlations between features.  With a high resolution MOKE set up
              it will be possible to study  the magnetization feature by feature. Greater
              understanding of  magnetic properties of these arrays and by extension the
              effects  of size, shape and spacing on magnetic properties in general is 
              anticipated.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the
              Professional  Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) 
              program. The research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a
              fundamental level.
