     The objective of this research is to advance the
              understanding of the processing of polymeric composites through the combination
              of ultraviolet (UV) and thermal cure processes. The research will address the
              exploratory work necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique,
              and future projects will expand the scope of this research. Two commonly used
              composite manufacturing methods, namely filament winding and pultrusion, will
              be examined. The project will demonstrate the use of the UV cure technique with
              common polymeric production techniques, and will provide data which can be used
              to optimize the use of UV cure techniques for the production of high-quality,
              cost-effective polymeric composites.  To facilitate technology transfer,
              commercially available materials and manufacturing equipment will be used in
              this study.  The research will be conducted in collaboration with and supported
              by Shell Development Company and Loctite Corporation.
     The project will
              enable the investigator to take advantage of a unique opportunity to establish
              industry linkages while establishing a research area which is not currently
              being addressed in academia.  It is expected that both educational and research
              opportunities will be enhanced by this activity.
