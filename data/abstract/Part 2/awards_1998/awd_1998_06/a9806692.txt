Abstract    :
              Price  9806692    The number of species on earth depends on a balance between
              the production of new species and their loss through extinction.  While great
              attention is being paid to extinction, many questions about the way in which
              species form remain unresolved.  Ernst Mayr drew attention to the value of
              studying so-called ring species.  Ring species consist of a chain of
              populations encircling a geographical barrier.  At one point in the ring two
              populations meet but do not interbreed.  Because the reproductively isolated
              populations are very closely related, they offer a model system in which to
              examine the process of speciation.  Ring species are rare, requiring a special
              arrangement of geography and history.              Dr. Price has identified a
              probable ring species and will conduct research to investigate its formation.
              The species being studied is a small passerine bird for which song appears to
              be the main trait used in species recognition.  Song variation and recognition
              of songs are being studied around the ring in order to understand how
              reproductive isolation has arisen at its ends. Studies of DNA variation across
              the populations are being used to ask to what extent they are still connected
              by levels of gene flow, and to trace historical patterns of range expansion and
              fragmentation. This approach should enable Dr. Price to trace a complete
              continuum from within-population variation up to reproductively isolated
              sympatric species.  A thorough understanding of that continuum is crucial to
              understanding speciation, and ultimately what controls species number.
