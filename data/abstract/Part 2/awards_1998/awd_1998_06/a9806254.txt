Abstract    :
              This award provides fellowship support to a student for post-doctoral  research
              and training.  The student's proposed research project is entitled `The
              Influence of Intentionality, Racial and Gender Information of African-and
              European-American Children's Social Judgments.` The study investigates African-
              and European-American children's use of outcome intentionality information in
              dispositional and likeability judgements of black and white story characters. 
              Prior empirical investigation suggests that there may be ethnic variations in
              social perception, such that the culture/ethnicity of perceivers influence
              their dispositional judgements.  Age-related differences may exist in such
              influence as well.  To further explore children's social judgements, this
              project will investigate age and ethnic variation in the influence of outcome
              intentionality information on children's dispositional and preference
              judgements.  Prior research has not investigated children's judgements of
              female actors.  Children will be presented with judgement stories about actors
              who intentionally almost cause a harmful outcome and actors who unintentionally
              almost cause a harmful outcome.  Second and fifth grade children will be asked
              to rate actors on likeability, disposition, and cross-situational behavior.  It
              is expected that the children's ethnicity, age, the actor's ethnicity and
              gender, and outcome intentionality information, will influence the children's
              judgements.
