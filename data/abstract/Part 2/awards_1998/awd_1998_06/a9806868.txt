Abstract    :
              The proposed program will test theoretical predictions of the acceleration of
              electrons by Alfven waves by conducting a series of laboratory experiments
              using the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA.  It is well known that
              accelerated electrons are found in the earth's auroras, but the mechanism by
              which the particles are accelerated has remained unclear.  On leading candidate
              for the acceleration mechanism is inertial Alfven waves.  This study will use a
              well controlled set of laboratory experiments to determine whether or not the
              Alfven wave acceleration mechanism is viable.
