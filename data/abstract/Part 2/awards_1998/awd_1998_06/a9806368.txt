Abstract    :
              9806368  Dick    The Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) comprise a phylum of colonial animals
              broadly  distributed worldwide in marine and freshwater benthic habitats.
              Colonies,  which are readily visible, are composed of hundreds or thousands of
              tiny  zooids, each less than a millimeter long. There are an estimated 6,000 
              living species and over 15,000 described fossil species. The largest group 
              containing living bryozoan species is the class Gymnolaemata, currently 
              divided into two orders: Ctenostomata and Cheilostomata. Ctenostomes have 
              zooids with uncalcified walls, whereas cheilostomes have calcified walls.  The
              large majority of living bryozoan species are cheilostomes, which have 
              undergone a great radiation since their appearance approximately 145  million
              years ago. Because of their extensive fossil record, considerable  diversity,
              and broad distribution, cheilostomes have been very important  in evolutionary
              and ecological studies. However, correct interpretation of  these studies
              depends upon a reliable knowledge of evolutionary  relationships among
              cheilostomes. Reconstructing this phylogeny using  morphological characters has
              been exceedingly difficult, due to high  levels of convergence among
              characters. To begin to remedy this problem,  this study will gather DNA
              sequence data from bryozoans and perform  cladistic analyses to reconstruct
              phylogeny. Preliminary work utilizing a  partial sequence of the mitochondrial,
              large-subunit 16S rRNA gene has  suggested that cheilostome phylogeny is likely
              to be complex, and  inseparable from a broader consideration of gymnolaemate
              phylogeny. The  goals of this study are 1) to utilize sequences from the
              nuclear 18S rRNA  gene to determine whether the Gymnolaemata are a monophyletic
              group in the  context of a higher-level bryozoan phylogeny, and to reconstruct 
              higher-level relationships among ctenostome and cheilostome bryozoans, and  2)
              to utilize sequence data from both the 18S rRNA gene and the  mitochondrial 16S
              rRNA gene to reconstruct superfamily- level relationships  among cheilostomes.
