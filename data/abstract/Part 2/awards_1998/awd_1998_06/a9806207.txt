POWRE/CISE:  Support for Research in an New Area:  Automated Text
              Categorization

The objective of this research is to enable the PI to move
              from purely theoretical computer science into a new, applied research area, in
              her new academic position.  The focus is on text categorization and doing
              experimental work aimed towards determining the form of the underlying
              text-categorization function, developing new text-categorization heuristics,
              and performing hierarchical classification.  The research is motivated by the
              need for automatic methods of text categorization  which will place documents
              into categories according to their contents in applications such as the
              World-Wide-Web and other electronic publications.
