Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded by the Division of Chemistry supports the research and
              educational activities of Dr. Alenka Luzar at the University of California at
              San Francisco.  The research aims to understand hydrophobic phenomena and their
              relationship with hydrophilicity and with water hydrogen-bond dynamics in
              confined geometries.  The ultimate goal is to elucidate static and dynamic
              aspects of solvent-induced forces between synthetic and biological solutes in
              an aqueous environment with special emphasis on the dynamical aspects.  These
              issues will be attacked on several fronts using the methods of statistical
              mechanics.  Molecular dynamics simulations, large-scale Monte Carlo techniques,
              and field theoretic models will be employed.

The opportunity afforded
              through the POWRE program will enhance Dr. Luzar's research potential as well
              as her ultimate goal of the educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate,
              and postdoctoral scientists in both classroom and research laboratory.   The
              proposed research program is relevant to many complex and poorly understood
              everyday phenomena in biochemistry and materials science.  Examples include the
              action of detergents, biological organization and interactions in biological
              membranes.
