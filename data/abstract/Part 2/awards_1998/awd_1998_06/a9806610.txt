Nutrient effects on a detritus-based stream
              ecosystem

Increased nutrient concentrations threaten aquatic ecosystems
              worldwide. Nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, from human and animal
              sewage and fertilizer runoff from farmland, are found in high concentrations in
              many lakes and streams.  The amount of algae in the water body typically
              increases greatly in response to increased nutrient supply and dramatically
              alters the rest of the food web.  However, the energy source of many aquatic
              food webs is dead plants (detritus) with associated bacteria and fungi, not
              algae.  This study will determine the effects of increased nutrient supply on a
              detrital-based food web in a forested stream.  The investigators will test
              whether nutrient addition increases microbial production and subsequently
              increases growth of stream consumers.  They will also test whether microbes
              deplete detritus at rates that result in less food for higher consumers,
              thereby destabilizing the food web.  The results of this work will aid in
              predicting how other detrital-based ecosystems respond to and are altered by
              human modification of nutrient supply.
