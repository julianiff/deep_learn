Abstract    :
              9806467  Scott    This grant supplies partial support for student participants 
              to attend the Third Pacific Rim International Conference on  Advanced Materials
              and Processing in Honolulu.  The  conference is organized jointly by the
              Chinese Society for  Metals, Japan Institute of Metals, The Korean Institute of
               Metals and Materials, and The Minerals, Metals and Materials  Society of the
              United States.  The Pacific Rim International  Conference is held every three
              years and is rotated among  the four organizing societies.  The first
              conference was  held in Hangzhou, China, June 1992.  The second conference  was
              held in Kyonju, South Korea, June 1995.  The objective  of this third
              conference, PRICM 3, is to provide a forum for  the exchange of technical
              information on materials  processing and characterization with a focus on
              electronic,  magnetic and optical materials, structural materials, and 
              functional materials.  Over 500 presentations are planned in  addition to
              poster sessions.  %%%  The conference explores advances in science and
              technology  in materials areas of significant value to industry,  including,
              advanced ferrous alloys, intermetallic alloys,  magnetic alloys, rapid
              prototyping, spray forming, smart  materials, and diamond film growth.  ***
