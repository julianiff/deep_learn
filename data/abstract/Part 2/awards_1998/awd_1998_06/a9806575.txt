              ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9806575    INVESTIGATOR(S) : NAIMAN    INSTITUTION:
              UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON    TITLE: Keystone Interactions: Salmon, Bear and
              Riparian Vegetation in Riverine Corridors of the Pacific Northwest      
              Interactions between Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and bear (Ursus spp.)
              appear to play an important role in influencing the stature and dynamics of
              riparian vegetation in the Pacific Northwest. Preliminary data suggest that
              marine-derived nutrients accumulate in riparian vegetation, and that bears may
              act as an important vector for moving nutrients from the stream to the riparian
              zone through the killing and consumption of salmon and subsequent deposition of
              carcasses and feces within the riparian forest. Inputs of marine-derived
              nutrients may enhance growth rates of riparian trees and influence the
              production of large woody debris, which may in turn affect structural habitat
              and productivity within the stream corridor.    The objectives of this project
              are to discover the extent to which riparian vegetation acquires marine-derived
              nitrogen from spawning salmon; to assess the impacts of marine-derived
              nutrients on riparian growth and community composition; to assess the relative
              importance of bear activity (e.g., carcass and feces distribution) and
              hyporheic flow as pathways for transfer of N from stream to riparian systems;
              and to assess the community importance of salmon-bear interactions with regard
              to the growth of riparian vegetation. The principal methods used in the
              evaluation of these objectives are the measurement of stable isotopes (15N) and
              experimental manipulation of salmon carcasses and bear feces. The significance
              of this research lies in the discovery of how synergistic interactions between
              the ocean, salmon and bear can act to influence riparian forests, and how
              materials from those forests act to influence salmon population strength.
