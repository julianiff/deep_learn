                ESS: COIL: A Common Object Interconnection Language to Support Database 
              Integration and Evolution    Commercial information management technology is
              about to undergo a massive   developmental phase. The emerging global economy
              has created a dramatic   demand for distributed database technology, so that
              far-flung corporations   can manage information that is strewn across dozens or
              hundreds of   incompatible databases. The development of high-bandwidth
              networking   technology has provided the infrastructure for supporting such
              distributed   databases. What is missing is the software to make effective use
              of this   hardware. Currently available software allows data to be accessed  
              regardless of its physical location, but does not provide significant   support
              for interrelating databases that are incompatible in the way they   structure
              data and in the terminology used to describe data. Simply put,   current
              software allows databases to be located at multiple physical places   around
              the globe, but cannot effectively resolve semantic differences. The   COIL
              (Common Object Interconnection Language) project has as its goal the  
              development of a computer language for programming and rapidly evolving  
              interconnections between multiple, incompatible databases. The COIL  
              programming language will allow software applications using mainstream  
              relational database products (such as Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft Access)  
              to be interconnected. COIL will also allow applications to share data   between
              relational systems and newer, more powerful object-oriented and  
              object/relational databases.
