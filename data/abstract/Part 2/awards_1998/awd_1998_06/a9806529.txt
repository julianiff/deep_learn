	The aims of this research are to determine
              effects of enriched atmospheric CO2 concentration on mycorrhizal associations
              between vascular plants and fungi, working in a field experiment at the Cedar
              Creek LTER site in Minnesota.  The focus of the work is on effects of
              individual species of plants and fungi on community and ecosystem functioning,
              and on changes in those effects with CO2 enrichment.  Additional experiments
              will be done in pure culture and in greenhouse pot experiments.  The work is
              important because mycorrhizal associations between plants and fungi are a key
              link between primary production and soil processes.  Anthropogenic enrichment
              of atmospheric CO2 and soil N is expected to have a significant impact on these
              vital symbioses but the nature of that impact is poorly understood at
              present.
