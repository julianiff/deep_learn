Abstract    :
              9806196  Mukherjee  This grant is made under the NSF "Professional Opportunities
              for Women in Research and Education" program.  It will provide support for the
              start of an independent research effort at Barnard College.  The PI will
              collaborate in the  "Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment",
              which will use the solar research facility of Sandia National Laboratory to
              study high-energy gamma rays.  The PI will build calibration hardware, will
              participate in the initial detector testing, and observing, and will contribute
              to the data analysis.
