Abstract    :
              Political conservatism has become a major presence in American life, and this
              project by a cultural anthropologist studies how political beliefs work in the
              daily affairs of people who regard themselves as conservative.  The project
              will investigate political ideologies of a rural county in the mountains of
              North Carolina, in order to understand the beliefs that inform local affairs.
              The project will investigate two forms of conservatism, traditionalist
              (reflecting the personalistic and egalitarian patterns of small-town life) and
              progressive (reflecting the patterns of mainstream middle-class American
              society).  By studying the trend away from Democratic party affiliation towards
              conservatism over the past 30 years, through the medium of analysis of several
              local controversies about which people will have formed opinions, and relating
              the local issues to the national context, the study will advance our
              understanding of this political viewpoint in a representative social situation.
              Methods include participant observation, in-depth interviews of a range of
              respondents, and a random sample of households.  The new knowledge to be
              created by this project will be valuable for the insight it will give into the
              complex and fluid political positions taken by people along the spectrum of
              conservative belief and action.
