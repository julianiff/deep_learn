Abstract    :
              9806310  Connell  A long-term study of tree populations in tropical and
              subtropical rain forests in Australia has been carried on for 34 years. The
              objective has been to elucidate the processes and mechanisms that are
              responsible for the high species diversity and the varieties of population
              structures among the many species in these forests. Long-term data have been
              collected on rates of seedling recruitment, and on growth and mortality of all
              sizes of all species of trees in these forests. In recent years the intensity
              of flowering and fruiting of adult trees of 103 species, and the subsequent
              germination and survival rates of new seedlings, has also been measured. This
              study is among the longest done on tropical and subtropical trees, and is the
              longest for the seedling and sapling stages.    This study will test the
              hypothesis that diversity is maintained in these forests because spatially
              common species have lower rates of reproduction, growth, and survival than
              spatially rare species. Other hypotheses to be addressed are: (1) that many
              species coexist by specializing to live in different habitats, (2) that
              diversity confers advantages which increase growth and survival of seedlings,
              and (3) that local (insects) and regional (rainfall) factors interact to affect
              diversity in these forests.    Overall, this project will advance our
              understanding of the different factors that lead to high tree species diversity
              in tropical and subtropical rainforests. These are some of the most complex and
              diverse ecological communities known, and contain a high proportion of the
              worlds terrestrial species of organisms. Detailed, long-term studies such as
              this one will contribute to an understanding of factors that control diversity
              in these forests, and therefore help to manage and preserve their integrity.
