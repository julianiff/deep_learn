Ecologists are
              increasingly recognizing that the nature of species interactions may vary
              depending upon the environmental context in which they occur.  This project
              would test the notion that the behavior of herbivores in stream communities and
              their interactions with autotrophic organisms will vary as environmental
              conditions change.  It will examine this phenomenon in streams as a key
              environmental feature , current velocity, varies distinctly in a quantifiable
              manner.  Interactions between herbivores and producers will be evaluated under
              a range of current conditions.  Experiments will be conducted in streamside
              channels and in instream situations where current conditions and the density of
              herbivores can be manipulated and responses by autotrophs can be evaluated. 
              Results from this project will have general applications to diverse ecological
              systems.  It will provide insights into the evaluation of context dependency in
              an array of situations taking advantage of a situation where distinct
              environmental features can be quantified and incorporated into assessments of
              the functioning of an ecosystem.
