POWRE/CISE:   Understanding and Improving Memory System
              Performance

This POWRE grant will help the PI to re-enter academia, where
              she can be more effective researcher, teacher and mentor. The award will
              provide resources to build her research program while spending a year as a
              Research Assistant Professor at University of Utah.  The research focuses on
              better understanding memory system performance and then using this knowledge to
              design more efficient and effective memory systems. The objective is to develop
              comprehensive approach to bridging the processor/memory performance gap by
              developing better measures of performance, better goals for observing memory
              system behavior and understanding memory usage patterns, and combined compiler
              and architectural schemes to exploit these patterns.
