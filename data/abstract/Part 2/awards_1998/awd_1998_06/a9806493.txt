Abstract    :
              9806493  Harmon  Leaf and root decomposition can be thought of as a continuous
              process beginning with fresh plant litter and leading to the fomation of
              increasingly refractory organic matter. This refractory material is thought to
              be a precursor to soil organic matter, and thus influences nutrient
              availability, production, and carbon sequestration in ecosystems. A team, LIDET
              (Long-term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team), has installed a set of
              experiments to test the effects of macroclimate and substrate quality on the
              long-term carbon and nutrient dynamics of leaf and fine root litter. These
              long-term experiments involve 16 LTER and 11 other cooperating sites, and a
              total of 31 types of litter. The experiments are designed to follow changes in
              mass, organic fractions, and nutrients for up to 10 years.   Now that the study
              as passed its half-way point, continued funding will allow the completion of
              data collection, laboratory analysis of organic constituents, and nutrient
              content. In addition, data will be made available over the Internet. The plan
              is to continue the original design and to add a new study on the chemistry of
              native litters at each site. This new work will provide a litter chemistry data
              set that is compatible with the LIDET decomposition data and will also allow
              broad-scale extrapolation of the substrate quality findings of the experiment.
              The data generated by this study will prove extremely useful in future modeling
              and synthesis efforts. This funding will also provide the investigators the
              time and money to complete this long-term intersite project.
