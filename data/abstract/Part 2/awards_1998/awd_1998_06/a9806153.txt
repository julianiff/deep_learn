Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Klemperer will study the dynamics and structure of small
              van der Waals complexes.  He will use intracavity laser induced fluorescence
              (LIF) of seeded jets to achieve very high internal excitation energies and
              subsequently obtain the rotation-vibration distribution of the product
              photofragments.  Klemperer will also exploit microwave-optical double resonance
              techniques (MODR) for very high-resolution studies, which will allow
              measurement of hyperfine structure and precise electric dipole moments.  He
              will focus on complexes involving hydrides (HF, H2O, HCl) at high excitation
              levels of valence bond stretching, e.g., v=4 levels of HF stretch.  The
              ultimate goal is to obtain information on the intermolecular potential surfaces
              and to provide stringent tests for models for vibrational predissociation
              dynamics.

The structures of molecules and the attractive forces between them
              are, in part, responsible for their reactivity.  This research will provide
              detailed information on the nature of these interactions and the effect of
              molecular structure on chemical bonding.  Such information is important for
              understanding the effects of solvents on chemical reactions or the folding
              patterns of proteins and nucleic acids.
