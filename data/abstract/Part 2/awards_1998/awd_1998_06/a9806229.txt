Abstract    :
              9806229  Zandt    This grant provides partial funding to upgrade the University
              of  Arizona seismology research computer facility to accommodate  increasing
              demands in network loads, mass storage requirements,  and computational speed.
              In the past five years the computational  needs in seismology at the University
              of Arizona have expanded  greatly with our involvement in four major field
              experiments and  the addition of a new faculty member in 1997. The upgraded 
              facility will be used in the research programs of the seismology  group that
              includes four faculty members (Beck, Johnson, Wallace,  and Zandt), a computer
              systems administrator, and currently one  postdoc and 12 graduate students.
              Each faculty member has at  least one active NSF research grant, and are
              involved in research  that spans a broad range of topics including the source 
              properties of intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes, the  earthquake cycle of
              large and great circum-Pacific earthquakes,  the lithospheric structure and
              regional tectonics of the central  Andes and Tibet, the crustal structure and
              seismic stratigraphy  of terranes in the western U.S., and monitoring of the 
              comprehensive test ban treaty.  ***
