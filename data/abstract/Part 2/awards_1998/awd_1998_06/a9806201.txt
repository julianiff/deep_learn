Abstract    :
              This project builds a new model of economic exchange: networks, rather than
              markets, of buyers and sellers.  It begins with the empirically motivated
              premise that a buyer and a seller must have a relationship, a `link` to
              exchange goods.  Networks-buyers and sellers and a pattern of links that
              connect them-are a common exchange environment.  The project examines why
              agents may form networks and develops a methodology to study network
              structures.  The model developed captures the characteristics of a variety of
              industries, including engineering and electronics subcontracting and apparel. 
              This research promises to advance the economic theory of networks and exchange
              institutions.  The arguments developed in the project can be used to study any
              bipartite setting including supervisory hierarchies and international trading
              blocs.  The theory will also allow a comparison of networks to alternative
              exchange institutions such as vertical integration and anonymous markets.  The
              investigator is junior faculty in a critical stage in her career and this
              project involves a large, new area of research using new techniques.  To make
              an investment of this size early in a career involves some risk, since the full
              payoff is realized only after a number of years.  The potential of the project,
              however, in terms of new theory, results, and publications is quite large.  The
              opportunity to devote time now to the research is pivotal for the
              investigator's tenure case and future in scientific research.
