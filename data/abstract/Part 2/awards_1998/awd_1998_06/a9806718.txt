              EIA-9806718  Mairson, Harry G.  Bawden, Alan  Brandeis University    ESS: 
              Linear Naming: Experimental Software for Optimizing Communication Protocols   
              The goal of our research project is to design and implement significantly   new
              forms of procedure calling protocols for local and distributed   communication.
              This project combines development of applications technology   with
              foundational research on programming language design. The research   focuses on
              the implementation of a new procedure-calling protocol that   incorporates the
              desirable semantics of call-by-value with the efficiency   of call-by-name. The
              implementation depends on the technology of sharing   values as well as the
              sharing of computation threads. Closely linked is the   development of language
              primitives for handling values and control   structures in a symmetric manner. 
                The pragmatics of sharing is intimately connected to the crucial role of  
              "linear naming" in distributed network computation, especially when named  
              computations are mobile. Procedure-calling protocols and their interaction  
              with naming form the glue that holds complex computations together. In a  
              distributed environment, parts of an evolving computation can become  
              separated from each other. A fundamental problem is bringing these parts   back
              together again when the appropriate time arrives---this is what naming   is
              for. Proper attention to linearity in naming can make cross-network  
              references cheap, can support highly mobile data structures, and can  
              facilitate heuristics to effectively migrate tasks on demand without   explicit
              guidance.
