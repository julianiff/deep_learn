              ABSTRACT    OPP-9806926    PIs:  Johnson, Mark     Proshutinsky, Andrey     
              Polyakov, Igor    Institution:  University of Alaska    The investigators will
              seek to identify decadal scale signals in the Arctic's atmospheric and oceanic
              systems to understand the major self-regulated and external forcing mechanisms
              maintaining observed long-period variations.  Simulation studies will use
              observational data from ocean stations and hydrological/meteorological
              stations, tide gauges, current meters, satellites, and drifting buoys to
              examine the three-dimensional variations in circulation associated with two
              different postulated climate regimes of circulation. This research project is
              critical to understanding the role of climate on Arctic Ocean circulation in
              the context of climate shifts that could occur in response to global change. 
              Global change is expected to impact the Arctic first and with greater intensity
              than anywhere else and the Arctic response to climate change must be known in
              order forecast possible impacts.
