POWRE-CISE:  A New Algorithm for Minimizing Common Entropy Measures
              for Signal Enhancement, Estimation, and Source Localization

This research
              aims at establishing a research program for the PI who has re-entered academic
              career after an interruption.  The research involves a new algorithm for signal
              processing which is computationally efficient in a class of problems involving
              signal refinement, enhancement and recursive updating.  The algorithm employs a
              novel iteractive architecture and the project objectives include developing
              solid mathematical foundations and five special implementations of the
              algorithm.
