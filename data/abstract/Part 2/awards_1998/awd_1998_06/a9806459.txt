Abstract    :
              CTS-9806459  Robert Pfeffer  NJIT  ABSTRACT    Partial support will be provided
              for travel of U.S. contributors to the Particle Technology Forum (PTF) of the
              AIChE organized in conjunction with the 3rd World Congress in Particle
              Technology in Brighton, England on July 7-9, 1998.  PTF has hosted two U.S.
              National biennial conferences in Denver, 1994 and San Diego, 1996, but this
              will be the first event co-supported overseas.  The World Congress events are
              major highlights in the particle science and technology field, the two previous
              meetings were in 1986 and 1990 in Germany and Japan, respectively.    The World
              Congress meeting will focus on the development of novel particle formation
              processes, the application of new understanding of interparticle forces to
              processing behavior, the impact of new measuring methods, and the rapid
              advancement of simulation and modeling techniques.  The technical meeting will
              also be run in conjunction with an International Particle Technology
              Exhibition.  The World Congress on Particle Technology 1998 will attract over
              600 participants and over 400 papers from the world's leading particle
              technologists.  ***
