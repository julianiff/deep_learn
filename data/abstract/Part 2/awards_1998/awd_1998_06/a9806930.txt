Abstract    :
              9806930  PAWLIK    Support for this U.S.-Australia symposium will make it 
              possible for eleven young American researchers to take part  in the 5th
              International Symposium on Sponge Biology in  Brisbane, Australia in June 1998.
               The participation of  these young researchers -- including three post-docs,
              five  graduate students, and three undergraduates-will feature not  only
              attendance at the symposium, where they will meet the  world's leading
              researchers in sponge biology, but also a  workshop designed especially to
              engage them in discussion  about their own interests and research. The U.S.
              organizers  are David Pawlik of the University of North Carolina at  Wilmington
              and Adele Pile of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic  Institution, Fort Pierce,
              Florida.  The Australian and New  Zealand Organizers include Dr. John Hooper,
              Senior Curator  for Sessile Marine Vertebrates, Queensland Museaum, and 
              Professor Patricia Bergquist, Assistant Vice-Chancellor, The  University of
              Auckland.
