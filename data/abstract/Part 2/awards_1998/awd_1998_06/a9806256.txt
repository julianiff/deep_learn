Abstract    :
              This award provides fellowship support to a student for post-doctoral  research
              and training.  The student's proposed research project is entitled `Catching
              the Wave of Capitalism in the Wake of the Nuclear Age: Subsistence,
              Development, and Environmental Security in French Polynesia.`  This study
              argues that multilateral environmental governance precipitates environmental
              degradation by failing to recognize the critical role of local resource users
              and politics in processes of conservation and degradation.  In particular, this
              study focuses on subsistence fishing in Moorea and Raiatea, which is primarily
              performed by women in lagoons, and provides up to 70 percent of animal protein
              in the local diet.  The thesis is that the recent intensification of fishing,
              agriculture and tourism results in the marginalization of women's subsistence
              fishing, increasing scarcity of resources, a breakdown in sustainable marine
              resource management practices, and new forms of local and regional
              environmental conflicts. Fieldwork methods include: interviews and participant
              observation with fishers (men, women, commercial and subsistence) to understand
              the nature and dimensions of marine resource politics; the design and
              construction of a Geographic Information System (GIS) which analyzes and maps a
              variety of conflicting individual, state, and institutional perceptions of
              marine space and use; and the archival research to determine how the role of
              women in Polynesian political economy has been shaped by colonial attitudes on
              gender.  Theoretically, this study engages and expands the debates over
              environmental security, gender, and the environment, and the social
              implications of Geographic Information Science.
