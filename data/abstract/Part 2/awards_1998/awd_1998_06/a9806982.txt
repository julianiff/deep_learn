Abstract    :
              9806982  Bagheri  This research will develop remote sensing methodology for  use
              as a tool in aiding the assessment and the management of  water quality in
              nearshore waters using imaging spectrometer  AVIRIS data and in situ field
              measurements, augmented by  SeaWIFS data for synoptic purposes.  The test site
              is the  Hudson/Raritan Estuary which is a complex ecosystem,  important to the
              New York metropolitan area and considered  the most intensively
              developed/industrialized estuary on the  US east coast.    The proposed
              research will acquire multitemporal/multisensor  data from SeaWIFS, AVIRIS,
              field spectroradiometer and  associated discrete water sampling.  Based on
              these  measurements optical water quality models will be  constructed linking
              the water constituent concentrations to  the inherent optical properties (IOP),
              using the specific  inherent optical properties (SIOP), to the subsurface 
              (ir)radiance reflectance.  This will minimize the need for  simultaneous remote
              sensing data acquisition and large scale  in situ sampling.  All that will be
              necessary during the  AVIR flight is the accurate measurement of up and 
              downwelling (ir)radiance, and limited in situ measurements  for verification. 
              Three approaches will be used to develop  remote sensing algorithms for this
              project (in increasing  order of importance): (1) a spectral library approach;
              (2) a  derivative analysis approach; and (3) an analytical  algorithm approach
              based on bio-optical modeling and  Radiative Transfer Theory (RTT).  ***
