Abstract    :
                9806299  Myers    This project aims for greater understanding of point defect 
              formation in ZnSe and associated alloys including a fundamental  understanding
              of the nature of the point defect(s) and point  defect complexes as well as
              defect origins during growth. Initial  studies will focus on ZnSe, with
              subsequent efforts including  ZnMgSe alloys. The approach combines molecular
              beam epitaxial  growth; quantitative measurement of point defect concentrations
               in epilayers using electron paramagnetic resonance; detailed 
              photoluminescence studies; and, in parallel with the experimental  techniques,
              a first principles approach to modeling defects in  ZnSe.  %%%  The project
              addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having
              high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials
              science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of
              electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow
              atomic  level observation of materials defects and their origins which  when
              better understood will allow advances in both fundamental  science and
              technology. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is
              expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced
              devices and circuits by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
              designing  and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An 
              important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education
              through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically
              significant area.  ***.
