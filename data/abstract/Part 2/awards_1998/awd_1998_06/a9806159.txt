Abstract    :
                      9806159  Foley  The focus of this POWRE proposal is to study a novel
              plant protein called Vein1 that has been shown to specifically bind nickel. 
              Low levels of many heavy metals are essential for plant growth while heavy
              metal toxicity is a pressing agricultural and environmental problem.  For
              example, excess nickel is a potent inhibitor of growth, development and various
              other metabolic processes in plants with the symptoms including retarded
              growth.  On the other hand nickel is also an essential micronutrient in plants
              and nickel deficiency can result in cell death at the tips of young leaves. 
              The mechanism by which nickel is metabolized and transported in the plant is
              poorly understood.  In addition to being able to bind nickel, Vein1 has
              interesting expression patterns.  Vein1 RNA is specifically expressed in the
              phloem but only in the aerial parts of the plant.  The phloem is part of the
              vascular system and plays a major role in transporting organic material and
              some mineral ions throughout the plant.  This proposal's aims are to generate
              polyclonal antibodies against Vein1 and use these antibodies to determine which
              phloem cell types express Vein1 and establish if Vein1 binds nickel within the
              plant.  These experiments will provide further insight into the function of
              this novel, phloem specific protein and it's role in nickel metabolism.  This
              project is well suited for a POWRE award because it will allow the PI to focus
              full time on a research project that will develop into an independent research
              program.
