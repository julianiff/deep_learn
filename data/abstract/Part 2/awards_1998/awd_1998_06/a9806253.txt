Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9806253  KRAMER    The explosion of information technology is
              occurring through out the world, led by the United States.  Very little is
              understood about the social, economic and industrial implications of this
              societal transformation effecting virtually everyone.  Research is necessary to
              provide information in the innovation, design, evaluation and support of
              product and services, provide guidelines to user organizations in the adoption,
              investment and application decisions; and data of value to policy makers in
              guiding and controlling this explosive growth.    A planning grant
              (EEC-9612648) has shown that an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) for Information Technology and Organizations at the University of
              California, Irvine is economically viable.  Initially companies have become
              members.    The research agenda of this I/UCRC will address:  The Use and
              Impact of Intelligent Technology; the Management of Intelligent Technology, and
              the Design and Implementation of Intelligent Technology.      The Principal
              Investigator and I/UCRC Director and his colleagues are internationally
              recognized researchers in this area and qualified to manager this I/UCRC.
