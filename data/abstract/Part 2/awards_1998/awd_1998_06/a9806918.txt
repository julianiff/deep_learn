              Abstract  ATM-9806918  Kutzbach, John E.  University of Wisconsin  Title: The
              Evolution of Climate and Biosphere During the Past 20  Million Years    Studies
              of the Earth's history show that the large climate changes  of the past have
              been associated with equally large changes in the  biosphere, the deep ocean,
              the large continental ice sheets, and  the earth's carbon cycle.  This award
              supports a study of large  climate changes of the past using numerical models
              of the  atmosphere, the land surface, terrestrial ecosystems, oceans, ice- 
              sheets, and components of the carbon cycle.  In the past, large  climate
              changes were initiated by tectonically-related changes in  land-ocean
              distribution, by the rise and fall of mountains, and by  changes in earth's
              orbital parameters.  By prescribing changes in  these "external" forcings of
              climate, it is possible to use models  to simulate the climate's direct
              response , and to study possible  feedback mechanisms involving the biosphere,
              or the cryosphere that  might amplify or dampen the direct response.  The great
              advantage  of using the past as a "testing ground" for studies of climate 
              change is that geological records from terrestrial and marine  environments can
              be compared with the results of the simulations to  evaluate the accuracy of
              the models.  The specific testing ground  chosen for this study is the most
              recent major glaciation that  began about 20 million years ago.  Large changes
              in the atmospheric  concentration of CO2 probably played a role in situation
              and will  be an important focus of the project.  The results of this work  will
              lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in  this  large
              climate changes of the past and will help assess the  accuracy of models being
              developed to estimate possible climate  changes of the future.
