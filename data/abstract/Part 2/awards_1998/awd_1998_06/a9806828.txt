This research project is the establishment of first
              large-scale and detailed census plot of a forest in the Amazon Basin.  It will
              serve as the baseline for long term studies of tree growth, populations, forest
              composition and diversity, and how these respond to changes in climate in what
              appears to be the world's most species-rich forest. We are completing the
              inventory of trees and shrubs in 25 hectares of hyper-diverse rainforest in
              Yasuni National Park in eastern Ecuador.  Other funds allowed us to establish
              the plot and initiate the census.  The tree mapping, measuring, labeling, and
              computer data entry of each individual is now nearly complete for the
              approximately 150,000 trees in the plot.  The current funds allow us to finish
              the much more difficult task of identification in the field of the more than
              1,000 species of trees, most of which have never been studied before.  The
              Ecuador plot is part of a broader program of large and permanent inventories in
              key tropical forest sites.  There are now 12 such forest dynamics plots around
              the world, strategically placed to represent a wide range of climates and
              soils, and already yielding important information on tropical forest resources,
              forest management, and effects of climate change.  The data is made available
              to and widely used by scientists throughout the world as well as in the host
              country.  This is the first such plot in the continent of South America.
