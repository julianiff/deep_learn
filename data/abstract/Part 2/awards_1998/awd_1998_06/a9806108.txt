POWRE/CISE:  Geometric
              Algorithms for Landmark-Based Mobile Robot Navigation

This work is a unique
              opportunity for the PI, who is a young researcher in a small liberal arts
              college, to develop a research program in a promising new domain.  The
              objective is to develop geometric algorithms for mobile robot navigation based
              on visual landmarks.  The specific concern is for the development of efficient
              new geometric algorithms, new strategies for navigation using visual landmarks,
              partial model building by geometric learning, and considerations of real-world
              uncertainty.  The long-term goals of the research include the development of
              task-level strategies for navigation in an environment without a global map
              using landmarks and simple landmark adjacency maps.
