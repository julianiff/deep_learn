              Abstract    Proposal Number:  CTS-9806265    Principal Investigator:  Hanratty  
               This is a grant to continue research on turbulence generated by flow over a
              solid boundary.  The goals are the determination of how turbulence is produced,
              of how to control and change turbulence, of how to predict Reynolds stresses. 
              An important feature of the research is that it uses direct numerical
              simulations (DNS), pulsed-image velocimetry (PIV), two-component laser-Doppler
              velocimetry (LDV), and a specially constructed facility for optical studies of
              turbulence.  The chief thrust is to develop a conceptual framework for wall
              turbulence which can be used to analyze complex flows and to determine how
              turbulence can be modified.  The approach taken is to consider the structure
              and dynamics of stress producing eddies.  Studies will be made of (1) "simple"
              wall turbulence, such as fully developed flow in a channel, (2) flow over a
              stationary or moving wavy boundary, (3) flow of solutions of drag-reducing
              polymers or surfactants, (4) flows over structured boundaries, (5) flows with
              large amplitude imposed oscillations.     1      1
