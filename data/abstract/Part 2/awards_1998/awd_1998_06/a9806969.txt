Abstract    :
              In many parts of the world indigenous or minority ethnic communities are
              struggling with national states to preserve some local autonomy and identity. 
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at the
              University of Pittsburgh studies how an indigenous community in Nicaragua is
              involved in ethnic resistance, meaning the struggle against the national state
              for recognition of their cultural independence.  The hypotheses to be tested is
              that women have played an active role in ethnic struggles, even though their
              activities have not appeared in accounts.  By gathering and analyzing oral
              traditions, personal narratives and historical accounts of the community's
              struggle for ethnic rights and identity, the student will examine how the
              struggle for women's rights and identity has been intertwined with the larger
              political struggle. The methods include participant observation and extended
              interviews with community members.  The new knowledge to be created by this
              project will advance our understanding of how gender identity and ethnic
              identity intersect in indigenous communities.  In addition it will increase our
              knowledge about this important region of the world and contribute to the
              training of a young scientist.
