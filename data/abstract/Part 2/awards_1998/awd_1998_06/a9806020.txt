Fuson

This proposal follows up Fuson's previous NSF RTL grant. 
              That research focused on cultural and social contexts of urban Latino
              childeren's addition and subtraction learning.  It traced multiple paths of
              children's construction of addition, subtraction, place value, and
              problem-solving understanding within primary-school classrooms.  These
              classrooms contained social, material, linguistic, and cultural supports that
              we designed and continually adapted for such construction.
