Abstract    :
              Common property resources are much less fragile than the `tragedy of the
              commons` model suggests, and ecological anthropologists have contributed many
              valuable case studies of native or local community management systems which
              maintain such resources. This dissertation research project by an anthropology
              student from Pennsylvania State University studies a fishing community in
              Belize. The project's objective is to measure the relationships between lobster
              fishermen's lending and investment behavior, household composition, and fishing
              behavior.  Hypotheses will be tested based on models predicting that lending
              and investment strategies and household composition influence fishing behavior,
              especially the harvest of under-sized lobsters.  Methods include participant
              observation, informal-unstructured and structured interviews, and a census. The
              contribution of the project will be to advance the general theory dealing with
              the success and failure of local community resource management institutions and
              practices.  The results from this study will be valuable to theorists and
              policy planners concerned with the management of common property resources.
