The objectives of the PI are to extend the ongoing
              study of logic and computer science to the application of these disciplines to
              real-world problems.  The work proposed here is a three-faceted pursuit
              continuing the inclusion of the well-founded and stable logic programming
              semantics in the realm of inductive logic programming.  First, the questions of
              the benefit of this synthesis will be further explored.  Second, the computer
              system which the PI has developed in her dissertion work will be improved and
              augmented.  Lastly, and most importantly, stable inductive logic programming
              will be applied to the real-world problems of Lyme disease diagnosis and the
              classification of the secondary structure proteins.
