POWRE:  Efficient Geometric Algorithms for Computer Simulated
              Environments

This proposal aims at establishing research activities of the
              PI who is restarting academic career after academic career interruption due to
              family reasons.  The proposed activities explore a relatively new research area
              for the PI which naturally complements PI's prior accomplishments.  The
              emphasis is on the development of efficient and accurate algorithms and
              software systems and on demonstration of their application.  The set of
              proposed research problems includes: (i) collision detection between non-convex
              objects and non-linear models using higher-order bounding volumes and dynamics
              data structures (ii) multi-resolution free-from deformation for modeling
              elastic bodies and (iii) applications to virtual prototyping and
              physically-based modeling.
