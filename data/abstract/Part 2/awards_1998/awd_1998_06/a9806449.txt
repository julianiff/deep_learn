Abstract    :
              Grant   9806449    This award will be used to mobilize a quick response to the
              El Nino event that has developed in the central Pacific this winter. Dr. Grant
              and his students have been studying the birds of the Galapagos Islands for more
              than 20 years.  It is expected that this El Nino event, predicted to be one of
              the largest on record, will result in a dramatically prolonged breeding season
              for Galapagos finches on the Galapagos Islands. This extended period of
              favorable conditions may have dramatic effects on the population size and
              demography of the study populations. Dr. Grant will test hypotheses concerning
              a) the heritability of life history traits, b) variation in age-specific
              fitness of hybrid birds, c) the fitness of inbred birds, d) the genetic
              structure of the two rarest populations which have recently experienced
              demographic and possibly genetic bottlenecks, and e) paternity of young birds
              estimated by observations of adults at nests. This study may provide novel
              insights to the mechanisms associated with evolutionary response to rapidly
              changing environmental conditions.
