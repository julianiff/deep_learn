This award is to develop a
              better understanding of transitional turbulent flows and turbulent flows in
              complex geometries with heat transfer by employing direct and large eddy
              numerical simulations.  Turbulence is one of the important unresolved problems
              in engineering and science.  Despite the fact that there is an urgent need for
              better methods to predict the thermal features of turbulent flow in complex
              engineering systems, no workable general theory is currently available.  The
              objectives of this proposed work are to: 1) improve subgrid-scale and numerical
              modeling for flows in complex geometries; 2) expand the capabilities of large
              eddy simulation technology to supply new information for higher Reynolds number
              flows.  The simulations will be based on a preconditioned finite volume
              discretization to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.  This
              approach is novel in its use of low Mach number preconditioning applied to
              fully incompressible flows.  The research will focus on  studying by-pass and
              separation bubble transition and film cooling in turbines.
