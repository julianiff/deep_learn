Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support the UCLA Zooarchaeology Laboratory will
              acquire a comparative fish collection. The laboratory currently identifies
              faunal remains recovered during the excavation of archaeological sites, many of
              which are located in California. To conduct this work effectively it is
              necessary to have skeletons from known species for comparative purposes and the
              present  laboratory collection is minimally adequate. While more than 700
              species of fish are known present in California waters only 150-200 appear in
              archaeological sites and Dr. Arnold and her collaborators will focus on these
              species. They plan to add roughly 300 specimens to their current holdings.
              Because some species exhibit sexual dimorphism in many cases more than one
              specimen is necessary. Materials will be collected from a number of sources
              including commercial fisherman, fish markets and power and pumping facilities
              (which recover large numbers of fish when they flush out their cooling delivery
              systems). The specimens will be macerated, and the clean de-greased skeletal
              elements will be numbered and incorporated into the collection.  In some areas
              of coastal California such as the Channel Islands and adjacent mainland
              prehistoric Native American cultures reached a level of sedentization and
              cultural complexity highly unusual for hunting and gathering societies. They
              produced wealth items which were widely traded and which probably were made by
              craft specialists. Reliance on fish which offered a rich a relatively stable
              diet played an important role in this process. Extensive marine research has
              allowed reconstruction of changes in post Pleistocene water temperature and
              related productivity and archaeologists wish to examine cultural response to
              these changing conditions. Faunal materials recovered through archaeological
              excavation provide an important data base for addressing such issues and the
              comparative collection to be amassed will significantly assist in this work.
