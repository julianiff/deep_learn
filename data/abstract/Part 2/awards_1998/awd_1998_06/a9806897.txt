Abstract    :
                                                    9806897  Olowolafe    This SGER project
              will explore a unique approach to forming low  resistance ohmic contacts
              between metals and p-type silicon  carbide. The approach is to modify the
              metal-p-type SiC interface  with the introduction of a thin epitaxial layer of
              p-Si  containing 1% carbon, and forming a p-Si(1%C)/p-SiC  heterojunction.
              Carbon is incorporated in the p-Si to prevent out  diffusion of C from the
              p-SiC substrate, i.e., to ensure  stability of the Si/SiC interface during
              processing.  Metals with  workfunctions higher than Si(4.9 eV) will then be
              deposited onto  the p-Si(1%C) side of the structure. It is expected that this 
              layered structure would allow the degree of electronic band  bending at the
              interfaces to be tailored in such a way as to  enhance hole conduction in
              either direction, depending on bias  polarity. Characterization includes RBS,
              TEM, X-Ray, and  current/voltage evaluation.  %%%  This project will explore a
              new and innovative approach to ohmic  contact formation to silicon carbide. 
              The idea being explored  involves the fabrication of an epitaxial layer of
              material  between the silicon carbide and metal with electronic 
              characteristics which allow low resistance current flow. The  project sets
              specific goals and methods for an initial study to  test these ideas, and
              several key issues can be appropriately  addressed and resolved by the project.
