This is a collaborative study is by
              scientists at Bentley College and Universities of Vermont and Colorado on the
              Wisconsinan glacial history of Cumberland Sound on southern Baffin Island to
              gain a better understanding of the Laurentide ice sheet.  Scientific
              understanding of the Climatic and glacial history of the Cumberland Sound is
              currently undergoing a major revision but significant geochronological
              uncertainties still remain.  Cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages for 139 samples
              from moraines and bedrock surfaces sampled along the Pangnirtung Pass and Fjord
              suggest that the glacier advanced from the interior of Cumberland Peninsula
              between 25-10 million years ago (ka) and then rapidly retreated 10-7 ka to near
              present-day ice margins.  These date appear to be in conflict with pre-late
              Wisconsinan radiocarbon ages from basal lake sediments.  Preliminary cosmogenic
              nuclide data for a limited number of samples suggest similar timing for
              glaciation of the outer part of Cumberland Sound, but appear to conflict with
              younger radiocarbon results from marine sediment cores.  Additional previously
              collected cosmogenic nuclide samples will be processed and analyzed to further
              investigate these discrepancies, with the goal of improving the chronology of
              glaciation in the Cumberland Sound region.  Discordant 26 Al/10Be exposure ages
              from upland areas surrounding the Pangnirtung Fjord, indicate these areas have
              a long and complex burial and exposure history, with the likely presence of
              cold-based ice on the uplands while warm-based ice filled the Pangnirtung Fjord
              and Cumberland Sound during the late Wisconsinan.  Analyses of these additional
              samples will more precisely determine the vertical extent of the late
              Wisconsinan in the Pangnirtung Fjord area and test whether similar
              glaciological conditions existed further to the southeast.
