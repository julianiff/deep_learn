Abstract    :
              Shaw  DEB 9806955    Byophytes occupy a pivotal position among land plants
              because they are the only land plants in which the haploid gametophyte stage
              rather than the diploid sporophyte stage of the life cycle is dominant and
              because their reproductive system relies on water for movement of sperm to
              eggs.  In that context, they can be thought of as the "amphibia of plants,"
              marking the transition between aquatic and completely terrestrial organisms.  
              The mosses are by far the largest groups of bryophytes, with some 12,000
              species.  The evolution of moss structural characteristics, including
              chromosome number, is poorly understood despite the importance of bryophytes
              for a general understanding of plant diversity.  This project will investigate
              the relationships among species in the large moss family Orthotrichaceae.  The
              Orthotrichaceae are represented on every continent, and are diverse components
              of both tropical and temperate ecosystems.  This research will combine
              molecular analyses of variation at the DNA level with studies of reproductive
              biology, chromosome numbers and structure, and comparative anatomy of whole
              plants.  Results of these combined analyses will shed new light on the
              relationship between biological characteristics such as reproductive biology
              and changes in chromosome number, and rates of molecular diversification as
              estimated by differences in DNA  structure among closely related and more
              distantly related species.
