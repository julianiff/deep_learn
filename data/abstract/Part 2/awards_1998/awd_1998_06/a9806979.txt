Abstract    :
              9806979  Glass  This is an award to provide support for a project to conduct 
              preliminary studies related to development of a competitive research  project
              that will address lack of knowledge relating to the materials  balance of
              intermediate gases produced during microbial-based  treatment processes for
              denitrification of municipal and wastewater.    The investigator plans on
              designing a system for analysis of nitric  oxide and nitrous oxide production
              during denitrification and collect  sufficient information to provide the basis
              for a competitive research  proposal.    The proposal leading to this award
              meets the criteria for the Minority  Planing Grant Program as described in NSF
              94-147.  ***
