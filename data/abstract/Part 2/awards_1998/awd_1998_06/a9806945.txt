Abstract    :
              Campbell   DEB-9806945    This project will investigate the evolutionary
              relationships within the large and important rose family.  This group of plants
              contains numerous commercially valuable fruits (apples, pears, strawberries,
              cherries, peaches, plums, blackberries, and raspberries) and many
              horticulturally significant plants (roses, cotoneaster, lady's mantle,
              bridle-wreath, flowering quince, fire-thorn, cinqfoil, and others).  Despite
              the large and important role that these plants play in our daily lives and
              scientific interest, we do not have a clear view of the evolutionary
              relationships of members of the family.  A primary reason for this situation is
              that insufficient evidence has been accumulated to adequately address the
              problem.  A primary aim of Dr. Campbell's project is to gather DNA sequence
              data to provide a reliable chronicle of evolutionary history in this group. 
              These data will be compared with structural, chemical, and other data that have
              been accumulated by Dr. Campbell and other researchers to create an overall
              picture of evolutionary relationships in the family.  Such knowledge will
              establish a framework for studies of key groups within the family, provide
              insights into the evolution of interesting features in the family (such as the
              fruits), and contribute to our overall understanding or plant evolution.
