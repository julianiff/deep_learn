The purpose of this project is to collaborate with Chinese
              scientists to collect, analyze, and interpret geodetic data on crustal
              deformation in China.  It is essential to acquire accurate crustal deformation
              information in order to understand the intra-plate dynamics of the east Eurasia
              plate.   The investigators will assist the Chinese on the realization of their
              "Crustal Movement  Monitoring Network of China" project, under which a huge GPS
              network is being established.  The team will provide consultation and
              assistance to the Chinese about their network design, hardware and software
              installation, and automation of the data acquisition system.  They will also
              provide personnel training and work collaboratively with the Chinese scientists
              to process and analyze the initial phase of the GPS data set being collected
              this year.  These important data will be available to U.S. scientists.
