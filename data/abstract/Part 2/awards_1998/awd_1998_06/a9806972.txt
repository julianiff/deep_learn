Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CATE  9806972    This Interagency Agreement supports activities of
              the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead
              agency role.  These activities include editing and preparation of the camera
              copy of the Spring and Fall 1998 and 1999 issues of the Journal, Arctic
              Research of the United States.  The Journal serves an essential step in
              fulfilling the requirements of Public Law 98-373, the Arctic Research and
              Policy Act.  It contains information on research activities of the Federal
              agencies involved in the Arctic and report and minutes of meetings from the
              Arctic Research Commission and IARPC.  Under this agreement, CRREL also
              provides editorial support services for the U.S. Arctic Research Plan and the
              IARPC Report to Congress.
