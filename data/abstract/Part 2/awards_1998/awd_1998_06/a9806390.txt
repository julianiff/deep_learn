These investigators propose to develop, use, and evaluate a
              real-time nowcast /forecast system for the Georges Bank region. The scope of
              the system will include physical and biological variables relevant to the
              circulation and target species within the USGLOBEC Northwest Atlantic program.
              The intent is to provide networked capability for assimilating in-situ
              observations (from ship, moored and drifting instruments, as well as remotely
              sensed observations) into simulation models to provide the best estimate of the
              physical and ecological state of the ocean; to utilize networkavailable
              atmospheric forecasts to produce a circulation forecast; to examine the
              implications of the forecast on the ecology; and to guide the adjustment of the
              experimental protocol to maximize its relevance for cruise-specific goals. The
              system will be built from established and emerging GLOBEC tools for simulating
              and hindcasting Georges Bank. 

Our central hypothesis is that real-time
              forecasts are possible for detailed coupled physical/biological phenomena, with
              sufficient skill to allow adjustment of the observational protocol. This will
              be tested in an energetic and complex multi-frontal system, in the operational
              context of contemporary experiments about the coupled biophysical system
              itself.
