              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS-9806110    Principal Investigator: S. Grace    
               A POWRE Award:  The goal is to develop a method for calculating the acoustic
              field associated with unsteady flow fields.  The proposed research will enable
              the acoustic portion of a complicated flow field to be identified as a step in
              a CFD calculation of the flow, even when the original CFD computation is valid
              only for incompressible flow.  The method is based upon a unique splitting of
              the field variables into vortical, acoustic, and entropy modes, even in the
              presence of non-linearities.  The method will be tested on two flows:  flow
              past a cavity; flow from a turbulent jet.  This POWRE award will enable the PI
              to focus on a new research area and to take advantage of collaboration with
              French researchers at a critical point in her academic career.
