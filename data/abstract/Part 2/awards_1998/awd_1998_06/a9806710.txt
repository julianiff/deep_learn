Abstract    :
              9806710  Kambhampati    The wood-feeding cockroach genus, Cryptocercus, is the
              sole  representative of the family Cryptocercidae and is generally considered
              to  be among the basal lineages of extant cockroaches.  At present, four 
              species are recognized worldwide within the genus. The distribution of 
              Cryptocercus in the U.S. is disjunct, with a set of populations distributed 
              along the Appalachian Mountains and another along the coastal mountains in  the
              Pacific Northwest.  All Cryptocercus in the eastern U.S. are presently 
              classified as a single species.  However, recent evidence based on DNA 
              sequence analysis, chromosome analysis and mating studies indicated that  there
              may be as many as four species of Cryptocercus in the U.S.  Subsequent analysis
              of DNA sequence of the nuclear rRNA genes and ITS2  confirmed the results based
              on sequence analysis of mitochondrial rRNA  genes.  Given the existence of 4 or
              more Cryptocercus species in the U.S.,  the overall objective of the proposed
              studies is to delineate their  geographical and biological boundaries.  The
              specific objectives of the  proposed research are: (1) Characterize sequence
              variation in mitochondrial  rRNA genes within and among populations of
              Cryptocercus.  (2) Characterize  chromosome number variation among populations
              of Cryptocercus. (3) Develop  formal descriptions and morphological keys for
              the new species of  Cryptocercus.  Samples with different karyotypes will be
              examined to  identify consistent and fixed morphological differences that can
              be used  for identification of the new Cryptocercus species and possibly in 
              cladistic analysis along with the DNA sequences. Together, these studies  will
              be a comprehensive analysis of species boundaries using multiple  quantitative
              criteria.
