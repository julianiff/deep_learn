Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded by the Division of Chemistry supports the research and
              educational activities of Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue University.  The
              research aims to study self-reproducing, autocatalytic as well as
              cross-catalytic systems in which four peptide fragments will be used to produce
              four potential coiled-coil products.  Amplification of one product over the
              other will be accomplished by using cross-catalytic peptide templates and by
              modulating the environmental conditions within the reaction, such as pH or salt
              concentration.  The coiled-coil studies will be extended into the area of
              self-replicating helix-turn-helix peptides.

The opportunity afforded through
              the POWRE program will enhance Professor Chmielewski's research potential as
              well as her educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
              scientists.  The results of this research will allow the PI to pursue a new
              line of inquiry which falls within the framework of her present research area,
              self-replicating peptides.  Investigation of the self-replicating capabilities
              of molecules other than DNA and RNA should result in new advances in a wide
              range of biotechnology disciplines.
