Experimental
              Software Systems:  Models and Tools for Requirements Engineering:  Experiments
              in WinWin

With the rapid changes in the marketplace, a central task of
              requirements engineering (RE) is becoming one of conceptual support for change
              management.  RE is challenged to provide a framework for multi-disciplinary
              stakeholders to collaborate, understand, and negotiate on change, as well as to
              serve as a framework for the changes to be realized in the real world via the
              design and implementation tasks.  The WinWin research project investigates
              models and their automated support tools that address the above challenges.  In
              particular, the research investigates (a) Models of the RE tasks and processes
              by capitalizing on the opportunity to use an existing tool, called WinWin, as
              an instrument to collect data on RE activity in real-client projects involving
              various sites, domains, clients, and project teams, and (b) Automated support
              for the RE tasks by capitalizing on the opportunity to build on the WinWin tool
              as an experimental distributed RE support tool that mediates multi-stakeholders
              concerns and the RE context of such concerns.  The expected results will
              provide a significant new level of visibility into the tasks and processes of
              RE as a framework for collaborating and negotiating on change and the types of
              in-process models and products and their role in change management and
              negotiation.
