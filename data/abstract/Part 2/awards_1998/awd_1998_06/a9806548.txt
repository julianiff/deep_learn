Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9806548  D. Leighton, Univ. of Notre Dame  This award will provide
              partial travel support for approximately 25 speakers at the 7th NSF Workshop on
              the Flow of Particulates and Fluids in Santa Barbara, February 23-25, 1998. 
              This is a grantees meeting.  Evaluation of the current research results and
              improving inter-university and university-industry interactions in particulate
              multiphase flows are the main objectives.   The papers will include
              experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies, and will focus on overviews
              of the respective research group in the last year.   Overviews of  the NSF,
              ONR, NASA and AFOSR multiphase flow programs will be presented, and grantees
              from those agencies have been invited.  A session will be dedicated to
              university-industry interaction, and another to research trends and
              opportunities.  The conference proceedings will be prepared following the
              meeting, and made available through the National Technical Information System,
              U.S. Department of Commerce.  ***
