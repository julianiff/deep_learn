Abstract    :
              9806882  Tsukruk  Partial support is provided for a symposium on the 
              microstructure and microtribology of polymeric surfaces, to  be held at the
              216th American Chemical Society National  Meeting, August 23-27, 1998.  The
              symposium will focus on  recent advances in the understanding of polymer
              tribology at  the nano-scale level, including polymer composites,  coatings,
              and ultrathin molecular films and layers, and will  attempt to bridge the gap
              between microstructural and  macroscopic surface properties.  The meeting will
              bring  together nano-tribology experts, contact mechanicists and  polymer
              chemists to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas  and development of
              synergistic interactions between the  various constituencies.  ***
