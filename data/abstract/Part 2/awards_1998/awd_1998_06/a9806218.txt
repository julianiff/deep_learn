POWRE/CISE:  Effects of
              Systematic Data Error on Inductive Machine Learning Algorithms

Proposed
              research is a change of direction for the PI, and provides her with an
              opportunity to switch from applied research to theoretical aspects of machine
              learning.  The objective is to study the effects of systematic data error on
              inductive machine learning algorithms.   The work proposed will begin to
              characterize the effects of systematic error both analytically and empirically.
              It will incorporate development of a model for analyzing worst case effects of
              data error on decision tree learners.  One of the objectives of the study is to
              increase the involvement of undergraduates in research and  provide them with 
              an opportunity to obtain active research experience.
