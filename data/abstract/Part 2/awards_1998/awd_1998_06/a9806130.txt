Northeastern Russia is a seismically active region with neotectonic
              deformation from the interaction of the North American and Eurasian plate
              boundaries and a series of small blocks between them.  The plate and block
              interactions result in high levels of seismicity, uplift, faulting, and local
              rifting.  The specific area that the Principal Investigator will examine in
              detail is in the Chersky Range and Koryak Highlands.  These areas include the
              pole of rotation that lies along the North American and Eurasian plate
              boundaries, large rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean, and one of the most
              seismically active regions within the North American plate.  The Principal
              Investigator will use a unique, previously inaccessible data set that was
              collected during the past five years through the Michigan State University
              -University of Alaska-Fairbanks cooperative program with institutes in eastern
              Russia.  These data sets consist of seismic phase data from the Yakutian and
              Magadam regional networks for the period 1980-1995, bulletins with phase data
              for larger earthquakes in continental eastern Russia for 1970-1990, complete
              ex-military topographic map coverage at a scale of 1:200,000, geologic maps at
              scales of 1:500,000 and 1:1,500,000, satellite images, and information on
              faulting and earthquake-induced features.  Results from this proposed study
              should provide a better understanding of intra-continental deformation in
              convergent plate boundaries, improved hazard assessment, documentation of the
              sources and nature of sediments flowing into the Arctic Ocean, and
              identification of smaller regions for field study.
