Abstract    :
              9806429  Katz    The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables  U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of research
              abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental 
              conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral
              research  visit by Dr. Alexander Katz to work with Dr. Mir Wais  Hosseini at
              the Institute Le Bel, University Louis Pasteur  in Strasbourg, France.    This
              project involves the supramolecular synthesis of enzyme-  mimicking materials. 
              They will use metallorganic molecules  as building blocks for engineering
              catalytic sites. The PI  will incorporate catalytic molecules into a metal
              oxide  framework for rigidity and to protect the active site.  The  catalytic
              reactions can emulate the naturally occurring  catalytic reactions of enzymes
              and antibodies. This will  lead to the engineering and construction of more
              intricate  and complex catalytic sites.      Dr. Mir Wais Hosseini is
              internationally renowned for  developing self-assembling organic systems.  His
              lab is  known as a mecca for supramolecular chemistry.    ***
