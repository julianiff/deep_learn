Abstract    :
              9806052  Peric  A POWRE award will enable the PI to perform advanced 
              geotechnical tests at the Geotechnical Laboratory of  Northwestern University,
              utilizing a plane strain apparatus.  The project concentrates on elucidation of
              two major  features of progressive failure of overconsolidated clays:  material
              properties and failure mechanism.  The primary  objectives are to develop
              diagnostic failure analysis that  will enable systematization of major
              laboratory and in situ  soil strength tests by ranking them according to their 
              degree of susceptibility in instabilities and localization;  and to closely
              observe and investigate the mechanisms of  plane strain deformation of
              overconsolidated clays.  Subsequent numerical simulations will explore whether
              the  plane strain experiments can be successfully used for the  extraction of
              constitutive properties.  The classification  of the laboratory testes will
              utilize the notions of  homogeneously deforming samples as opposed to boundary
              value  problems.  It will improve the method of selection of soil  strength
              parameters for design purposes.  The project will  further the career of the PI
              by extensively in her  publications, thus enabling her to develop a balanced 
              combination of theoretical and experimental expertise in her  field.  ***
