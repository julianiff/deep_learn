Abstract    :
              9806055  Hirschmugl  This project focuses on unraveling energy decay pathways
              for  adsorbate vibrations and studying low energy dynamics during  growth of
              wide band gap materials. Far infrared reflection  absorption spectroscopy
              (Far-IRAS) of molecules adsorbed at ionic  surfaces will be utilized to
              directly measure vibrational  lineshapes. Real-time Far-IRAS measurements
              during in-situ growth  of thin oxide films on metallic and insulating
              substrates is also  included in the study. Frequency-dependent conductivity and
               lattice vibrations will be measured, providing electronic and  morphological
              information simultaneously. The infrared  measurements will be augmented by
              conventional surface analytical  techniques, including LEED, RHEED, AES, and
              TPD.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional 
              Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The
              research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a fundamental
              level.
