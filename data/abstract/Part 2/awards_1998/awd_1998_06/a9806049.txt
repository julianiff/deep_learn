Abstract    :
              9806049  This proposal was submitted to the NSF-wide Professional  Opportunities
              for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The proposal requests
              funding for research to  quantify relationships between hydrodynamic
              characteristics  of seagrass canopies and the geochemistry of underlying 
              sediments. The PI hypothesizes that this relationship could  affect
              distribution of seagrasses. The PI plans to collect  seagrass samples from
              along the East Coast and 1) determine  the range of permeablililties of
              sediments colonized by  seagrasses, 2) evaluate the effect of seagrasses on
              pore  water fluxes at different current velocities and seagrass  densities; and
              3) quantify the hydrodynamic mediated  intrusion of particulate matter into
              permeable sediments  colonized by seagrasses.  Some work will be performed in 
              collaboration with Dr. Markus Huettel using his  recirculating flume at the Max
              Plank Institute in Bremen,  Germany.
