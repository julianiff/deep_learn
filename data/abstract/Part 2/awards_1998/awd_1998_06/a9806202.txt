The objectives of this research are to perform pilot
              experiments to begin to test the validity of recently developed theoretical
              models of bone fluid flow and electrical signal transduction in the
              lacunar-canalicular porosity of bone.  These experiments include exploring
              novel methods to:  (1) measure the microstructural electrical potentials and
              bone fluid flow produced in loaded bone tissue samples as a function of loading
              frequency, and (2) quantify the resulting transmembrane and intracellular
              potentials that pass down the processes of the osteocytic bone cells.  This
              research is appropriate for the POWRE program because it will permit the
              principal investigator to become established in a new area of research which
              will further her career advancement.
