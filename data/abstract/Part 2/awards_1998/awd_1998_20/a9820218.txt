Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond  in the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon.   The ten participants,
              recruited nationally, will take part in an extremely successful program that
              encourages undergraduate Chemistry and Physics majors to pursue graduate
              degrees in chemical physics/physical chemistry.  Students are selected based on
              a strong background in both chemistry and physics and their desire to combine
              the two disciplines in their future career work.  Twelve research faculty from
              the chemistry and physics departments will be involved in the Site.  in
              addition to the research, the students and supervisors will participate in a
              collective program which includes research seminars, weekly meetings, social
              activities and follow-up activities after students return to their home
              institutions.
