This 12-month project will provide $23,000 for the purpose of
              providing the planning for the submission of a Local Systemic Change in
              Science, 6-12 project.  The project will bring together over 30 school
              districts in southwestern Pennsylvania along with the Carnegie Science Center, 
              Carnegie Mellon University and Automated Cell Technologies.  The planning will
              involve the piloting and determination of which of a set of exemplary materials
              will be used, and designing an integrated program of professional development
              for these districts.  The primary purpose will be to build the coalitions
              necessary to do this work.
