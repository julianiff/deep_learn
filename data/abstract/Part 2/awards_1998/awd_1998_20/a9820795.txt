Simultaneous static and
              dynamic light scattering is proposed to measure heteroaggregation rate
              constants in binary colloidal mixtures.  The experimental study will be
              performed on carboxyl (A) and zwitterionic (B) latex particles.  Absolute
              formation rate constants for all dimers (AA, AB and BB) will be measured as a
              function of solution pH and ionic strength.  The experimental data will be
              compared to the theory of Derjagurin, Landau, Vervey and Overbeek (DLVO).  The
              authors will investigate the limits of validity of DLVO-theory for small
              separation distances (< 1 nm) of the barrier in the particle-particle
              interaction potential, where the theory apparently fails. 
The proposed work
              has relevance to stabilization, coagulation and deposition of colloidal
              particles in various natural and industrial processes such as water
              purification, mineral processing, filtration, transport of microorganisms in
              groundwater and medical applications.
