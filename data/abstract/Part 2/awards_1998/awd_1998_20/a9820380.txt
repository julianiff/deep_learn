Abstract    :
              Because there are so very few minority individuals in plant sciences, minority
              students tend not to perceive plant sciences as a viable career option.  This
              works to perpetuate their underrepresentation unless measures are effected to
              improve their perception of this field.  To address this problem, Dr. Poff and
              his colleagues have designed and implemented a program to acquaint increased
              numbers of minority students with professional career opportunities in the
              plant sciences.  The program has several components, including summer research
              for minority students, for which funding is provided by this grant.  Each
              summer, eight students will be supported for ten weeks of research with a
              faculty mentor in plant sciences.  The students also will participate in social
              and professional-development activities and will visit an industrial
              laboratory.  They will be encouraged to present the results of their research
              at their home institutions and at national meetings.  Recruitment of
              participants is aided by outreach activities of plant-science faculty members
              at Michigan State University, who give one-week courses at predominantly
              minority institutions.  Michigan State also offers a graduate-level course on
              mentoring in a culturally diverse environment.  Of the 26 minority student
              participants in the first 6 years of this program (supported by the Department
              of Energy and other sources), approximately half are working toward
              professional careers in the plant sciences.
