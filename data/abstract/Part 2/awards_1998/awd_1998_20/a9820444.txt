Abstract    :
              EEC-9820444

This project is funded as a part of the EEC initiative on
              Research Centers - Small Firms Collaborative R&D.  The cooperating partners are
              the Center for Micro-Engineered Materials at the University of New Mexico and
              Advanced Ceramics Corp. (ACC), a small firm located in Cleveland, Ohio.  The
              Co-PI's at CMEM and ACC recently discovered a new spherical morphology powder
              form of boron nitride (BN), and they have shown that it has enhanced
              processability in organic polymers.  Based upon these findings, the UNM-CMEM/
              ACC team will engage jointly in comprehensive studies of the synthesis of BN
              microspheres and their processing and utilization in thermal management
              applications.  In particular, the team will:

- study the aerosol assisted
              vapor-phase synthesis (AAVS) parameters that affect BN particle purity, size,  
                  size distribution, surface area and porosity;
- optimize the AAVS process
              yield as a function of chemical feedstocks and process parameters;
-
              characterize the nitridation chemistry and kinetics of the BN particles;
-
              determine the conditions required for process scale-up to pilot plant scale;
-
              chararterize spherical BN powder loading in epoxy polymers;
- evaluate the
              flow characteristics and thermal conductivity of the composites, and 

              complete the necessary financial analyses for pilot plant scale-up.
