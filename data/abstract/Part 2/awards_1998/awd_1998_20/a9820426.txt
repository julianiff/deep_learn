Abstract    :
              This grant will initiate a Research Experience for undergraduates (REU) program
              in physics at Purdue University.  This program would involve 10 undergraduates,
              who would work directly with faculty on research projects in areas including
              astrophysics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and musical
              acoustics.  The program would hold a special colloquium series to introduce the
              students to forefront areas of physics, and sponsor a set of tutorial classes
              to teach theoretical and experimental skills.  The program would culminate with
              a research symposium at which students would give oral presentations describing
              their work.
