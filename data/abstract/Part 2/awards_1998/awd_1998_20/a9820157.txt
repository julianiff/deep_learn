Title: Quaternary
              Paleoclimatic Record from Tropical South America: Drilling the Salar de
              Uyuni

This award supports a project to drill the Salar de Uyuni in order to
              recover a 300-meter long core, representing a history of about 0.5Myr.  The
              core will be analyzed using a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct a
              climatological (effective moisture and temperature) time series of the
              Altiplano.  Dating will be done by 14C, Ar/Ar, and U/Th methods.  Detailed
              studies of the sedimentology, fluid inclusion petrography, stable isotopic and
              elemental geochemistry, and paleobiota (diatoms) will form the basis for the
              climatological reconstruction.  The following majors questions will be
              addressed:  (1) What was the nature of late Pleistocene climate variability in
              tropical South America ?  (2) Was tropical South America wet or dry during
              glacial stages?  (3) Are terrestrial tropical climate changes consistent with
              Milankovitch forcing and are they synchronous with high latitude changes?  What
              climatic mechanisms (e.g. changes in the concentration of atmospheric water
              vapor) are responsible for these changes?  (4) What are the dominant
              frequencies of suborbital-scale climatic changes in the tropics and are these
              variations in the terrestrial tropics synchronous with those at higher
              latitudes?  What climatic mechanisms are responsible for these paleoclimatic
              characteristics
