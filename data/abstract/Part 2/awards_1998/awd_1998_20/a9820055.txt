This award to San Jose State University Foundation will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Point Sur, a research
              vessel operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes a retrofit for the acoustic Doppler
              current meter, two transmissometers, a color printer, a debubbler, a continuous
              flow cuvette, a laser printer and a remote data display. The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly along the California margin, in 1999 and future years.
