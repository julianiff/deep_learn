Abstract    :
              	A family of models of diffusion-limited nonequilibrium kinetics is proposed,
              which can be analyzed exactly with the method of "empty intervals".  The
              models, and their method of analysis, are important because of the lack of an
              exact coherent approach to reaction-diffusion systems in general.  It is
              anticipated that the proposed research will result in deeper understanding of
              reaction kinetics, and will contribute also to questions in applied math,
              regarding the analysis of partial differential equations.
