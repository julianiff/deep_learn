This proposal
              seeks funds to continue the NSF-REU Site Program that has been administered for
              the past six years in the Department of  Chemical Engineering at the University
              of Colorado.  The focus of this NSF-REU program is membrane and thin film
              science, which has been identified as a 
critical need in an NSF Workshop
              report, three NRC reports, and by a past AICHE President.     
As such, the
              students participating in this REU Site Program work on research associated
              with 
the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Separations
              Using Thin Films 
(CSTF) for which the PI is Co-Founder and Co-Director.  Both
              Co-Directors are award winning 
educators who have extensive experience in
              mentoring undergraduate research programs.  The 
principal objective of this
              Site Program is to encourage promising students, in particular women,
              
minority, and physically disadvantaged students, to go on to graduate school
              in order to pursue careers in engineering research.  The students to be
              accepted into this program and the intended 
impact can be best judged from
              the statistics and outcomes of our prior NSF-REU Site Program.  
During the
              past six years, 770 students applied to our NSF-REU Site Program.  REU wards
              
were made to 73 students (9.5%), 63 of whom (86%) were from schools other
              than the 
University of Colorado (CU).  University and State supported the 10
              CU REU students
matching funds; hence, all NSF funds during the past six years
              have gone to support REU students 
from schools other than CU.  Our REU
              participants included 35 women (48%) and 14 minorities 
(19%).  The average
              GPA of our participants during the past three years ,Nas 3.79/4.00. Our REU
              
students have co-authored 12 published papers (10 peer-review) and 13
              presented papers.  An 
aggressive effort by the Co-Directors resulted in a 96%
              response rate (25 out of 26 possible) to a 
follow-up survey taken at the end
              of the academic year following the students' participation in our 
1996 and
              1997 REU Site Programs.  This survey indicated that 16 of these respondees went
              on to 
graduate school (2 are still completing BS degrees).  The evaluation
              taken at the end of our 1998 
ten-week summer program indicated that it
              excited interest in graduate studies by all 14 participants.  
We seek to
              continue this very successful program for three more years.  Our proposed REU
              Site Program involves participation by 81% (13 out of 16) of our faculty in
              Chemical Engineering.  It 
includes the following enhancements and novel
              features: (1) expansion from 11 to 15 REU students; 
(2) an REU Student
              Posters Competition to encourage students to present their REU research 
at
              subsequent technical meetings; (3) provision to pay travel expenses for REU
              students to present a 
paper on their research at a technical meeting; (4) an
              enhanced recruiting program for women and 
minorities that utilizes links to
              appropriate web sites (identified in this proposal); (5) a seminar 
program
              that focuses on preparing students to do research; (6) a meaningful program of
              social and 
cultural activities that is designed to complement the research
              activities; and (7) an effective program 
evaluation form and highly
              successful follow-up survey to gauge the effectiveness of this program.  The
              University and State of Colorado (through our CSTF Center) are supporting this
              proposal with 
a total matching commitment of $126,640 amounting to 44% of the
              funds being requested from 
NSF; this includes a real-money (cash)
              contribution of $70,222.
