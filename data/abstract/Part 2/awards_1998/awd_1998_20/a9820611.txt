This research is directed towards a further understanding
              of average complexity of NP-complete problems.  NP-complete problems are
              generally thought of as being computationally intractable.  But NP-completeness
              is a worst-case concept; some NP-complete problems are easy on average, though
              some may not be.  Levin introduced the notion of  NP-completeness and used it
              to distinguish intrinsically hard-on-average problems.  A small number of
              problems have since been shown to be NP-complete on average, but this situation
              is far from satisfactory.  Finding new average complete problems remains a main
              issue in average complexity theory.  The project is aimed at a systematic
              investigation of the average complexity of concrete problems.  The goal here is
              to obtain a new list of average NP-complete problems and develop new techniques
              for proving average completeness results.
