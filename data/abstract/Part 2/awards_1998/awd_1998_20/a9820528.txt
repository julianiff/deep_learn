Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. John J. Stezowski and Jean B.
              Smith in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
              The twelve participants, recruited nationally, will take part in a program
              having the goal of enhancement of scientific independence and self-confidence
              through personal achievement in hands-on laboratory experiences.  The
              undergraduates will be offered a choice from nineteen research projects which
              include organic, physical, analytical, biochemical, inorganic and chemical
              education topics.  Presentations to other undergraduates and faculty members
              will provide a challenging yet non-threatening environment for professional
              growth and the culminating event of the summer will be a poster session before
              the entire department.
