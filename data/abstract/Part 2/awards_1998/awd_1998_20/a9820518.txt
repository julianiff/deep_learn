The University of Florida will establish a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in its Physics department with a
              focus on condensed matter physics, both theory and experiment. Twelve
              undergraduate students will be recruited nationwide for a ten-week summer
              research experience. Efforts to recruit members from groups under-represented
              in the sciences will be assisted by the Office of Minority Affairs and the
              Center for Women's Studies at the University of Florida.

Undergraduate
              students will be involved in physics research that includes a variety of topics
              in condensed matter physics and accelerator physics.  In addition, REU
              participants will attend weekly seminars, a workshop on communication skills,
              field trips to research facilities and social activities.
