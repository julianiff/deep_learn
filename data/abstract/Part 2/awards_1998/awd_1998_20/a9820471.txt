Special Project:  Travel Support for the CRA-W FCRC
              ``Super-Mentoring" Workshop:  Atlanta GA 
This grant aims at sponsoring
              ``super-mentoring'' workshop for FCRC 
'99 which expands the previous
              (primarily junior and academic) 
mentoring workshop target audience to include
              women involved in 
research careers at national laboratories and within the
              industrial 
sector, as well as senior (post-tenure) women who may be beginning
              to 
deal with impediments to further promotion.  The requested support is
              
for travel grants for participants and speakers, and support for the
              
primary workshop social event.  Past experience has shown that the 
travel
              grants are critical for many women who could not have attended 
otherwise. 
              Based on the comments from women who have attended similar 
workshops
              organized by the  Computing Research Association in the 
past, it is expected
              that this workshop will serve as a catalyst for 
positive and important
              changes in participant's lives.
