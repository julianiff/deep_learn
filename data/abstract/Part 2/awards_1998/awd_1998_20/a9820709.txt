Analysis, Synthesis and Control for General Parallel Robotic
              Systems

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.
              Parallel mechanisms offer superior rigidity and load to weight ratio than their
              serial counterparts.  When properly designed, they can even achieve relatively
              large work space.  Some robot and machine designs have taken advantage of this
              fact, for example, Gough/Stewart Platform, truss robot, hexapod machining
              center, etc.  The goal of this research is to develop a systematic approach to
              the analysis, synthesis, and control for general parallel robotic systems
              through the recently developed velocity and force manipulability
              characterization and metric on manipulability ellipsoids. Particular focus of
              this research is on the systematic modification of parallel robots and its
              manipulability through the addition of
actuators and/or kinematic constraints.
              Quantitative measures of compatibility between specified tasks and robot
              configurations will be developed based on velocity and force manipulability
              ellipsoids. These performance metrics will be used to guide the design
              of
mechanism modification.  An important issue that will be addressed in this
              research is the translation of the robot task specification to desired
              manipulability ellipsoid and appropriate ellipsoid metric.  As simulation and
              experimental examples, this research will draw on multiple cooperative
              manipulators, truss type of parallel mechanisms,
and a new parallel machining
              center developed by the Seoul National University.
