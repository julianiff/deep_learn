Abstract    :
              This is an eight week Summer Undergraduate Research program at SUNY College at
              Potsdam, NY for six students, and three student leaders.   A distinct aspect is
              that two major institutions are involved (SUNY Potsdam and Clarkson
              University).

Participant students will involve in research in the areas of
              Group theory, Graph Theory, and Topology.

The goal of this program will be
              to build the participants' confidence in their ability to do research
              independently and to stimulate their interest in pursuing mathematics.  To
              expand the students' horizons, there will be one talk each week by a guest
              expert.
