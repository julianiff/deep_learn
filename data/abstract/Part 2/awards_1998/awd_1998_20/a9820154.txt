This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks will provide
              equipment in support of oceanographic research on R/V Alpha Helix, a research
              vessel operated by the university's Seward Marine Center as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              equipment to be acquired includes a rigid-hull inflatable boat, two outboard
              motors, data acquisition software, an uninterruptable power supply, a computer,
              an under-crane winch and a rescue swimmer drysuit. The shared-use equipment
              supported here will enhance shipboard safety and assist marine scientists
              conduct studies from R/V Alpha Helix, particularly in  the Northeast Pacific
              Ocean and Bering Sea, during 1999 and future years.
