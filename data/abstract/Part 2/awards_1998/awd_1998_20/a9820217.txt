A program for research
              experiences for undergraduates in mechanical engineering at the University of
              Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is proposed.  The program offers a choice of a broad
              range of technical research topics to 12 students each year to be performed
              over a 9 week period in the summer.  In addition to the research experience, a
              component related to engineering ethics is included for the students during two
              hours each week.  Students in either their junior or senior years will be
              selected from a solicitation that will be advertised by direct mailing to
              schools, as well as other modes to attract students (such as information at
              miniority engineering and SWE conferences).  The students are selected for the
              program based upon an expression of interest, academic achievement,
              qualifications to attend graduate school, and ability to match the student's
              technical interest with faculty expertise.
