1999 Language Engineering
              Workshop for Students and Professionals: Integrating Research and Education

	This is a one-year standard award. Automated systems that interact
              with human users in spoken and written communication will greatly enhance
              productivity and program usability.  These systems will allow friendly access
              to information services and are essential for people with disabilities, or for
              accessing databases while performing intricate tasks.  Unfortunately, current
              technology is inadequate for the tasks at hand, and there is a need to make
              progress.  The numbers of available personnel trained in the field must be
              vastly increased and solutions to long standing problems must be found.  At
              this time, relatively few universities educate students capable of performing
              the required tasks.  Leading professionals are scattered in various industrial,
              adademic, and governmental institutions, often duplicating each other's work. 
              A six-week workshop on language engineering will be conducted in which mixed
              teams of leanding professionals and students would fully cooperate to advance
              the state of the art.  The professionals would normally be university
              professors and industrial and government researchers working in widely
              dispersed locations.  Graduate and undergraduate students will join these
              teams.  The participation of undergraduate students is intended not only as an
              educational opportunity but also to broaden the appeal of the language
              engineering field amongst students considering graduate studies.
