Abstract    :
              An International Workshop on Seismic Isolation, Energy Dissipation, and Control
              is being organized as part of the US-China Cooperative Earthquake Studies,
              Annex III on May 18-20, 1999, in Guangzhou, China.  This workshop will bring
              together researchers from the areas of base-isolation, passive energy
              dissipation and control, three of the most important and promising technologies
              for development of the next generation of seismically resistant structures. 
              The unique feature of this workshop is that the focus will be on the
              integration of these technologies to produce the most cost effective and
              versatile seismic protective systems.  There is a considerable amount of new
              construction as well as retrofitting of existing structures throughout China,
              and the Chinese Ministry of Construction has been quick to embrace the
              implementation of new technologies that will enhance the performance and/or
              safety of its infrastructure.  Holding the Workshop in Guangzhou will allow
              researchers to personally examine and discuss these implementations with the
              Chinese engineers and researchers.  Travel of approximately 10 researchers from
              the United States to participate in this workshop will be supported under this
              project.

This is US-PRC Earthquake Protocol, Annex III activity.
