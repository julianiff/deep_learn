Abstract    :
              The research deals with basic computational problems for groups. A central theme
              involves graph-isomorphism testing and related issues.  Polynomial-time results
              as well as other complexity theoretic issues are being extended to matrix
              groups, the common domain for applications in the mathematical sciences. 
              Implementation and experimentation is accompanying the theory, and both the
              permutation-group and new matrix-group methods are being efficiently
              implemented so that the guaranteed asymptotic timings are retained.  The same
              group-theoretic problems are relevant to a new approach to
              constraint-satisfaction problems that exploits symmetries and can augment
              existing applied systems.
