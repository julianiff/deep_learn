The proposed research is a GOALI industry-university
              collaborative project
between MIT and EPRI for the continued analytical,
              computational, and
experimental study using optical tomography measurements of
              high voltage
insulation, conduction, prebreakdown and breakdown
              characteristics in
dielectrics.  The methodology uses electric field induced
              birefringence
(Kerr effect) with an improved sensitive optical measurement
              system and a
new advanced mathematical formulation that allows calculation of
              electric
field  magnitude and direction in any electrode geometry from
              optical
intensity measurements.  Because the physics of high voltage
              charge
injection and transport, prebreakdown and electrical breakdown are not
              known
for most metal/dielectric systems, the electric field distribution
              cannot be
calculated from knowledge of system geometries alone.  Optical
              measurements
provide a direct approach to determining electrical constitutive
              laws and
learning the physics of the electrical breakdown process and so
              offers a
research methodology for major advances in increasing the breakdown
              strength
of dielectric systems. 

The proposed continuing research program
              involves both graduate and
undergraduate students together with EPRI personnel
              to try to further
understand charge injection, conduction, aging, degradation,
              prebreakdown
and breakdown mechanisms in high field stressed gaseous, liquid,
              and solid
dielectrics using new modern optical, electronic, and
              computer
instrumentation to give "eyes" inside materials to see prebreakdown
              and
breakdown field and charge distributions that could not be measured
              before.
Specific proposed work tasks are 1) Extend and complete the
              mathematical
formulation of the Kerr effect where the applied electric field
              magnitude
and direction change along the light path for any three
              dimensional
geometry; develop computational algorithms to convert measured
              optical
signals to electric field distributions; and to verify analysis
              with
experiments; 2) Develop a computer interfaced camera system with an
              optical
array detector distributed over an area to automate sensitive
              Kerr
measurement data acquisition and processing without mechanical motion;
              3)
Perform sensitive Kerr electro-optic field and charge mapping
              measurements
in a well controlled and monitored test cell for various
              liquid/solid
material combinations in the volume and within the electrical
              double layer
near interfaces as a function of DC voltage amplitude and
              polarity, AC
voltage amplitude and frequency, direction of interface with
              respect to
applied electric field, temperature, moisture, conductivity,
              and
concentration of moisture and trace additives; 4) Extend the sensitive
              Kerr
effect technique and perform measurements for weakly
              birefringent
dielectrics in pulsed, ramped, and other time varying applied
              electric
fields; 5) Relate the results of the modelling, optical measurements,
              and
dielectrometry measurements to a better understanding of high
              voltage
conduction, prebreakdown and breakdown phenomena in dielectrics in
              order to
reliably extend the operation of high voltage apparatus to higher
              voltages;
and 6) Construct a compact optical sensor measurement system that
              with the
help of EPRI personnel and contractors will be applied to electric
              field and
space charge measurements in an operating
              transformer.
