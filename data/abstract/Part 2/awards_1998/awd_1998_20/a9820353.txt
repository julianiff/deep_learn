Abstract    :
              CONVEX POLYGONAL FINITE MACROELEMENTS                                           
                                                                          Abstract           
                                                                                             
                                                                                      The
              proposal aims at developing finite macroelements without any restriction on the
              number of boundary vertices.  To achieve the highest possible accuracy, the
              research quantities the spatial rate of change in shape and size with minimal
              discretization.  Computer algebra programs will construct shape functions for
              two-dimensional convex polygons.  Analytical differentiation of the rational
              polynomial Pade interpolants will yield large strain tensors.  Closed form
              integration will lead to mass and stiffness natrices.  Morphometric computation
              with denominator polynomials of fifty two degrees yielded encouraging numerical
              results.  The macroelement growth model of the neuro-skull neighboring the
              olfactory region will be examined vis a vis the functional matrix theory of
              anatomy.  Ready contour plots of growth distribution will be generated from
              clinically observed boundary profiles of biological objects e.., skulls,
              brains, hearts and eyes, for medical diagnosis.
