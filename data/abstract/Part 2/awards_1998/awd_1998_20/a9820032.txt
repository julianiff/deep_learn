Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Darrell J. Woodman in the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Washington.  The ten participants, recruited
              to a great degree from smaller schools in the region, will take part in
              projects selected from a broad range of ongoing studies in the fields of
              analytical, bioorganic, biophysical environmental, inorganic, organic,
              organometallic, and nuclear chemistry and chemical physics.  Faculty mentors
              from the participants' home institutions will help provide joint supervision of
              the work.
