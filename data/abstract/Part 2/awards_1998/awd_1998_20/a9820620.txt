Title:
              Late Quaternary Climate of Northeast Asia: Temporal and Spatial
              Variability
This award supports a project designed to improve the
              understanding of late Quaternary climatic systems of East Asia by documenting
              spatial and temporal variations in climates of the last 18,000 radiocarbon
              years for NE Asia, describing probable millennial and centennial scale
              mechanisms that can account for the observed paleoclimatic changes, and
              comparing results from NE Asia to other regions (e.g., SE Asia, NW North
              America, North Atlantic) to obtain a more holistic view of the
              inter-relationships of regional climatic systems.  Overall research goals will
              be accomplished by: 1) reconstructing past climates through the collection and
              analysis of modern and ancient botanical, geochemical, and diatom data
              preserved in lake sediments; 2) developing high quality chronologies using
              improved radiocarbon techniques; 3) examining modern synoptic climatic
              patterns, general circulation model simulations, and conceptual frameworks to
              identify possible causes of climatic change; 4) comparing the proxy- and
              model-based paleoclimatic interpretations to assess the most likely mechanisms
              behind the observed climatic histories; and 5) exploring possible hemispheric
              scale linkages associated with Milankovitch and subMilankovitch scale event.
