Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Dee Ann Casteel in the Department of
              Chemistry at Bucknell University.   The twelve participants, recruited
              primarily from regional institutions and Bucknell, will take part in research
              projects from areas including organic  and inorganic synthesis, x-ray
              crystallography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, capillary
              electrophoresis, enzyme purification and characterization, spectroscopy and
              semi-empirical calculations.  The goals of the site are to further the chemical
              education of undergraduate students, to develop and improve their laboratory
              and analytical skills, to introduce them to the chemical literature, to give
              them experience in presenting and listening to chemical presentations, to
              promote collegiality and cooperation in a laboratory environment, to make them
              aware of career opportunities in chemistry and to nurture excitement for the
              research enterprise.
