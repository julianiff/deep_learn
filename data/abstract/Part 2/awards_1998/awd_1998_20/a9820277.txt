Abstract    :
              The Marine Sciences Research Center, SUNY Stony Brook will serve as a site for
              summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates providing opportunities for 8
              upper division undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, biology, geology,
              physics, atmospheric science, or engineering. Summer fellows will conduct
              individual research under the guidance of a faculty mentor and participate in a
              coordinated group project to study marine/estuarine processes associated with
              the development of water column and seabed hypoxia in Long Island Sound. Our
              program will provide considerable 'hands-on' experience in the field with small
              boats and sampling gear, and in the laboratory with basic analytical
              instruments. It will demonstrate the importance of teamwork in gathering and
              sharing data, and will illustrate the usefulness of scientific research for
              understanding real-world problems. Informal weekly sessions will feature guest
              speakers and discussions of ethical and social issues associated with being a
              research scientist, an environmentalist, resource manager, or government
              official. Additionally, many social activities including field trips and sports
              events will take place throughout the summer at MSRC and on campus with other
              undergraduates engaged in research programs.
