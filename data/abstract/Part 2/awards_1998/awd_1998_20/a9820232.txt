Abstract:
In the early 1990's
              the PI's developed an Ocean Bottom Absolute Gravity Meter (OBAGM) with funding
              from the Oceanographic Instrumentation Development program (proposal
              #89-20058).  This system was then deployed on the Juan de Fuca ridge in 1994,
              1995 and 1996. The PI's emplaced several seafloor benchmarks across the ridge
              and made gravity measurements on three of them (MG&G proposal #94-16939).  This
              program was the initiation of a long-term monitoring program that will attempt
              to define cm-scale vertical deformation of the ridge. 

During deployment of
              the sensors, and in subsequent land tests, the PI's have discovered a
              systematic error on the order of 1 mGal. If the instrument is operated outside
              of its pressure case, the measurements agree well with other land-based
              absolute gravity meters, indicating that the error source is vibrational
              coupling between the mechanical and optical components of the sensor. Although
              the PI's were able to correct for this systematic error, they propose here to
              redesign the system to eliminate the error, enabling the system to detect
              height changes of a few centimeters.
