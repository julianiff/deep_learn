Abstract    :
              This research project explores the factors responsible for the conformations of
              biomolecules with particular emphasis on arene-arene interactions in nucleic
              acids.   A related area of inquiry involves the synthesis and characterization
              of "foldamers," which are structurally analogous to proteins and nucleic acids.
               It is hoped that a better understanding of the relationship between specific
              structural features and overall conformation will lead to advances in
              bioorganic and medicinal chemistry and materials science.

With this award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of
              Professor Samuel H. Gellman of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. 
              Professor Gellman seeks a better understanding of how specific structural
              features of biomolecules (such molecules as proteins, enzymes, and DNA)
              interact to provide their unique and essential shapes.  Potential applications
              in the areas of medicinal chemistry and materials science could result from the
              insight provided by Professor Gellman's research team.
