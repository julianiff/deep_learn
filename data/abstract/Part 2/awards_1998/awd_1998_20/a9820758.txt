The Gordon Conference on Magnesium has met six times at
              three-year intervals since 1978.  Although more is known about the role of
              magnesium in biochemical and physiological processes, there are still serious
              gaps in our understanding of magnesium physiology.  There is paucity of
              information about a magnesium channel, magnesium homeostasis, and the possible
              existence of a magnesium hormone.  Funds are requested to invite twelve young
              investigators who are new to the Gordon Conference on Magnesium.
