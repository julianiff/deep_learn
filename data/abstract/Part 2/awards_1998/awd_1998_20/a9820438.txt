Abstract    :
              With one exception, every year since 1997 the principal investigator has
              directed a summer undergraduate research programs in discrete mathematics at
              the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The program has an extraordinary record of
              attracting the nation's top talent and producing professional
level research.
              
 
Over the years a tradition has evolved whereby former program participants
              who are in graduate school or have obtained a Ph.D. have returned for lengthy
              visits to assist with the program. The visitors take part in all
aspects of
              the program and serve as live-in councilors and role models for the
              undergraduates.  The visitors have proved to be an important component in the
              success of the program. This grant provides support to 
continue this vital
              aspect of the program.
