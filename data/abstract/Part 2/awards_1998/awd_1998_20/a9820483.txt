Abstract    :
              This action will provide further support for the REU Site in the Physics
              Department of Oregon State University.  Eight students will be selected through
              a national recruitment process to be involved in a nine-week summer research
              program in physics.  Fields of physics to be emphasized include AMO,
              computational, solid state, and nuclear.  Students will be housed together in
              campus dormitories.  Each REU student will work in a close mentoring
              relationship with one of the faculty in their research labs.  In addition to
              the research experience, the participants will complete a special short summer
              course in interfacing computers to laboratory devices, a skill that is
              essential in many research programs, and they will also receive instruction in
              machine-shop techniques.  A final "mini-conference" will give the students an
              opportunity to describe their research to their colleagues and to the faculty
              and students of the Physics Department.  The program will be evaluated through
              written surveys as well as through oral interviews.
