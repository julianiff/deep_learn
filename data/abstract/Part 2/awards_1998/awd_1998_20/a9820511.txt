One of the largest known carbon isotope excursions in the
              Phanerozoic (up to +5% shift in (18C values) has been recently documented in
              early Late Cambrian marine carbonates in Australia, China, Kazakhstan and North
              America. and has been defined the SPICE event.  In strong contrast to most
              coupled positive carbon isotope excursions and faunal crises documented in the
              Phanerozoic rock record, initiation of the SPICE event is interpreted to be
              synchronous with mass extinction of marine invertebrates rather than postdate
              the initiation of the carbon isotope excursion.  This inferred causal
              relationship suggests that mass extinction was associated with the cause of the
              major change in carbon cycling.  As a consequence of the PI's NSF-supported
              collaborative research with Drs. David Osleger and Jay Banner on integrated
              sequence stratigraphic and Sr isotope analysis of Middle to early Late Cambrian
              carbonates of North America, we have identified the basal portion of the SPICE
              event in several sections from the southern Great Basin and southern Canadian
              Rockies suggesting that the SPICE event has great potential as a
              chronostratigraphic tool of unprecedented resolution for global correlation. 
              Significantly, however, the results of our study (1) define a relationship
              between inferred sea-level changes, marine 87Sr/86Sr and (18C values, and the
              trilobite extinction that differs significantly from that proposed by the
              discoverers of the SPICE event, and (2) implies that the Processes that
              produced the trilobite mass extinction.  Additionally, our preliminary data
              suggest that a positive isotope excursion of similar magnitude to SPICE may be
              recorded in latest Lower Cambrian to early Middle Cambrian carbonates, and that
              this isotope excursion exhibits a relationship with marine 87Sr/86Sr values,
              sea-level and possibly an earlier biomere boundary that is similar to that
              defined by our study for the early SPICE event.

These initial observations,
              which are a direct outgrowth of the PI's currently NSF-funded research
              (EAR-9628382), indicate that a complex relationship exists between Cambrian
              biologic, chemical and physical phenomena, and lead to three research
              objectives: (1) to more fully address the nature of the temporal relationship
              between the SPICE event, the trilobite mass extinction, sea-level fluctuations,
              and inferred changes in seawater 87Sr/86Sr values during the late Middle to
              early Late Cambrian, (2) to test to what degree a positive carbon isotope
              excursion occurs in the latest Early Cambrian to early Middle Cambrian within a
              stratigraphic interval that records a similar magnitude sea-level fall to that
              associated with peak SPICE values and contains a biomere boundary at its base,
              and (3) to use different geochemical proxies to establish phase relationships
              and relative magnitude of physical, biologic and chemical 'events' relative to
              each other, as well as to critically evaluate and constrain the potential
              biogeochemical processes that could have linked these Cambrian physical,
              biologic and chemical phenomena.  These objectives will be addressed by
              studying four localities in the southern Great Basin and two localities in the
              southern Canadian Rockies from which much of the preliminary data come, and for
              which the greatest amount of biostratigraphic control is available.  The
              stratigraphic distribution of coupled stable ((13Ccarb and (13Corg) and
              radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr) isotope data will be coupled with trace element data in
              order to best accomplish the research objectives.  This study should contribute
              significantly towards better constraining the nature of the biogeochemical
              processes linking Cambrian biologic, physical and chemical phenomena, as well
              as further developing the potential of Cambrian positive isotope excursion
              events as high-resolution chronostratigraphic tools for global correlation and
              for locating major subdivisions of the Cambrian Systems.

The proposed
              project contributes to the fulfillment of the PI's research, teaching and
              professional goals by providing her with additional 'hands-on' experience in
              unraveling complex paleoenvironmental records, and providing research
              experience and mentoring to promising women and/or minority undergraduate
              students.  The proposed research incorporates several summer internships
              through potential cost-sharing with a DuPont Minority Educational Award;
              internships will be offered to promising women and/or minority undergraduates
              who will be recruited by the PI from geology programs throughout North
              America.
