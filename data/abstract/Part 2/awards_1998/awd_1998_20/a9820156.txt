Title: Quaternary Paleoclimatic Record from Tropical South America:
              Drilling the Salar de Uyuni

This award supports a project to drill the Salar
              de Uyuni in order to recover a 300-meter long core, representing a history of
              about 0.5Myr.  The core will be analyzed using a multi-proxy approach to
              reconstruct a climatological (effective moisture and temperature) time series
              of the Altiplano.  Dating will be done by 14C, Ar/Ar, and U/Th methods. 
              Detailed studies of the sedimentology, fluid inclusion petrography, stable
              isotopic and elemental geochemistry, and paleobiota (diatoms) will form the
              basis for the climatological reconstruction.  The following majors questions
              will be addressed:  (1) What was the nature of late Pleistocene climate
              variability in tropical South America ?  (2) Was tropical South America wet or
              dry during glacial stages?  (3) Are terrestrial tropical climate changes
              consistent with Milankovitch forcing and are they synchronous with high
              latitude changes?  What climatic mechanisms (e.g. changes in the concentration
              of atmospheric water vapor) are responsible for these changes?  (4) What are
              the dominant frequencies of suborbital-scale climatic changes in the tropics
              and are these variations in the terrestrial tropics synchronous with those at
              higher latitudes?  What climatic mechanisms are responsible for these
              paleoclimatic characteristics?
