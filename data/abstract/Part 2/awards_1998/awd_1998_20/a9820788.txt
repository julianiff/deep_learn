Abstract    :
                   A method for increasing the rate of slag-metal reactions during iron and
              steel manufacture on an industrial scale, will be demonstrated.  The method
              involves creating an external electronically conducting circuit and applying an
              electric field across the slag layer to increase the current through the
              external circuit.  This technique has been demonstrated on a lab-scale for the
              reaction between iron oxide in slag and carbon in liquid iron, and the reaction
              rate was increased by over 100%, even at low concentrations of iron oxide in
              the slag. The method will be tested on other oxides that are relevant to the
              stainless steel producers, such as Cr2O3 and MnO.  Since scale-up of the
              process is an important goal, a comprehensive mathematical model will be
              developed employing software for fluid flow and chemical thermodynamics. This
              will yield a prediction of fluid velocity, temperature, and composition as a
              function of position and time in the slag phase.  The lab and mathematical
              modeling results obtained during this program, along with earlier results
              obtained on iron oxide reduction, will be used to conduct larger-scale tests.
              
     Success of this technology will maximize metallic yield, limit or
              decrease coke (reductant) requirements, decrease refining time and consumption
              of refining agents, improve yield of alloying elements and minimize waste
              generation.  In essence, it will lead to significant energy and cost savings
              along with environmental benefits for the iron and steel producers.  An
              economic benefit analysis of industrial implementation will be performed.
