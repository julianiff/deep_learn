This U.S.-Czech engineering research project between Thomas
              Lipo of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Miroslav Chomat of the Czech
              Institute of Electrical Engineering, Prague, features development of a
              theoretical basis for the analysis, modeling, and control of variable-speed
              drives that employ advanced types of low cost, highly efficient electric
              machines.  The researchers intend to derive detailed mathematical models
              suitable for simulating both transient and steady state operations for such
              drives.  Their models in turn will permit analysis of electromagnetic processes
              taking place in the machines under various operating conditions.

Results
              should shed light on the dynamic behavior of the drives and improve our
              understanding of spatial distribution of the magnetic field in electric
              machines, including the influence of magnetic saturation, iron losses, and
              higher space harmonics.  Experimental investigations are also planned to verify
              the mathematical models and optimize the control algorithms used.  Basic
              findings may yield new circuit and control concepts for reduced cost variable
              speed drives with significant potential for application in low cost air
              conditioning drives.

This electrical engineering research project fulfills
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in
              the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
