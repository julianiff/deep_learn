Abstract    :
              This research project carried out by Professor R. Madix of Stanford University,
              and supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the
              effects of the two dimensional organization of reactive adsorbed layers on
              their reactivity.  Scanning tunneling microscopy, coupled with vibrational
              spectroscopic methods, is used to investigate the connection between
              organization in reacting overlayers, and the detailed kinetics and selectivity
              of the surface catalyzed reaction.  The spatial distribution of reactants and
              reaction intermediates, and the evolution of this distribution in time, is
              correlated with  the detailed macroscopic kinetics of the surface reaction. 
              Methanol oxidation on the Cu(110) and on the Ag(110) surface serves as the
              focus of this work.  Autocatalytic decomposition of formate species on the
              nickel surface is also examined.

A detailed understanding of the
              relationship between the organization of reactant species on surfaces and the
              observed kinetics of surface reactions is the focus of this research project. 
              An understanding of the connection between reactant ordering and kinetics
              promises insights into the function of catalytic materials, and the selectivity
              of their operation.  This information is fundamental to the understanding of a
              number of important heterogenous catalytic processes,  with significant
              industrial application.
