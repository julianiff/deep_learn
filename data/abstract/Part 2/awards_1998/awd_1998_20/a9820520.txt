Abstract    :
              This project is intended to give undergraduate students an opportunity to be
              involved in mathematics research.  It is especially intended to give this
              chance to students who may not have sufficient resources at their home
              institution.  For this reason, applications are encouraged from students at
              schools without graduate programs or any school where undergraduate research
              opportunities are not available.  To encourage participation by members of
              groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, applications are
              solicited from women, minorities and those with disabilities.

The general
              area of research will be discrete mathematics ranging from finite groups, and
              Ramsey theory to optimization and combinatorial geometry.  Each of the listed
              disciplines has a large number of problems suitable for undergraduate research.
               Students are anticipated to choose their favorite problems and work
              individually or in small groups on one or more of the problems.

The program
              will emphasize the development of research skills and the reading of scientific
              literature.  In addition, the students are expected to develop their
              communication skills, in particular, how to write up their anticipated results
              and how to communicate them orally to others.
