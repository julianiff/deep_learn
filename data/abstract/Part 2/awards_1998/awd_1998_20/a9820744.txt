Abstract    :
                   Mathematical models of complex systems, in particular those arising in
              engineering applications, offer an opportunity to optimize their design and
              operation.  This can be accomplished through the selection of an objective
              function and decision variables that mathematically optimize system
              performance.  Many local search algorithms exist which can find a local optimum
              for such models, but effective global search algorithms that promise to find a
              global optimum are just beginning to become available.  These global
              optimization algorithms are compromised however by an inability to be scaled up
              to solve practical large scale optimization problems.  It is particularly
              important therefore that new algorithms be developed with a rigorous
              theoretical foundation that makes reliable predictions about their performance
              as a function of the size or scale of the problems to be solved.
     The
              overall objective of this proposed research is to improve the effectiveness of
              global optimization methods by establishing a theoretical foundation for a
              class of stochastic search methods.  The conceptual
framework proposed is that
              of solving global optimization problems by stochastic emulation of
              distributions that concentrate around the global optimum.  Development of rapid
              sampling algorithms can thereby lead to
efficient global optimization
              algorithms. These algorithms will be tested on three application areas:  (1)
              structural optimization; (2) shape optimization;  and (3) equipment replacement
              under technological change. The approach promises to lead to an efficient
              algorithm that will render tractable problems like our three application
              areas.
