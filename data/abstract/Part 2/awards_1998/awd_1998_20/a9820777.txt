Abstract    :
              Phenomena occurring at the interface between a flowing liquid-solid particle
              mixture of high solid volume fraction (0.3 to 0.55) and an adjacent immiscible
              fluid will be experimentally and computationally investigated.  The effects of
              particle migration towards the interface and the shape of the interfacial
              surface will be studied.  The experiments will be performed with noncolloidal
              suspensions of spheres of same density and same optic index as the carrier
              fluid.  Imaging and laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV) will provide information on
              the flow microstructure, mean velocity and interface between the two-phase and
              immiscible fluid.  Gravity-driven suspension flow and the free surface between
              concentric rotating cylinders are considered for illustrations.  The proposed
              research project has relevance to suspension films, coatings, extrusion, mixing
              and reaction processes.
