This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will
              provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Pelican, a
              research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be acquired
              includes a salinometer for shipboard use, several water sampling bottles, a
              transmissometer and light sensor. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Gulf of
              Mexico, in 1999 and future years.
