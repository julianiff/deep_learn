Decades of research failed to demystify the power of the
              two basic "freedoms" stretching the concept of deterministic computation: 
              randomness and non-determinism.  In recent years, however, some vague pattern
              is emerging in relationships between them.  Even more notable seems the pattern
              of techniques instrumental for quite different results in this area:
              multilinear and low-degree multivariate polynomials, Fourier transformation
              over low-periodic groups, related to classical results on error-correcting
              codes or hashing.  Some techniques based on different math, like expander
              graphs, also emerge as very relevant. 

This project continues investigation
              of the power of randomness and non-determinism using the above or similar
              techniques.  

Several specific directions of the research are:

The
              concept and specific examples of average-case (rather than worst case)
              intractability of NP-problems and problems of inverting one-way functions;
              removing degeneracy of one-way functions as an obstacle to efficient generation
              of pseudo-random bits. 

Improvement and simplification of fault-resistant
              computation and communication.
