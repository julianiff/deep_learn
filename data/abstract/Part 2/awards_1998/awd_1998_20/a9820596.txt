This award is for support of a two-day workshop focused on Lake
              Vostok, a large subglacial lake in East Antarctica.  The goal of the workshop
              will be to stimulate discussion within the U.S. science community and to gauge
              interest for future research on Lake Vostok.  The workshop will attempt to
              develop an interdisciplinary science plan for studies of the lake.  The
              workshop will be held in early November and will bring together scientists from
              the fields of biology, biochemistry, geology and geophysics, glaciology and sea
              ice studies, among others.  The workshop will produce a list of recommendations
              for further studies on Lake Vostok.
