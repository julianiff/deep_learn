Abstract    :
              This award supports the use of agent-based models to study the emergence of
              multi-agent institutions in society and to test these models against data. The
              computational approach taken here departs from perfectly rational models in
              favor of boundedly rational models and non-equilibrium dynamics. The models are
              inherently concerned with social interactions and the ways in which
              institutions (and social norms and conformity effects) emerge out of those
              interactions. Five models will be developed including: the Long House Valley
              Anasazi from 800 AD to their disappearance in 1300 AD; crime rates; retirement
              decision-making; the distribution of firm sizes; and institutions of
              governance.  These models will advance scientific knowledge about multi-agent
              systems, simulation and anthropology as well as contribute to policy-making
              about criminal, retirement and organizational behaviors.
