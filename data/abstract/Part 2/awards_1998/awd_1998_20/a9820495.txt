Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Division
              of Biological Infrastructure, and Office Of Multidisciplinary Activities will
              provide support to Jean H. Futrell of the University of Delaware for a workshop
              on advanced instrumentation.  This workshop will seek (i) to define the needs
              for advanced analytical instrumentation that will enable  the United States to
              remain in the forefront of emerging science and technology into the next
              century, and (ii) to outline a path forward which will enable the development
              of these instruments.  Leaders from the scientific community who represent the
              chemical, molecular biology and materials science disciplines, innovators from
              academic, industrial and national laboratories, instrument manufacturers and
              entrepreneurs will participate.  Priorities for the development of new
              instrumentation will be established, and research and development issues
              necessary to enable their development will be identified.
