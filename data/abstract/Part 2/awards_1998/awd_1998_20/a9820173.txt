Abstract    :
              This grant will continue support of a REU Site located at the Los Alamos Summer
              School.  This school is a joint project of the University of New Mexico and the
              Los Alamos National Laboratory which encompasses an evolving educational
              program focused on attracting the best upper-level undergraduates into research
              careers in the physical sciences.  Special features of the School include its
              combined program of lectures, tutorials, and mentored research projects, many
              of which emphasize atomic, molecular, and optical physics in supercomputing
              applications.  Students are recruited nationally, and the representation of
              talented people of diverse backgrounds has been good.  Classes maximize
              personal interactions among the students and with the scientific staff and
              provide valuable training for young lecturers as well as students who will
              clearly be leaders of tomorrow's scientific community.
