Abstract    :
              This project will establish a collaborative research program with the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) for undergraduate students at Bridgewater
              State College (BSC). We propose to calibrate by experiment the
              empirical/theoretical models used to predict oxygen isotope fractionation
              factors between common hydrous silicates and aluminosilicates and water. The
              results of these experiments will be used to constrain the thermal history of
              serpentinization in the oceanic lithosphere through oxygen isotope analyses of
              altered ultramafic rocks dredged from slow spreading mid-ocean ridge
              environments. Through involvement in both experimental and field-based inquiry,
              students working on this project will have an opportunity to experience how two
              vastly different approaches are used to support the solution to a scientific
              problem.  The project is ideally suited for students in the interdisciplinary
              geology-chemistry program at BSC and all laboratory based research will be
              conducted at WHOI, providing students access to a unique research environment
              and extensive facilities.
