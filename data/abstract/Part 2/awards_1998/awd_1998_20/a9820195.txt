This award will support a planning visit by Dr. Eric U.
              Selker of the University of Oregon, to go to Cordoba, Argentina to meet with
              Dr. Alberto Luis Rosa at the University of Cordoba.  During this planning
              visit, they intend to develop a collaborative research proposal to address the
              question of structure and function of centromere sequences in neurospora.
