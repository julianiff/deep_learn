Dr. Narayan
              will continue his work on models of 'advection-dominated accretion flows', or
              ADAFs, as applied to the central mass concentration of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, and
              other galactic nuclei.  The model, while successful in explaining some aspects
              of galactic nuclei, requires further development to address issues of outflow
              and winds, to improve comparison to observational data, and to obtain better
              matches to the mass accretion rate in our galaxy and others.
