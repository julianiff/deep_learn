The symposium on Nanolithographic Methods for Organizing
              Materials into Functional Structures will address the organization of materials
              at the nanometer-length scale into two dimensional (2-D) and 3-D structures by
              non-traditional, non-lighographic methods of fabrication.  The symposium
              includes discussions of areas that are important to the education of the next
              generation of materials scientists and engineers who will rely on fundamental
              principles underlying the design, synthesis, and properties of increasingly
              complex materials.  This is among the first major meetings dealing with
              nontraditional approaches to the nanoscale chemistry and physics of functional
              materials structures.
%%%
Nanostructured materials often display chemical and
              physical properties distinctly different from their corresponding bulk
              materials. A host of fundamentally interesting and potentially useful
              mechanical, electrical, photonic, and catalytic materials nanostructures with
              novel properties are being discovered and developed for various
              applications.
