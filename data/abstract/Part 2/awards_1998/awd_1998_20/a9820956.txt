Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference "Controls and Significance of Carbon Fluxes in
              Polar Seas" will be held from 7-12 March, 1999, in Ventura CA.  The conference
              will provide a review, synthesis and forum for discussion of our present
              understanding of the physical, chemical and biological controls of carbon
              fluxes in polar marine regions.  In addition, the conference will explore the
              relationship between carbon cycling in polar regions to global oceanographic
              processes.  This information is useful for training new polar scientists and
              for planning research programs that pertain to polar environments and global
              change.
