Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Catherine J. Murphy in the Department
              of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina.  The ten
              participants, recruited nationally, will take part in projects chosen from
              nanoscience research focused on the synthesis of conducting polymers, the use
              of colloidal semiconductors as optical sensors in biomolecular systems, the use
              of scanning probe microscopy to selectively replace single molecules in
              assemblies, the tracing routes of energy flow in nanoclusters and theoretical
              calculations of supramolecular conformations.   Activities such as symposia and
              organized laboratory and lecture tutorials are designed to stimulate
              student-faculty and student-student interactions.
