Abstract    :
              As the nation commits more and more of its information and data resources to
              digital form, the assurance that vital records are stored and information is
              preserved for future generations is essential. The NSF Workshop on Data
              Archival and Information Preservation addressing these issues is organized by
              Christine Borgman, UCLA; Su-Shing Chen, University of Missouri-Columbia
              (Co-Chair), Hector Garcia-Molina, Stanford University; Ken Thibodeau, NARA and
              Gio Wiederhold, Stanford University (Co-Chair) and is held on March 26-27, 1999
              in Washington DC. The goal of this workshop is to provide research directions
              concerning with various aspects of data archival and information preservation.
              The objective is to converge different aspects to a visionary report for
              archivists, system developers, organizations, and technologists. Topics to be
              discussed include: Information Preservation and its Requirements; Information
              Media and Storage Media; System and Technology; Workflow, Information
              Preservation and Data Archiving Processes; and Policy and Usability. The
              material prepared for the workshop, and, at the conclusion, the final report of
              the workshop will be submitted to NSF and disseminated widely, including at the
              workshop Web sites at http://www-db.stanford.edu/LIC/preservation.html and
