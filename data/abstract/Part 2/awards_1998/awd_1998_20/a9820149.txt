The multi-institutional Materials Research Science and
              Engineering Center (MRSEC) based at Stanford University offers research
              experiences for undergraduate students through a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The MRSEC involves, in addition to Stanford, the
              University of California-Davis and IBM-Almaden Research Center.  Fifteen
              undergraduate students are recruited nationwide for a ten week summer research
              program.  Students' research projects focus on polymer interfaces and
              macromolecular assemblies.  In addition, students attend weekly seminars and
              social activities.

This REU Site, with an emphasis on recruiting
              undergraduate students from two-year and four-year institutions, provides
              research opportunities to students who might not have such opportunities at
              their home institution.  Undergraduate participants are exposed to both
              academic and industrial research environments.
