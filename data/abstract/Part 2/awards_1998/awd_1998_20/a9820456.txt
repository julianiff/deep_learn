Abstract    :
              This award supports the establishment of an REU Site at the University of South
              Carolina that focuses upon integrative research in evolutionary biology. The
              objective is to provide training opportunities for undergraduates interested in
              two or more sub-specialties of evolutionary biology with an emphasis on the
              interface between molecular genetics and organismal-level processes. The
              program will enable qualified students to undertake summer-long and/or
              academic-year independent research projects under the direction of one or more
              faculty mentors who span the range of evolutionary biology.  Students will
              learn about hypothesis generation and testing, as well as the techniques and
              experimental designs employed in molecular biology and one or more other
              subspecialty areas - including behavior, life history evolution, systematics,
              population biology, or ecological physiology.  Students will present summaries
              of their work in departmental mini-symposia. Students will be recruited
              throughout the USA, and a strong emphasis will be placed on recruitment of
              underrepresented groups from smaller undergraduate institutions (especially
              institutions with large minority representation).
