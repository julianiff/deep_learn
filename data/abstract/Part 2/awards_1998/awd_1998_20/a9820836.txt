Chemically reactive plasma discharges are widely used in the
              semiconductor and fiat panel display indus-tries for etching and deposition
              processes; moreover, their use has become critical for VLSI circuit and thin
              film transistor (TFT) production. High density rf inductively coupled plasma
              sources will play an increasing role in processing as feature sizes shrink and
              as wafer and TFT substrate sizes increase. This proposal is for continuation of
              research on such discharges. The program involves (a) experiments and
              analytical models for a large area plasma source (LAPS) that is inductively
              excited by an rf traveling wave launched onto an antenna coil embedded within
              the plasma volume, and (b) theories and experiments to examine equilibrium,
              hysteresis, and unstable behavior in inductively coupled plasma sources with
              electronegative gas feedstocks.
The LAPS has favorable properties for scaling
              to large sizes. Plasma in the source is generated in a rectangular box 71.1 cm
              x 61.0 cm x 20.3 cm containing a substrate holder large enough to study
              processing of silicon wafers as large as 300 mm in diameter and fiat panel
              glass substrate sizes as large as 360 mm x 465 mm. A critical issue to be
              examined in the experiments is whether traveling wave excitation of a coil
              embedded in the plasma can generate uniform plasmas and materials processing
              over large areas.
The studies of electronegative discharge equilibrium,
              hysteresis, and instabilities will be performed in a planar inductive discharge
              (transformer-coupled plasma, or TCP) of the conventional type used for VLSI
              processing. Feedstock gases for etch applications will be used, including
              chlorine, oxygen, SF6, and their mixtures with argon.
