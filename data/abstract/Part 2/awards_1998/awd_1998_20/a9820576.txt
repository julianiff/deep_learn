Dr. Ziurys continues her
              program of investigation of the chemistry of the metallic elements in the
              interstellar medium through a joint laboratory and observational program.  The
              observations are designed to identify the major molecular carriers of the
              metallic elements in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars and in dense
              clouds through millimeter/sub-mm observations.  The laboratory work supplies
              the spectra from which rest frequencies for the astronomical searches are
              obtained.  Studies will begin toward IRC+10216, but then will be extended to
              other stars, both in the AGB and post-AGB phase, and to molecular clouds.  Her
              goal is to construct a complete picture of metal-containing molecules, their
              abundances, formation mechanisms, and significance for understanding mass loss
              of the heavier elements from circumstellar envelopes to the interstellar
              medium.
