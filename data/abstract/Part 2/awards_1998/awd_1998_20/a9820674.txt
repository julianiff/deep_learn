The American and Australian counterparts will investigate
              the reproductive biology of endemic drosophilids in rain forests and other
              moist habitats of Australia.  The three areas of investigation are: 1)
              evolutionary ecology of reproductive effort with emphasis on the relationship
              of egg size to egg number and larval habitat; 2) studies on the correlated
              responses of rapidly evolving male and female reproductive structures that may
              be important to the process of speciation; and 3) microbial associations
              (yeasts) of the drosophilids in their natural habitats.  The Australian
              counterpart is Prof. J.S.F. Barker, Department of Animal Science, University of
              New England, Armidale, Australia.
