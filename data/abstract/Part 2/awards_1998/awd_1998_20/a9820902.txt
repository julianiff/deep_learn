Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the development of practical algorithms for
              several network design problems, including problems related to graph
              connectivity.

Another area studied is capacitated vehicle routing, which is
              closely related to the Traveling Salesman Problem.  Given a collection of
              objects distributed at different locations, the problem is to deliver the
              objects to specified locations using a vehicle of bounded capacity.  Such
              problems arise in transportation of goods and motion-planning of robots.
