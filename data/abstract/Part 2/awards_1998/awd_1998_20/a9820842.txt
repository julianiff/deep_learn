Abstract    :
              
The 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake claimed more than 5500 lives and caused
              damage in excess of 100 billion dollars.  Gas, water and electric utility lines
              ruptured.  Bridges and over-passes on highways, railroads and subways
              collapsed.  High-rise residential and office structures were severely damaged. 
              Liquefied soils settled and spread laterally along the coast and in docks,
              piers, sea walls and quays.  Kilometers of docks and quay walls tilted and
              settled both at the coast and in the man-made islands, Port Island and Rokko
              Island.  The entire port of Kobe was almost completely destroyed.  This urban
              disaster resulted from an earthquake striking directly within a densely
              populated urban area.  A similar devastation was fortunately avoided in the San
              Fernando Valley in California as the 194 Northridge earthquake released its
              energy away from populated areas.  

This award is part of a collaborative
              effort involving a team of US and Japanese researchers.  On the US side, the
              team includes professors and students from Cornell University, Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Southern California (USC). 
              Several US government and industrial organizations have also agreed to
              cooperate in the proposed work, including, the Multidisciplinary Center for
              Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER), Los Angeles Department of Water and
              Power (LADWP), Pacific Gas & Electric Company, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
              U.S. Geological Survey, and Woodward-Clyde Consultants.  On the Japanese side,
              the team consists of professors and students from Kyoto University, Tokyo
              Institute of Technology, University of Tokyo, Waseda University, and Yamaguchi
              University.  Several Japanese government and industrial organizations will also
              contribute to the research effort.  

The main objective of the proposed team
              research is to investigate the effects of liquefaction-induced deformation on
              foundations and lifelines systems in the 1994 Northridge and 1995
              Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquakes, and to propose engineering solutions that mitigate
              these devastating effects in future in earthquakes.  The findings of the
              research team will contribute to the implementation of performance-based design
              in geotechnical and structural engineering in the United States and
              Japan.

The research team at RPI is focusing on generic centrifuge models and
              interpretations of two Japanese case histories of lateral spreading:  Port 
              Island in Kobe 1995  (with appropriate near-field input excitation), and
              Niigata 1964 near the Shinano River.  The research program also includes
              centrifuge research and interpretations on lateral spreading effects on pile
              foundations, on effectiveness of soil and foundations improvement schemes, and
              on the effect of inertia forces on piles in lateral spreading soil
