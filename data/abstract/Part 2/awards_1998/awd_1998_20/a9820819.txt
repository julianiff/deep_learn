Abstract    :
              This award to the Office of International Activities of the American Chemical
              Society, represented by Michael P. Doyle, contributes to support the US -
              Taiwan Symposium on Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis.  The symposium will
              be held at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan on April 10-13,
              1999. Seven invited speakers from the United States will present papers on
              recent achievements in this research area, as will seven invited speakers from
              Taiwan. Short talks and papers from researchers in Taiwan and other countries
              in Southeast Asia will also be included.  The event is designed to increase
              collaborative research between faculty from the US and Southeast Asia.  This
              field was selected for interaction because of its history of rapid growth and
              vitality, its applications in industry, and its importance in the development
              of environmentally benign synthetic methods.
