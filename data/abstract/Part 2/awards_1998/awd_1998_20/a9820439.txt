Abstract    :
              This grant will continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the
              Department of Physics of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.  Ten physics
              majors from across the nation will participate with about 15 Michigan physics
              majors in a 10-week research experience.  A two-week shop class and radiation
              safety training are given to all student.  Weekly colloquia on diverse research
              topics and lab tours are given by Michigan faculty.  Weekly social activities
              as well as field trips to places like Fermilab are planned.  The last week is
              dedicated to the presentation of student talks summarizing their summer's
              research.
