Abstract    :
              This SGER project involves an analysis and comparison of Japanese elementary
              school teacher materials in mathematics.  The PI, Dr. Tad Watanabe of Towson
              University, will analyze the overall structure of the teacher materials in the
              content areas of number and operations, geometry, and algebra using the United
              States Department of Education's criteria for Promising and Exemplary Programs.
               The analysis involves the two most popular programs in Japan and two American
              programs, one that has been NSF-supported and another published program.  The
              proposal notes the impact of the TIMSS results and seeks to address the
              questions of teaching differences through this analysis and comparison.  The
              purpose of this investigation, however, is not to evaluate or assess Japanese
              and American teacher materials, but to report how such materials are organized
              and to determine how consistent they are with the way mathematics is taught.
