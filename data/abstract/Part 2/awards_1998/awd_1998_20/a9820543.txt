Cornell University provides opportunities for undergraduate
              research through a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site.  The REU Site is hosted by the Cornell Center for Materials
              Research (CCMR), the core of which is a Materials Research Science and
              Engineering Center (MRSEC) that encompasses research in several areas.  The
              CCMR includes over ninety faculty from nine departments; opportunities for
              student research projects are drawn from this pool, with a focus on the primary
              research areas of the MRSEC: molecular inorganic-organic composites, thin films
              on glass, energetic beam deposition and processing of thin films, and metallic
              nanostructures.  A general underlying theme of the pursuit of understanding and
              control of materials at the nanoscopic scale permeates the whole
              program.

Twenty undergraduate students will be recruited nationwide for a
              ten-week summer research experience.  In addition to working in individual
              research projects, REU participants will attend one- or two-day hands-on
              minicourses that offer an introduction to various technical aspects of
              research, weekly talks and social activities.
