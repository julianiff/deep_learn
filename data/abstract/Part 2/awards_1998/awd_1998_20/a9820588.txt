Abstract    :
              This grant will provide one year's further support of the REU Site located in
              the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) and the Physics
              Department at UC Santa Cruz.  Undergraduates from all over the country largely
              from groups under-represented in physics will be integrated into on-going
              research activities.  Students work for nine weeks full-time in the High-Energy
              Physics and Condensed Matter laboratories under the direct supervision of
              faculty and in collaboration with post-doctoral researchers, students and
              staff.  The research projects cover a wide variety of topics, from work on
              semiconductor detectors and associated ASIC's to application of polymers in
              display technology.  In weekly sessions, students report on their findings and
              discuss them with their peers.  In addition, visits to nearby research
              institutions are arranged.  The students are housed as a group on campus, to
              foster interaction of students with different backgrounds.
