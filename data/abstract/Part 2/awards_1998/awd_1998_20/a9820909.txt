Abstract    :
              9820909

Professor Shou-Wu Zhang will continues his studies in arithmetic
              geometry, with focus on the geometry of algebraic points and the arithmetic of
              modular forms.  This research is based on his previous work on the Bogomolov
              conjecture and the Gross-Zagier formula.  On the side of algebraic points,
              Zhang will study "the scatteredness of big points" on a subvariety of an
              abelian variety and "the arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer class" for arithmetic
              surfaces.  On the modular form side, Zhang will try to prove a  "Gross-Zagier
              type formula for Maass forms" and to finish his work on "the Atkin-Lehner
              theory on Shimura curves" in positive characteristic.

This research falls
              into a modern area of number theory known as arithmetic geometry in which
              geometric methods are used to solve problems in number theory.  Number theory
              has its historical roots in the study of the natural numbers.  It is among the
              oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely
              aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century it has become an
              indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing, and communication systems.
