Abstract    :
              Each summer, 10 undergraduates will be selected from a pool of 600-700
              applicants to spend three weeks learning basic molecular biology techniques in
              an intensive laboratory course. Following the course, each student will spend
              seven weeks completing an independent research project, which involves the
              application of many of the techniques, learned in the course. The research
              project is conducted under the direction of one of the more than 80 faculty
              members affiliated with the program. The mentors are basic scientists who have
              a common interest in research, which involves the use of recombinant DNA
              technology. During the ten-week period, students also will participate in
              interactive seminars which focus on responsible conduct of research and ethical
              issues in the rapidly changing research environment.  Supplemental activities
              include weekly student seminars and evening workshops designed to strengthen
              future applications for postgraduate studies.  All students will attend a
              campus-wide research conference at the end of the program where they will
              present the results of their research project through a scientific poster
              and/or a scientific paper. At least one-half of the participants will be from
              underrepresented groups women, students of color, and students with
              disabilities and will be from institutions other than the University of
              Minnesota.
