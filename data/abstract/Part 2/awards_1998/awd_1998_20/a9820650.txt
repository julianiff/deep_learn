Abstract    :
              The work that will be done under this award addresses fundamental problems in
              the physics and mathematics of many-body systems.  There will be three main
              areas: (1) the development of a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics that
              can deal properly with the bound states of atomic and condensed matter physics;
              (2) a continuation of the progress made recently to understand rigorously the
              ground states of low density Bose gases, especially the condensation
              phenomenon, which is a subject of much current experimental interest; (3) the
              study of the Hubbard model, which is now considered one of the cornerstones of
              correlated electron phenomena.  Additionally, some topics in pure mathematics
              and partial differential equations will be addressed.
