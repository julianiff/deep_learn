Abstract    :
              This project examines the religious, political, economic, and social values of
              representative national samples of the adult populations of Egypt, Iran, and
              Jordan.  Surveys will be conducted to gather data to analyze (1) the belief
              systems of contemporary Islamic publics in a global comparative context; (2) to
              better understand the processes of value formation and value change in these
              complex societies; (3) to assess rigorously and in conjunction with the
              existing comparative historical research the connection between secularization,
              on the one hand, and rational-legal authority, bureaucratization and liberal
              democracy, on the other; (4) to explore the social bases of fundamentalism, the
              relationship between religion and gender, and between religion and nationalism;
              and (5) to examine the extent of Islamic pluralism and its connection with
              competitive market forces.   This project will provide a unique empirical
              database for the analysis of social change and of change in Islamic societies. 
              The research also has the potential to have far reaching impact on social
              scientific research in the region.  It will establish a network of social
              scientists and provide them with a data set to facilitate meaningful
              comparisons between their societies, and aid in the development of theories and
              methodological skills.  The project also creates the potential for further
              collaborative research, exchange of knowledge, and the requisite organizational
              expertise on how to establish social support for research, fund raising, and
              the establishment of foundations in these societies.
