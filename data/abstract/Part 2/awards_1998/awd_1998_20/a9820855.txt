Abstract:

The intrinsic complexity of computational
              problems will be studied, with an emphasis on communication questions and
              quantum computing.  Topics to be explored include complexity theories for
              multiparty communications, probabilistic communications, quantum
              communications, quantum circuits, etc.  Other subjects to be investigated
              include various complexity questions for algebraic decision trees.  It is
              expected that techniques from combinatorics, probability theory, and topology
              will provide the main mathematical tools for this project.
