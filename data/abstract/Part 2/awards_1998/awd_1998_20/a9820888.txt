Abstract    :
              Epidemic and gossip algorithms attempt to spread information quickly through a
              network of processors.  Traditionally, these algorithms have assumed that most
              processors and communications links run at approximately the same speed.  This
              assumption is unrealistic for large Wide Area Networks such as the Internet
              that contain both slow and fast links and both slow and fast machines.  The
              project will design and analyze highly-resilient and scalable mechanisms for
              propagating information rapidly that extend the epidemic approach to models
              that more accurately reflect real-world conditions.
