This proposal
              seeks a NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in the Department of
              Construction Engineering, Materials Engineering, and Industrial Design at
              Western Michigan University.  The site will be focused on the Construction
              Engineering and Management that is a relatively new discipline that has emerged
              from the growing demands on the construction profession.  This undergraduate
              research experience is designed to provide students with an improved
              understanding of research and to encourage them to consider graduate studies
              and research in the Construction Engineering and Management area.  Components
              of the program include identification of exceptional students through
              nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and minority participation;
              matching student interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students
              and faculty with the REU participants to provide students with a fuller
              appreciation of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia;
              an intense two-month research experience; a short course in construction
              engineering and management to facilitate effectiveness in the research
              projects; an ethics workshop; an evaluation program; and a cohort of other
              related professional and social activities.

The key distinctive elements of
              our approach are: (1) to present each participant with several possible project
              topics, so that they can feel they have chosen a project which is most
              interesting to them, (2) to immerse the participants in the general research
              environment essentially as if they were graduate students, by having them meet
              with the faculty member once each week to discuss their project, participate in
              the weekly research group meetings, attend research presentations and meet with
              visiting researchers, and (3) to participate in an array of professional
              activities such as spending time on real construction projects to experience
              the dynamics of the construction environment, visiting owner organization to
              learn more about contract administration issues and processes, participate in
              an ethics workshop to learn more about professional ethical issues and
              dilemmas, and learn to assimilate the latest research from reading and
              discussing recent papers, and learn how to write up and present the results of
              their own research.
