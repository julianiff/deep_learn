Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Joseph W. Bruno in the Department of
              Chemistry at Wesleyan University.  The seven participants, recruited
              nationally, will take part in a program entitled "A Summer Research Program for
              Underrepresented Minorities."   The focus for the recruiting effort will center
              on the eleven historically black colleges and universities which sent
              representatives to the Wesleyan Conference on Recruitment of Minority
              Scientists in October of 1992.  Aside from their involvement in research
              projects involving organic, inorganic, biological and physical chemistry,
              participants will attend an orientation program, take part in a biweekly
              workshop on laboratory safety regulations and  receive training on the use of
              major research instrumentation.  Activities germane to preparation for graduate
              school include interactions with Wesleyan minority graduate students and
              participation in the NSF-sponsored Wesleyan Science Writing Program.  At the
              end of the summer the undergraduates will get the opportunity to present their
              research findings by poster and seminar presentations.
