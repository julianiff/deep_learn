Proposal Title:  Taming Vibration of Rotating
              Disk/Spindle Systems
Project Abstract:
 For the past 3 years, the disk drive
              industry has tripled the track density and doubled the rotational speed to
              increase storage capacity and to reduce data access time.  As a result, disk
              and spindle vibration becomes a critical issue and a major concern.  In
              general, rotating disk/spindle systems present two types of vibration: 
              in-plane and out-of-plane.  To suppress the in-plane vibration, the industry is
              developing precision spindles with hydrodynamic bearings.  To suppress the
              out-of-plane vibration, the industry is developing alternative disk substrates
              such as laminated disks.  Because these developments are fairly recent, the
              industry has very little fundamental understanding, and knowledge bases are
              almost nonexistent at present.
Motivated by these imminent needs, the proposed
              research is (a) to develop a mathematical model to predict vibration response
              of rotating disk/spindle systems with hydrodynamic bearings, and (b) to
              evaluate damping performance of alternative disk substrates subjected to
              high-speed spinning and rocking,  For hydrodynamic spindles, the research focus
              will be rotating-shaft design and nonlinear stiffness effects.  For alternative
              substrates, the research will address two most fundamental issues of laminated
              disks:  frequency-domain analysis and temperature effects.
Success of the
              proposed research will provide the industry with fundamental understanding and
              knowledge bases to make important breakthroughs in these areas.  Results of the
              proposed research will also be useful to other industries that employ small,
              high-speed, and precision spindle motors, such as DVD (Digital Versatile Disks)
              industry.
