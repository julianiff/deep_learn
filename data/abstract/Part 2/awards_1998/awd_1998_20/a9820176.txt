Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. William E. Kurtin  in the
              Department of Chemistry  at Trinity  University.  The ten participants will
              include at least seven students who attend institutions in the San Antonio
              metropolitan area other than Trinity.  The summer experience for the
              participants will include introductory workshops designed to teach basic
              research skills and use of modern instrumentation.  During the research period,
              they will learn how to effectively communicate results and will discuss ethical
              issues in science.  They will meet and talk with visiting seminar speakers and
              take field trips to chemical companies and research institutions.
