Drs. Mateo and
              Arabadjis will carry out an observational and theoretical research program to
              identify and characterize the detailed properties of distinct structures, or
              streams, in the galactic halo.  These streams are thought to be the remnants of
              dwarf galaxies that have been tidally disrupted through interactions with the
              Milky Way galaxy.  The observational program relies on a technique developed by
              the PI to identify and study streams at extremely low surface brightness
              levels.  They will apply this technique to further study of the nearby,
              recently discovered Sgr dwarf galaxy, and to the Magellanic Stream, as well as
              other remnant signatures that are identified in ongoing searches by the PI and
              others.  They will follow these photometric searches with velocity studies. 
              The theoretical portion of the project involves attempts to model the
              disruption of the satellite galaxies, and to produce a description of the
              large-scale distribution of tidal debris throughout the galactic halo using a
              combination of N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics techniques.
