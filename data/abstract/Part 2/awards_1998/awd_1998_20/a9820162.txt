Contaminated ground
              water imperils our water supply.  The biodegradability of hydrocarbon
              contaminants in soils is effected by sorption processes, intraparticle
              diffusion and the effects of aging and the availability of electron acceptors. 
              These processes are not fully understood.  Predictive models based on physical
              chemical and biochemical properties of both the contaminants and soils are
              needed.  This three year project brings together the New Jersey Institute of
              Technology Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
              Hazardous Waster Management and the French INSA de Lyon Center, Association
              Reseau Cooperatif de Recherche sur les Dechets (ReCoRD) to address these
              needs.

The collaborative project will study laboratory scale batch and soil
              column tests to determine the characteristic physical and biochemical
              parameters required for model development.  The model will be validated by
              field test data from sites contaminated with cool tar constituents.

The
              French will develop the microscale characterization of the surface interactions
              between pollutants and the soils.  The U.S. researchers will develops a
              mathematical predictive model and test it with laboratory and field tests.  One
              third of the U.S. component of this collaborative project will be funded by the
              I/UCRC.  The French Government will fund their component.
