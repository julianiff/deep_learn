Abstract    :
              This summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate) program will be held
              inthe year 2000 at Washington State University.  The theme will be
              environmental mathematics.  The participants will work on research problems
              that deal with environmental issues such as groundwater
              contamination/remediation and carbon cycle in the biosphere.  they will analyze
              various mathematical models in the form of coupled ordinary/partial
              differential equations that describe these environmental problems.  In their
              analyses, undergraduate-level mathematical concepts such as, isocline analysis,
              phase plane analysis, Laplace transforms, pseudo-inverses, method of separation
              of variables and singular perturbation methods will be used.  Also, software
              such as MATHEMATICA and MATLAB will be employed in carrying out the analyses. 
              For some problems, computer simulations will be performed making use of LU
              decomposition techniques and finite-difference methods.  The first two weeks
              will be devoted to teaching the participants the necessary mathematical
              concepts and familiarizing them with the on site computer resources.  By
              exposing the undergraduate participants to interesting and important "real
              world" problems, we intend to make them learn and appreciate the power and
              usefulness of mathematics in real life.  Our hope is to provide a research
              experience that will get the students excited about applied mathematics and
              will attract them into doing graduate research in mathematics.
