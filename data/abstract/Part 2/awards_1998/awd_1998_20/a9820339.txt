Abstract    :
              This is a renewal of an REU site program.  It will provide summer research
              opportunities to undergraduates to work on problems in space physics and
              instrumentation related to space physics experiments.  Research topics cover a
              wide area of space physics and instrumentation.  Topics in solar physics
              include: computer modeling of solar flares, studies of the corona using data
              collected during solar eclipses, and modeling of coronal mass ejections. 
              Topics in Magnetospheric Physics include: computational simulations of plasma
              transport in the plasmasphere, simulations of turbulence in the plasma sphere,
              development of magnetometers for future small satellites, laboratory work using
              lasers to investigate the formation of plasma clouds from small objects of
              space debris.  Topics in Astrophysics include: studies of X-ray binaries using
              data from EUVE, ROSAT and BeppoSAX.  Topics in Optics and Materials Science
              include: computational ray tracing and testing of advanced mirrors and imaging
              systems and the Orbiting Wide-angle Light-collector project for studying the
              highest energy cosmic rays
