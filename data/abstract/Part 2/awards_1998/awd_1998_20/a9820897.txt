Abstract:

This project concerns research on
              algorithms, complexity, and their applications to database theory, economics
              and organization theory, and the life sciences.  In database theory it explores
              the indexability of database workloads, the applicability of spectral methods
              to information retrieval problems, new concepts and techniques in data mining,
              and novel languages for topological queries.  In applications, it investigates
              a novel model of organizations as information expediters; algorithmic questions
              that arise in relation to resource sharing and the information economy; the
              complexity of inferring the genetic basis of multigenic traits; as well as
              certain algorithmic problems arising in the modeling and analysis of cancer
              progress and protein folding.  In the core theory of algorithms and complexity,
              it investigates output-polynomial algorithms circuit minimization, and
              approximate algorithms for the traveling salesman problem.
