Abstract    :
                   This project proposes a combination of experimental, computational and
              analytical tools to address methods to minimize residual stresses and
              distortions in cast and heat-treated parts.  Ultimately, the project will lead
              to develop design models that can be readily used by manufacturing engineers.
              Specific interest is in solid ingots made of nickel-based alloys and hollow
              extruded shapes made of aluminum alloys.  The main objectives are to:  (1)
              study the effects of varying heat-transfer rates (Controllable Delayed
              Quenching) on residual stresses, thermal distortions and material properties;
              (2) develop design models to predict quench-part distortion in thin-walled
              extruded aluminum shapes; and (3) develop integrated process models to study
              the optimal combinations of quench parameters to reduce residual stresses in
              solid ingots made of high-strength Nickel-based alloys. 
     This project
              will help the materials processing industry involved in metalforming and
              heat-treatment to improve process design and product quality, reduce
              experimentation, improve the efficiency of thermal processes and hence decrease
              energy consumption.
