This award to University of Michigan will provide equipment in
              support of Great Lakes research on R/V Laurentian, a research vessel operated
              by the university as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System research fleet. Specific equipment to be acquired includes hand-held and
              mounted VHF radios for communication, GPS navigation instrumentation, an
              echosounder system with temperature and speed log capabilities, and night
              vision binoculars.   The shared-use equipment supported here will assist
              scientists to conduct studies from R/V Laurentian in  the Great Lakes during
              1999 and future years.
