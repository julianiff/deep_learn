Abstract    :
              Professor Richard D. Gonzalez' proposal is to maximize the performance of
              sulfated zirconia catalysts for n-butane isomerization by increasing the
              concentration of sulfate species that are active and resistant to coking.  The
              sulfated zirconia will be prepared by co-deposition of sol-gel zirconia and
              silica or deposition of sol-gel zirconia on high-surface area silica support,
              followed by thermal treatment and sulfation. Several techniques will be used to
              relate the synthesis and treatment procedure to the fraction of active sulfate
              species and the catalytic performance. They include: deactivation profiles from
              the reaction, thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR) of SO2 and CO2
              evolution, in particular SO2 at 600 C, coke deposition measured with TG-IR, and
              Broensted to Lewis acidity ratio determined by IR of adsorbed pyridine. The
              study's significance is based on the ongoing need for solid acid catalysts for
              alkane activation that would replace the environmentally risky liquid acid
              catalysts.
