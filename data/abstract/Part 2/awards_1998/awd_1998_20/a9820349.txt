The Georgia Institute of Technology will establish a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site for multidisciplinary
              materials research in structure-property correlations across length scales. 
              Ten undergraduate students will be recruited nationwide for a summer research
              experience, with a recruitment focus on students from institutions with limited
              graduate programs and from historically minority institutions.

Undergraduate
              students will be involved in research projects within the areas of
              characterization and modeling of damage behavior in metals, tailored structural
              composites, and processing and properties of application-specific novel
              materials.  In addition, REU participants will attend weekly seminars, field
              trips to regional research facilities and social activities.
