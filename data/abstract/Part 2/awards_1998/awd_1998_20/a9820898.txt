The recent identification of brown dwarfs
              in open clusters and in the solar neighborhood has been followed by the
              discovery of young brown dwarfs in regions of star formation. These discoveries
              are exciting in their own right, however, the number of known brown dwarfs
              remains small.  A collection of substellar objects in a star cluster will be
              studied to investigate how brown dwarfs form, the properties of their
              circumstellar disks, and their contribution to the total mass of the stellar
              cluster.  The regions of star formation are prime targets for brown dwarf
              searches because the substellar objects are localized in a small region and
              because they are much brighter in their youth.  In addition, extinction by the
              parent molecular cloud screens out background stars that could masquerade as
              young brown dwarfs.  Due to the presence of dust in these regions, infrared
              techniques are necessary for the study of populations of young brown
              dwarfs.

Near-infrared wavelength imaging and spectroscopy will be used to
              identify and characterize populations of brown dwarfs in the nearby rho
              Ophiuchi and NGC 1333 star-forming clouds.  Infrared imaging will be used to
              form a sample of brown dwarf candidates and low-resolution infrared
              spectroscopy will be used to identify candidates with cool photospheres.  The
              spectral types of the stars will be determined by measuring the depths of water
              vapor bands in the data in comparison to a grid of M dwarf spectral standards. 
              By deriving bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures from these data,
              we can compare them with theoretical models to determine their masses and ages.
               A preliminary study in the rho Ophiuchi cloud has refined the techniques and
              identified six probable brown dwarfs and another five objects at the
              stellar/substellar boundary.
