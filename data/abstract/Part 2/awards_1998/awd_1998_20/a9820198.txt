Description: This award is to support a US scientific
              delegation to the International Workshop on Sea Level Rise and Sustainable
              Coastal Management, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in March 1999.  The Principal
              Investigator is Professor Musharraf Zaman, of the Department of Civil
              Engineering and Environmental Science, University of Oklahoma, in Norman,
              Oklahoma.  The Bangladeshi organizer is Dr. A.K.M. Kamaluddin Choudhury of the
              Asia Pacific University.  The topics will cover: climate change, green house
              gas emission, global warming, sea level rise (SLR), social impacts of SLR, mean
              sea level determination and monitoring, land subsidence (natural and induced),
              coastal sedimentation and erosion, and climate change mitigation measures.  The
              objectives of the three-day workshop are: (1) review and discuss the current
              knowledge regarding factors contributing to seal level rise and the effect of
              SLR on land accretion and erosion, and (2) identify potentially productive
              areas for collaborative research.  The scientists plan to visit some of the
              sites most susceptible to damage as a result of sea level rise.

Scope:  This
              project will bring well known US specialists in climate studies, coastal area
              research, and in social science research with their counterparts in Bangladesh,
              and with participants from other countries, to develop an agenda for joint
              research in an important area of global change that is of interest to the two
              countries.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international
              workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual
              interest.
