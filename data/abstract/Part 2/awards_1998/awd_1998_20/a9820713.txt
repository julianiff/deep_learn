Modern electronic devices are solid structures of submicron
              feature
sizes.  Not only do they serve electronic functions, but also they
              must
maintain structural integrity during fabrication and use.  The field
              of
small structures is a relatively new one, to which solid
              mechanics
researchers can make substantial contributions.  This proposal
              addresses a
unifying theme for many problems in this field:  structural
              evolution.  In
a solid structure, diffusive processes can relocate mass, so
              that the
configuration of the structure may change over time.  For example, a
              film
may break into islands, and an interconnect may grow cavities. 
              While
studies of some of such phenomena go back many years, recent
              technological
developments demand much more sophisticated capabilities. 
              Today
general-purpose finite element codes can analyze stress fields in
              complex
structures.  However, no such a code exists to simulate evolving
              structures
with multiple energetic forces and kinetic processes.  A
              variational
approach developed recently offers an exiting prospect.  It
              extends the
established approach in continuum mechanics by including mass
              relocation as
an independent kinematic variable, in addition to deformation. 
              The
approach can include energetic forces ranging from mechanical stress
              to
electron wind, and kinetic processes ranging from grain boundary
              migration
to surface diffusion.  Attention in the past has been focused on
              specific
phenomena, such as epitaxial film instability and interconnect
              voiding.
This proposal addresses several basic issues that will arise
              in
implementing a general-purpose code.  Emphasis is placed on aspects
              related
to surface energy and elastic energy, because both energetics 
              are
ubiquitous in small solid structures, and because their
              implementation
issues are generic.  Specifically, we will examine the
              following aspects:
    *  Surface energy anisotropy
    *  Generalized forces
              due to elasticity
    *  Strain-dependent surface energy
We will develop
              their analytic basis for the finite element method,
implement them in our
              computer code, and use the code to simulate several
phenomena that highlight
              their effects.  The study of the phenomena at
small length and long time
              scales will push the envelope of the Solid
Mechanics discipline into a field
              of great scientific and technological
importance.
