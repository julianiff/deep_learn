CISE REU: Research
              Experience for Undergraduates in Process Automation and Device/Circuit Designs
              for Semiconductor Manufacturing

This Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site project supports ten students per year in programs carried out
              during the summers for two years.  The students work on projects involving
              process automation and device/circuit designs including work in robotics, image
              processing, and micro-electronic circuits.  The institution has strong
              cooperative plans with Bethune-Cookman College and also with Lucent and Harris
              corporations.  Students for the REU program are recruited nationwide, but the
              program focuses on students from the University of Central Florida,
              Bethune-Cookman College and nearby community colleges.  The REU students spend
              a part of their time at an industrial company, or at Oak Ridge National
              Laboratory, or in some cases at another nearby college.  The students are
              advised and reviewed by a team consisting of PIs, internal specialists, and
              outside experts.
