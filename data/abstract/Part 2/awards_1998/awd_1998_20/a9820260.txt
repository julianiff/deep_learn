Funding is provided as cost-sharing for a workshop to discuss
              the current capabilities and needs for long-term, high resolution time series
              observations, real time telemetry, and data assimilation requirements for in
              situ sensing of coastal ecosystems.  The workshop organizers have secured
              multi-agency (NSF, NOAA, NASA, ONR, EPA, and MMS) support for this effort. 
              They intend to invite approximately 75 participants who are recognized for
              their research on coastal ecosystems and/or development and use of in situ
              sensors for a four-day workshop. In addition, 15-20 observers from government
              agencies are expected to attend.  The workshop's overall goal is to evaluate
              the need for in situ measurements and real-time telemetry, promote more
              effective "end-to-end" linkages between measurements, data assimilation,
              synthesis and applications; and catalyze comparative analysis of environmental
              issues. 

The workshop participants will be asked to address three related
              issues: 1) detecting and predicting change in coastal ecosystems; 2)
              monitoring-capabilities and information needs; and 3) the design and
              implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary coastal observing systems.  The
              product of the workshop will be a report that will present a coherent and
              comprehensive plan for designing and implementing integrated coastal observing
              systems that are responsive to user needs.  Results of the workshop will be
              presented at AGU, ASLO and EFR meetings within one year of the completion of
              the workshop.
