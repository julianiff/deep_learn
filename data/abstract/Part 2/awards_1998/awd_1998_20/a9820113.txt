The potential role of controlling and manipulating the
              mechanical behavior of cells in order to alter matrix production is an exciting
              aspect of cell biology behavior that may have substantial impact in tissue
              engineering, i.e. repair of damaged tissue or generation of new tissue using a
              combination of engineering and biological means.  However, because of previous
              technological limitations, investigations of the mechanical behavior of whole
              cells have been of only a limited nature.  The goal of this pilot experiment is
              to develop a collaboration between a group of investigators with expertise in
              biomechanics, Micro-Electro-Mechanical- Systems (MEMS), and cell biology, in
              order to initiate development of a new class of cell testing devices.  MEMS
              technology is a branch of engineering that is focused on development of
              machines that operate at the scale of microns. This new "Bio-MEMS" device will
              enable characterization of the mechanical behavior of individual live cells,
              for static compressive loads, and ultimately, for more complex loading.  This
              work is significant in that it will provide the basis for continued
              developmental work on such devices, collection of important preliminary data
              for support of further research on a larger scale, and will establish a close
              collaboration between an unique set of faculty with a common interest in tissue
              engineering.
