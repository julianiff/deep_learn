Title: Antarctic Clouds and
              Climate

The proposed work will study the role of Antarctic clouds in the
              global climate system. It is proposed to increase the realism of simulated
              Antarctic clouds in the NCAR CCM3.  Satellite and ground-based observations
              will be analyzed to enhance the understanding of Antarctic clouds.  On the
              basis of these, a number of changes will be implemented in the model; the local
              and remote impacts of these changes will be examined by conducting CCM3
              sensitivity runs.  The study will result in the CSM producing more realistic
              atmospheric variability as well as better simulation of sea ice behavior and
              associated thermohaline circulation of the Southern Ocean in climate change
              scenarios.  The work is important because it will lead to better modeling of
              processes in the Southern Oceans.
