Abstract    :
              This grant will support participation by US scientists at the Engineering
              Foundation Conference on Micro- gravity Fluid Physics and Heat Transfer in
              Oahu, Hawaii, September 19-24, 1999.  Over the last several years many
              investigators have been carrying out research to understand the role of various
              transport pheno- mena under reduced gravity.  Experiments have been performed
              on the Space Shuttle under prolonged duration of microgravity.  These
              experiments have provided insight into the physics of various phenomena under
              microgravity conditions and in some cases have demonstrated the lack of
              understanding of the phenomena.  The conference will provide a forum for the
              synthesis of the knowledge base that has been developed in micro- gravity heat
              transfer and in isolating the key issues that need to be addressed in future
              research.  Technical sessions will be on drops, bubbles, and particles; pool
              and flow boiling; flow regimes and two phase pressure drop; thermocapillary
              flows, bio-fluid mechanics; interfacial phenomena; fluid management; and heat
              pipes.  The proceedings will be published within six months of the conference.
