REU:  Summer Undergraduate
              Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley

This Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports six students per year in programs
              carried out during the summers for three years.  The students work on projects
              involving new architectural solutions for the converged information and
              communications networks of the next century.  Projects include networking and
              quality of service, Internet demand, wireless communication, video compression,
              neural models and language learning, computer-telephony integration and other
              related areas.

Students are matched with faculty and graduate student
              mentors on the basis of interests.  The project recruits students nationwide
              and the department has a strong tradition of undergraduate participation in
              research as well as to diversity.  The evaluation plan calls for systematic
              tracking of the REU students and the program's effect on their educational
              plans after participation.
