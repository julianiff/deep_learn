Abstract    :
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution offers a 12 week Summer Student Fellowship
              Program for Undergraduates (juniors or seniors).  Students participate in
              individual research projects under the sponsorship of a mentor.  Students have
              the opportunity to carry out basic and applied research in five departments
              (Biology, Geology and Geophysics , Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, Physical
              Oceanography and Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering) and in the Marine
              Policy Center.  Students will use the latest tools in ocean science and
              engineering.  The Summer Student Fellowship experience provides students with a
              sense of the process of scholarly research; conception of the idea, formulation
              of the research plan, execution of the research, assessment of the results, and
              oral and written communication to peers.  Students attend a series of special
              seminars designed specifically to acquaint them with the broad scope of the
              research ongoing in the Institution and in the oceanographic community at
              large.
