Abstract    :
              The Department of Molecular Biosciences at The University of Kansas will
              continue its summer program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates in
              Molecular Biosciences, for 10 weeks in the summers of 1999-2001.  Recognizing
              the pivotal role of independent laboratory research in their students'
              decisions to make a commitment to research careers in the biological sciences,
              this opportunity to students from colleges with limited research opportunities,
              and to members of groups traditionally underrepresented.  This program focuses
              on several overlapping areas of biochemistry and cellular, molecular, and
              developmental biology, principally protein structure and function, enzyme
              mechanisms, and protein engineering; proteins involved in cytoskeletal
              structure; the structure, function, and regulation of membrane
              proteins-receptors, ion channels and ion transporters-and of their genes; and
              molecular analysis of signal transduction cascades in microbial metabolism and
              eukaryotic developmental biology.
To maximize the unique opportunities offered
              at The University of Kansas, students will be involved in collaborative
              projects combining classical protein structure analysis, molecular genetics,
              and physical biochemical approaches. This experience will provide the students
              with an inside view of these areas of biochemistry and molecular biology that
              may previously have seemed inaccessible to them. Undergraduate research is
              performed in a closely mentored and well-controlled environment. We have
              repeatedly seen, in students and in the REU participants, the wakening of
              excitement and the realization that a career in science was accessible which
              were made possible by an early hands-on experience using powerful techniques to
              approach important biological questions.
