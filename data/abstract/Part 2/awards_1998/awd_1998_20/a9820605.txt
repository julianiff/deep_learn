This project will provide an interdisciplinary summer
              research experience for a total of ten majors in geology, biology, and
              chemistry.  The participants will be rising juniors and seniors with about half
              coming from Furman University and about half from other institutions.  The
              research will focus on an interdisciplinary study of water quality in the
              Enoree River Basin of South Carolina.  Students will be divided into
              interdisciplinary teams and study the watershed of an Enoree River tributary. 
              The student teams will study land use patterns, hydrology, water chemistry,
              microbiology, and fish populations in order to determine water quality of the
              watershed.  Student teams will interpret the relationships between the water
              quality parameters themselves.  The goal of the project is to introduce
              students to the process of scientific problem solving and the interdisciplinary
              teamwork needed to solve environmental problems.  As the summer progresses,
              student teams will be encouraged to become increasingly independent from the
              faculty team.
