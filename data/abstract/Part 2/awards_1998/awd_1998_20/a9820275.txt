Hydrologic Sciences, as a distinct, new, interdisciplinary
              Geoscience, was conceived in 1991 in a report of the National Research Council
              called "Opportunities in Hydrologic Sciences".  A new initiative by the
              Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) called GEO-2000 offers a unique opportunity
              for the broad hydrology community to take steps to develop a comprehensive,
              long ten-n plan which can serve as a basis to enhance base funding in
              hydrologic sciences at NSF.  Simultaneously, this plan would provide a basis
              for taking stock of ma or accomplishments and advancements which would result
              from an enhanced funding base, and identifying future needs.  This proposal
              addresses how such a plan can be developed and implemented within a broad
              scientific framework involving three steps.  The first step is to prepare a
              'concept paper' or a 'science plan'.  The second step is to organize a small
              workshop in which the science plan will serve as a discussion document.  The
              workshop will send its 'initial recommendations' to GEO by February 28, 1999. 
              The third step is to widely publicize the outcome of the first two steps, and
              seek input from the broad national and international hydrology community.  This
              third step will serve as the basis for making appropriate revisions into
              initial recommendations, preparing a set of 'revised recommendations' for the
              'GEO-2000 report' by the fall of 1999, and making plans for future action items
              beyond GEO-2000.
