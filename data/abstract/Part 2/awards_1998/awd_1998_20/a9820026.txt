Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for the PIs to establish 2 seafloor geodetic reference points
              on the South American Plate 20 and 50 km upslope of the Peru-Chile Trench at 12
              degrees S.  Measurements (with 1 cm uncertainty) will be made in the years 2000
              and 2002 that will provide informaiton about the mode of deformation of Nazca
              subduction zone.  Partial and full locking as well as stable sliding scenarios
              will be tested.  The work will improve our understanding of the dynamics of
              ocean-continent plate convergence.
