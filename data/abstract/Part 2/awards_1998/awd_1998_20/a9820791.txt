Abstract    :
              This research project deals with fundamental questions in solution phase radical
              chemistry using time-resolved paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy of
              spin-correlated radical pairs and biradicals.  Such concerns as the
              quantification of the exchange interaction between the unpaired electrons of
              such species will be addressed.  These issues will be related to theoretical
              simulations of the TREPR experiment, so that issues of time and space can be
              resolved, and the results related to chemical reactions beyond the immediate
              scope of the proposed experiments.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of
              Professor Malcolm D. E. Forbes of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
              Hill.  Professor Forbes research delves into the intimate nature of electrons
              as they interact in the intermediate stages of chemical reactions.  Such
              fundamental knowledge contributes to our understanding of how chemical
              reactions work, including those involving biomolecules and in living systems.
