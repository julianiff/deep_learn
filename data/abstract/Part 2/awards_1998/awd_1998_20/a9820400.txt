Abstract    :
              Ten undergraduates will engage in cutting edge bench research in marine,
              molecular physiology for an 8-week period at the Mount Desert Island Biological
              Laboratory on the coast of Maine. Each student will be assigned to a research
              group of his/her choice in fields such as reproduction, endocrinology,
              osmoregulation, cell membrane transport, cardiovascular, kidney function, cell
              structure and function, or environmental toxicology. Experimental models will
              include sharks, skates, flounder, sculpin, crabs, snails and other
              invertebrates. Research techniques will encompass molecular biology (PCR,
              cloning, sequencing), tissue culture, electrophysiology (patch clamping,
              expression in xenopus oocytes), confocal microscopy and other commonly used
              physiological techniques such as organ perfusion and Ussing chamber
              studies.

Students participate in several Laboratory-wide activities
              including weekly Monday morning cell membrane transport lectures, Tuesday
              evening basic concept talks by scientist and the students working with them,
              Wednesday evening formal lectures given by invited speakers who address topics
              of interest to the Lab, Thursday noon ethics in science seminars, and Friday
              noon "brown bag" seminars given by MDIBL scientists about their ongoing
              research.

Towards the end of the research experience, undergraduates present
              short talks about their summer' s research results and write, with the senior
              scientist, a scientific paper on their work for publication in the Bulletin of
              the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory.
