Abstract    :
              We propose a novel cohesive theory of fracture based on a method of constructing
              continuum constitutive models from an empirical cohesive force law. This theory
              is aimed to overcome some of the limitations of the conventional theory of
              fracture mechanics  applications involving crack nucleation and growth in
              micron scale structures where fracture toughness becomes sensitively dependent
              on device geometry. In comparison with the cohesive surface models (Xu and
              Needleman, 1994; Camacho and Ortiz, 1996) in which a set of discrete cohesive
              surfaces having finite work of fracture and finite cohesive strength is
              introduced at the stage of finite element discretization, we propose to embed a
              cohesive force law directly into the constitutive model. Our preliminary
              studies (Gao and Klein, 1998; Klein and Gao, 1998) have shown that this type of
              approach is practically feasible.
