Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to continue support for the REU (Research Experience
              for Undergraduates) site at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and
              Technology, University of Hawaii.  Since 1988, this REU site has provided
              qualified undergraduate students with the opportunity for meaningful
              involvement in research in oceanography and related marine sciences.  Students
              are selected competitively from throughout the continental U.S. and
              U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.  During an intensive 10-week summer program,
              they work one-on-one with SOEST faculty mentors on a wide variety of topics in
              the traditional subdisciplines of physical, chemical, geological and biological
              oceanography, marine biology, fisheries, aquatic pollution, or at the
              interfaces of ocean, earth and atmospheric realms.  The student actively
              participate in developing and implementing individual research projects,
              collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, and presenting their
              findings in oral seminars and written reports.  Over the past six years,
              funding from this REU site grant has provided research experiences for 59
              undergraduate students from 45 colleges and universities.  Of the students who
              have completed undergraduate studies during this time, 84% are currently
              pursuing careers in scientific research (including medicine).
