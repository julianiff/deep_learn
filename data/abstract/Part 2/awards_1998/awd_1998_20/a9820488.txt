The Research Grants Program of the Geological Society of
              America is a major source of funding for graduate student research in the earth
              sciences.  Provided a three-year renewal of the program is at a higher funding
              level to permit the program to offer significantly increased awards, and
              attract a larger pool of applicants.  NSF funding will allow the GSA and the
              Geological Society of America Foundation (GSAF) to continue expanding their
              financial base by relieving these organizations of the entire financial burden
              connected with the program over the grant period.  GSA/GSAF support for this
              program beyond the period of this request will be increased to the level of
              sustaining the program without NSF support.  GSA will bear all costs of
              administration as it did under the previous grant, with 100% of NSF funds going
              to program awards.
