Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. Thomas F. Moran and David M.
              Collard in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of
              Technology.  The ten participants, recruited nationally, will take part in
              projects chosen from at least eighteen ongoing activities involving analytical,
              biological, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry.  Regular research
              conferences and oral presentations will serve to acquaint every participant
              with the nature of all other projects and provide a basis for individual
              discussions.
