This three-year award supports US-UK and US-Greece
              cooperative research in structural mechanics and control system engineering
              between Dennis Bernstein of the University of Michigan and Matthew Cartmell at
              the University of Glasgow and Spilios Fassois of the University of Patras.  The
              objective of their research is to study the modeling, identification, and
              control for self-oscillating systems.  Their approach to this problem involves
              physical acoustic modeling, energy flow analysis, kinetic modeling,
              identification, and adaptive control. 

The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in control.  This is complemented by UK expertise in
              modeling and Greek expertise in identification.  The objectives of the project
              are to develop and analyze low-dimensional universal models for arbitrary
              self-oscillating systems, develop identification techniques based on
              linear/nonlinear feedback, and develop direct adaptive control techniques. 
              Self-oscillating systems are of extremely broad application and intense current
              interest.  They include aerodynamic systems, aeroelastic systems,
              thermoacoustic systems, rotating systems, systems with hysteresis, and systems
              with contact instabilities.
