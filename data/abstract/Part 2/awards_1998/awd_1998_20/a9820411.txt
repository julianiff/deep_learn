This award to Bermuda Biological Station for Research will
              provide equipment in support of oceanographic research on R/V Weatherbird II, a
              research vessel operated by the BBSR as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific equipment to be
              acquired includes an instrumented level wind system for the hydrographic winch,
              an instrumented sheave system for the clean water sampling winch, slip rings,
              and a compact hydrographic winch.   The shared-use equipment supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies from R/V Weatherbird,
              particularly in  the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, during 1999 and future years.
