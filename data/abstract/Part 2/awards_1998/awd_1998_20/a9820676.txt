This award to Duke University will provide instrumentation for
              oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Hatteras, a research vessel operated
              by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a box corer and grab sampler for marine geological studies
              and radio and light beacons for locating and tracking instruments. Funds are
              also provided for replacing ten shipboard computer monitors.  The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly along the mid-Atlantic U.S. margin, in 1999 and future
              years.
