This award supports a series of projects in the general area of
              single- and multi-bubble sonoluminescence.  One set of experiments will seek to
              determine if there is any fundamental relationship between the continuum
              emission in single-bubble sonoluminescence and the underlying continuum
              associated with multi-bubble sonoluminescence, in particular, as a function of
              the solvent being used.  Attempts will be made to create an environment in
              which stable single-bubble sonoluminescence can exist.  The robustness of
              single-bubble sonoluminescence under different circumstances will be studied as
              a means of identifying the underlying principles causing the phenomenon to
              occur.
