Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Site in Archaeology.  The program provides undergraduate students an
              opportunity to join the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus.  Ten
              students will (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques
              (e.g., remote sensing, computer-assisted mapping), record keeping and data
              management, and artifact analysis, (2) participate in seminars taught by
              experts on archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of Cyprus,
              (3) visit other archaeological sites and museums on Cyprus, (4) plan and
              complete an independent research project, and (5) live in Athienou and learn
              about life in modern Cyprus from the villagers.  The students will master the
              methods of archaeological field research, gain a better understanding of
              archaeological theory, and gain confidence in their abilities to work as
              scientists.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
              attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
              research experiences.
