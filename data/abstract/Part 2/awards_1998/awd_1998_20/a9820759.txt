Abstract    :
              Chave/ Filloux
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget
              for the region. A companion modeling effort will focus primarily on the issue
              of tidal scattering as an energy source for ocean mixing while a historical
              analysis of data collected in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands will help
              guide the survey program in determining the location and ubiquity of regions
              where strong mixing activity takes place. Under this particular component of
              the Farfield experiment, an array of horizontal electrometer and bottom
              pressure recorders will be deployed on either side of the Hawaiian Ridge to
              complement a tomographic array. The objective is to quantify the barotropic
              energy flux convergence at the Ridge and the flux divergence associated with
              low mode baroclinic waves radiation. The difference is a measure of the tidal
              power available for mixing at the Ridge.
