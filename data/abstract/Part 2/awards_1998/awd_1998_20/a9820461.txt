Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a three-year research program under which basic
              plasma physical processes that appear to be responsible for the surprisingly
              strong energetics that have been observed in the midlatitude E region will be
              studied. The experiments will center around measurements to be made with a
              frequency-agile radar (FAR), with plans to culminate this research program with
              a second SEEK rocket campaign (SEEK-2) in 2001.  The first ground-based
              investigations of the electron heating events mentioned above will be pursued. 
              Thus far, this phenomenon has been detected only by a handful of sounding
              rockets launched over a 20 year period.  From these measurements a
              comprehensive description of the Sq current system and the conditions under
              which electron heating events are observed will become evident.
