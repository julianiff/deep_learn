Abstract    :
              Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab (DISL) will offer a twelve-week, fall semester,
              research experience for seven undergraduate students interested in pursuing
              careers in the marine sciences.  Located on Dauphin Island in the northeastern
              Gulf of Mexico south of Mobile, Alabama, the DISL provides courses and research
              facilities for undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty from 22
              colleges and universities in Alabama and visitors from throughout the U.S.  The
              setting also permits students transfer research knowledge to K-12 students and
              the public through the Discovery Hall Programs at the lab.  Participants in the
              undergraduate research program will design, implement and report on independent
              laboratory and research projects within an active research and education
              program.  Students will be matched with appropriate faculty who will guide
              student in their research projects.  Research areas include, for example: the
              ecology of early life history stages of!  marine and estuarine fishes; coral
              reef ecology; the role of microorganisms in cycling of organic and inorganic
              matter in the marine environment; phytoplankton and zooplankton ecology; the
              evolution of benthic communities; the role of biomechanics and hydrodynamics in
              the ecology and evolution of benthic communities; and plant-animal interactions
              in seagrass ecosystems.  The program seeks to attract and retain talented
              students in the sciences by providing exposure to, and interaction with, strong
              role models in a robust academic and research setting.
