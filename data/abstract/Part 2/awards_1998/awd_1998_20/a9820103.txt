Funds are provided to develop and implement near
              real-time image processing
and bi-directional telemetry capabilities for the
              Autonomous Vertically
Profiling Plankton Observatory (AVPPO).   AVPPO was
              designed to collect
high-resolution time-series data on the vertical position
              and taxonomic
composition of the plankton together with ancillary
              environmental data on
spatial scales of mm to 100 m in high-energy Shelf
              regions of the ocean.
Presently, AVPPO stores all hydrographic and video data
              on video tape,
which  is the limiting factor for deployment length.  Further
              development
will enable the processing of both the hydrographic and video data
              in
real-time, thereby allowing rapid data transmission to shore after
              each
profile. A single high-resolution digital camera will replace two
              standard
video cameras. Video data will be compressed 90 fold using new
              wavelet
compression technology then recorded on a 6 Gb hard drive for a
              maximum of
about 30 h continuous recording, thus extending the profiler's
              capability
to about 300 profiles from 100 m depth. Full duplex
              interactive
communications through VHF, cellular phone, and possibly satellite
              links
depending on the bandwidth requirements of the sensor systems will also
              be
implemented. Ultimately, this technology will allow
              long-term,
high-frequency monitoring of critical environmental variables which
              would
be impossible by conventional sampling systems.
