Abstract    :
              

The proposal is submitted as a continuation to a program which was funded by
              NSF (ECS-9628973).  In the previous program, quantum dot room-temperature
              interband lasers and intersubband (17 micron) detectors have been realized and
              reported. The research in the new proposal is to expand the work to include
              studies in far-IR intersubband emitters and detectors based on "self-organized"
              quantum dots.
