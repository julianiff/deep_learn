This project will investigate a novel
              process for making lightweight, relatively inexpensive, meter-class mirrors for
              millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radio telescopes.  The process involves
              capping a rigid volume with a thin, reflective, stretchable material.  The
              volume is then evacuated, or pressurized to form the membrane into a curved
              mirror.  The shape of the mirror is controlled by the shape of the boundary,
              the mechanical characteristics of the membrane material, and the pressure. 
              This project will quantify the shape and surface characteristics of mirrors
              produced from various materials, and demonstrate operation of a meter-class
              telescope using membrane mirrors.
