Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide a research experience in
discrete
              mathematics for six highly talented undergraduate mathematics
students during
              each of the summers of 1999, 2000 and 2001. The principal
investigator and an
              assistant will supervise the work. The undergraduate
participants will also
              interact mathematical and socially with former 
program participants who will
              be visiting the program.

The program has a twenty-one year history of
              attracting extraordinary
students and producing papers in well regarded
              professional research
journals.
