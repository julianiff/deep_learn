The Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) is
              a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site that has activities to
              introduce undergraduate students to high-level, professionally guided, research
              in astronomy and astrophysics.  The Maria Mitchell Observatory is located in
              Nantucket, Massachusetts.  The students will have the opportunity to acquire
              teaching experience by taking part in the MMO public outreach programs.   The
              Nantucket Maria Mitchell Association has invited undergraduate students to
              conduct research at the MMO for 42 years.  Each student and supervisor
              cooperatively plans the project, including the definition of the research topic
              and the writing of a scientific paper.  The students have the opportunity to
              present their results at a local or national professional meeting.  The results
              of the research are often submitted to refereed professional journals for
              publication. The directions of scientific research at the MMO include
              multi-wavelength studies of astronomical objects ranging from comets to stars,
              to circumstellar and interstellar matter, and to other galaxies.  In addition
              to each student's individual project in one of these fields, the student
              participates in a common scientific project.  The data for the research
              projects are obtained from various ground-based and space-based observatories. 
              Students have access to the photographic plate collections of the MMO and the
              Harvard College Observatory to obtain historical data.  The data from these
              photographic plate collections are used to reconstruct the long-term light
              curves of unusual variable stars.  The research activities by the students
              involve state-of-the-art data reduction techniques and thoughtful physical
              interpretations.  Students may also pursue studies in theoretical astrophysics.
