The characteristics of stars populating our galaxy
              are broadly inferred from the observed properties of the nearby stars.  This is
              the sample we might expect to be known most completely, down to the very
              faintest stars possible, and to have the best observational data.  In fact,
              many of the nearest stars lack basic measurements such as colors, spectral
              types, and especially distances, and many new objects are yet to be discovered.
               Dr. Ianna's program focuses on providing these basic data and on expanding the
              sample of nearby stars through determination of distances by the trigonometric
              parallax method emphasizing CCD observations from the southern hemisphere.  His
              program includes some of the faintest known stars, several brown dwarfs, and
              subdwarfs, stars from the oldest populations in our galaxy.  His surveys will
              also discover binary stars, for which masses will be determined.  The program
              of observations will help to complete the stellar census of the solar
              neighborhood, clarify the form of the faint end of the luminosity and mass
              distribution functions, and contribute to our understanding of the formation
              and evolution of stellar populations.
