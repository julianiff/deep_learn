Abstract    :
              There is a perception among certain members of the artificial intelligence
              community that the logic-based approach to AI has not been sufficiently
              recognized as important at  NSF. This workshop will bring together leading
              researchers in the logic-based AI community, to provide them with an
              opportunity to exchange information in their sub-disciplines, to learn about
              related work in logic-based AI, and to assess the direction of the field as a
              whole. A report to NSF will describes important current themes in the field
              which are worthy of research support, and will provide an assessment of an area
              of research that some of the leading figures in artificial intelligence believe
              to be among the most promising for significant future advances.  NSF funds will
              be used to partially support attendees who do not have sufficient funds to come
              otherwise, as well as a small number of student attendees; no funds will be
              used for overhead or for the PIs. The University of Maryland Institute for
              Advanced Computer Studies will contribute approximately $5,000 to defray the
              charge for use of the conference rooms, to provide preprints of papers, and for
              other incidentals.
