This awards supports travel of 15 US participants in the
              US-Europe Workshop on Model Theory of Henselian Valued Fields, co-organized by
              Deirdre Haskell of the College of Holy Cross and H. Dugald Macpherson of the
              University of Leeds.  The workshop will take place at the International Center
              for the Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, May 16-23, 1999.  
              NSF will fund the US mathematicians and graduate students and the Engineering
              and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom will fund 14
              mathematicians from the UK, France, Germany, Russia, Israel and Canada. The
              objectives of the workshops are to develop new collaborations and identify
              research in five topics:  (1) rigid algebraic geometry, (2) motivic
              integration, (3) variants of o-minimality and VC dimension, (4) imaginaries and
              interpretability in valued fields, and (5) valuations, derivations and
              automorphisms.
