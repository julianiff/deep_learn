Abstract    :
              This project is focused on two areas.  The first is applying techniques
              developed for randomized algorithms to traditional matrix problems that have to
              be solved for very large matrices.  In particular, the problem of finding an
              approximation to a given matrix having a fixed rank.  If the matrix is the
              adjacency matrix of a graph, connection has been developed between such
              approximations and certain partitions of the vertex set of the graph.  The
              second area is approximation algorithms for convex sets.
