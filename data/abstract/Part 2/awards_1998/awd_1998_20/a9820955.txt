Abstract    :
              9820955  Uzi Vishkin University of Maryland

The PI will work towards rapid
              compiler prototyping for the Explicit Multi-Threading (XMT) project at the
              University of Maryland.  This target "approximate" compiler will correctly
              translate a high-level code into the assembly code for the XMT architecture;
              the performance of the assembly code is expected be within some small
              percentage from optimal.  One graduate student will devote a full year to this
              effort. In a second project, the PI plans to design an on-chip interconnect for
              the memory system.  This will explore several alternative ways for connecting
              the local registers in eash thread control unit (TCU) with the first level of
              the memory, which is to be interleaved; this is a demanding challenge as the
              interconnect needs to provide high bandwidth and low latency.
A second
              graduate student will devode a full year to this effort.
