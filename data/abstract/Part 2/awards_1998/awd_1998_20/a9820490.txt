Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Leonard W. Fine in the Department
              of Chemistry at Columbia University.  The ten participants, recruited
              nationally, will learn about research first hand by joining one of the twenty
              two research groups within the department for an intensive summer research
              experience.  Increased understanding of the research process will be gained
              through regular seminars, group meetings and symposia.  Field trips to
              industrial sites and training in publication preparation and research
              presentation are also part of the program.  Communication of research results
              will be stressed, careers in chemistry and graduate school counseling will be
              provided and ethical issues in research and science will be discussed.
