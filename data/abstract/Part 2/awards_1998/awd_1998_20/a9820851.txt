This award to University of Washington will provide equipment
              in support of oceanographic research on R/V Barnes and R/V Thompson, two
              research vessels operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific equipment to be
              acquired includes an ultrasound wind sensor, computers for bridge operations,
              and air winch for Thompson, an emergency steering system, transducers and
              transceivers, refurbishment of the CTD winch and a new outboard motor for the
              inflatable boat on R/V Barnes, and a forklift for general vessel support of
              loading and offloading.   The shared-use equipment supported here will assist
              marine scientists conduct studies from these two research vessels, particularly
              in  the Northeast Pacific Ocean, but also worldwide on R/V Thompson, during
              1999 and future years.
