Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop an intelligent visual database system
              that enables learning from user search patterns to automatically extract and
              annotate semantic objects in a large collection of images (i.e., learning by
              example). To this effect, the approach used in this project is based on a
              content-based hierarchical representation of images, where low-level
              homogeneous color regions (elementary regions) form the lowest level in the
              hierarchy. Higher-level (composite) nodes are formed by selected combinations
              of these regions that match in color and/or shape one or more example templates
              provided by the user. Composite nodes correspond to semantic objects that are
              generated automatically according to our learning by example procedure. A
              hierarchical content matching procedure is also developed, where the
              hierarchical image representation is searched in a top-down fashion. This
              procedure enables very efficient retrieval of images containing the "learned"
              objects in subsequent searches. The results of this research will yield
              procedures for automatic segmentation of semantic objects according to user
              provided example templates for automatic indexing of large visual databases,
              and very fast retrieval of images containing such objects in visual databases
              that employ the developed hierarchical content representation.
