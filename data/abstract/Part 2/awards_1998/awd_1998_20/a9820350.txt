Abstract    :
              We propose the continuation of all interdisciplinary REU program, Research
              Internships in Neural and Behavioral Sciences, for 10 Native American,
              Hispanic, and African American students, and White students who are the first
              generation of their family in college. Under the guidance of scientists from
              the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of psychology,
              students will conduct research in neural and behavioral sciences.
This 10-week
              summer research internship integrates four major components: (1) Faculty
              mentors provide hands-on research experience to students in faculty
              laboratories, fostering the excitement of scientific discovery. (2) In an
              orientation program, students receive instruction in laboratory techniques in
              the neural and behavioral sciences. (3) Professional development seminars are
              presented covering topics such as how to apply to graduate school. (4) NAU
              faculty present discussions of ethical issues in science.
We seek funding so
              that we may continue to prepare minority students and other students who are
              first generation of their families in college for graduate admission in the
              Neural and Behavioral Sciences. We will continue to refine our program based on
              evaluation results, the input of faculty mentors and current and former
              students, and the findings of social and educational research.
