Abstract    :
              Hope College will host an REU program for six undergraduates in mathematics in
              the summers of 1999-2002.  Publicized widely, at least half of the students
              will be from outside of Hope College.  Students will typically work in groups
              of two with one of three faculty mentors. Projects will be chosen from algebra
              and analysis.

Primary goals are to help talented students develop as
              mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research as a career, and to
              have the participants achieve significant mathematical results in partnership
              with a faculty mentor.  Moreover, students will be encouraged and partially
              funded to present their work at professional meetings and in published
              form.

The program will be eight weeks.  Student pairs will be given their
              own project or problem to solve.  After introductory lectures given by the
              faculty researchers, students will be set loose to tackle their own problems
              which will initially involve reading background material and library research. 
              Students will generally meet with their faculty mentors daily.  Toward the end
              of the project, students will write and present papers on their research.
