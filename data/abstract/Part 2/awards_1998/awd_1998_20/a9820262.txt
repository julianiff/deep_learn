Abstract    :
              RFP No. EHR 98-027: "Technical Support to the Awardees of the National Science
              Foundation's Comprehensive Partnerships for Mathematics and Science
              Achievement, Rural Systemic Initiatives, Statewide Systemic Initiatives, and
              Urban Systemic Initiatives programs."

The RFP asks that the Bidder for this
              sole source request to The McKenzie Group (TMG) develop a work plan and budget
              for the provision of technical support and communication services to the EHR
              Systemic Initiatives (SI) programs including the Comprehensive Partnerships for
              Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA), Rural Systemic Initiatives (RSI),
              Statewide Systemic Initiatives (SSI), and the Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI).
               These services include the following: (1) support for implementation of K-12
              science and mathematics curriculum standards, for integration of the use of
              educational technology into the delivery of mathematics and science, for
              development of a high quality instructional workforce, and for implementation
              of a standards-based student assessment system in the USI/CPMSA sites; (2) help
              in developing community understanding of and resources for systemic reform in
              all of the SI programs; (3) support for the development of a plan to provide
              high quality science and mathematics instruction in all RSI sites; and, (4)
              building linkages between present SSIs and alumni SSIs and other states.  The
              RFP also requires TMG to develop a plan to use electronic media to increase the
              ability of all SI award sites to share best practices and solve problems they
              have in common.
