Abstract    :
              The antarctic marine environment is characterized by constant, low water
              temperatures yet marked seasonal patterns of pack-ice movement and photoperiod.
              The offshore biotic system is fueled by upwelled, nutrient-rich, deep
              circumpolar water, which supports rich primary production during the Antarctic
              austral summer. Although antarctic marine biology is a relative young science,
              research has gone far beyond descriptions of plants and animals found in
              antarctic waters. More fundamental aspects of how these biota live and interact
              in such an extreme environment have been studied. This unique marine
              environment provides an opportunity to present a broadly based symposium on
              aspects of the biology of the rich and diverse marine life in Antarctica. This
              project will support a symposium on "Antarctic Marine Biology" to be held at
              the January, 2000 meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative
              Biology. General topics to be addressed include marine microbial processes,
              physiology of sea ice microalgae, the energetics and reproduction of krill,
              seals and penguins, strategies of photothermal acclimation in macroalge, the
              physiology and development of marine invertebrates and the origin and evolution
              of fish antifreezes. The integrative and comparative nature of the
              presentations will have broad scientific appeal. The proceedings will be
              available to the general scientific community through publication in the
              American Zoologist.
