The
              Sensitivity of Structure-from-Motion:   A Comprehensive Theoretical and
              Experimental Study


This is a three year standard award. The PI will carry
              out a general theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the
              sensitivity of structure-from-motion (SFM).  This task requires the development
              of techniques that extend the state of the art not only of computer vision but
              also of statistical parameter estimation.  Specifically, methods for
              propagating full densities from measurements to unknowns will be developed for
              nonsquare problems (more measurements than unknowns), and standard covariance
              propagation techniques will be extended to constrained optimization problems
              with implicit formulations.  New techniques will be developed for the
              decomposition of ill-posed problems into solvable and unsolvable components. 
              Using these techniques, the sensitivity of standard formulations of SFM  will
              be analyzed systematically, and without the use of noise generators.   In
              addition, the effects of nonlinearities will be understood more completely than
              in previous studies.   Comparison with experimental results, made possible by
              newly proposed calibration methods, will validate the theoretical conclusions
              and will lead to a clear delineation of which SFM computations are possible
              with a given level of camera quality and for a given performance requirement. 
              The decomposition of SFM problems into solvable and unsolvable components, as
              well as the partition of performance space into feasible and infeasible
              problems, will lead to a new algorithm that combines successful special-case
              algorithms in a principled and general way.
