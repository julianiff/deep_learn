Support is requested for the continuation of the
              GT-SUPREEM program, in which the 
Georgia Institute of Technology serves as a
              NSF REU site.  GT-SUPREEM is a ten-week summer 
research program designed to
              attract qualified minority students into the field of electrical 
engineering.
               Ten students of at least junior-level undergraduate standing will be recruited
              annually 
on a nationwide basis and paired with both a faculty and a graduate
              student mentor to undertake 
research projects in the Georgia Tech School of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The students 
will be housed on campus,
              and in addition to lodging, meals, and a travel allowance, will be provided
              
with a $4,000 stipend.  At the conclusion of the summer, the students will be
              expected to prepare 
both oral and written summaries of their research
              projects.  It is anticipated that this experience will 
encourage these
              students to become applicants for graduate school in the ensuing years.  Three
              years 
of support are requested.
