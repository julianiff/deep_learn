Dr. Backer
              will carry out studies of Sgr A* and the Crab nebula and pulsar using a variety
              of radio telescopes and instrumentation.  The studies are unified by the theme
              of high energy plasma astrophysics and the common technique of using
              distortions in the interstellar medium as probes of the nature of the object. 
              Studies of the radio source at the galactic center, Sgr A* will include
              imaging, investigations of the nature of its temporal variability, and the use
              of its proper motions in dynamical studies.  Studies of the Crab nebula and
              pulsar rely on interpreting pulsar signals that propagate through the
              interstellar medium to study issues such as the structure of the magnetic field
              structure in parts of the Galaxy, and the intrinsic properties of the pulsars
              themselves.
