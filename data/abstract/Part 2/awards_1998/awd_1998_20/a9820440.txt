CISE REU:  Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates in Dynamic Distributed Real-Time Systems

This
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports six
              students per year in programs carried out during the summers for three years. 
              The students work on projects in the area of dynamic distributed real-time
              systems including aspects of Quality of Service specification and management
              and benchmarking of such systems.  Although the students are recruited
              nationwide, the program focuses on students from minority and women's
              institutions and from institutions lacking research facilities in the southwest
              region of the country.  The student projects are related to a large, multi-year
              DARPA-funded research project.  However, in addition to their participation in
              these projects, the students will be involved in literature searching,
              technical writing and making technical presentations.
