Abstract    :
              This grant will continue support of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Site in the Physics Department of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.  Students
              will be involved in research efforts in the areas of atomic, molecular and
              optical physics, astronomy/astrophysics, condensed matter physics, and high
              pressure science.  Students will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on
              laboratory experience in laser laboratories, to analyze astronomical data on
              workstations using image analysis software, and to perform numerical
              computation and simulation using the powerful 12 GFLOP Keck Computational
              Physics Facility.  A series of group activities provides an introduction to
              research, a discussion of research ethics, a seminar in how to give a
              scientific presentation, as well as social functions.  Students will be
              recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from other colleges and universities,
              with special attention paid to selected schools ion the West and Mid-West.
