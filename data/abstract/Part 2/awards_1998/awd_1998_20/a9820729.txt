Abstract    :
              Natural light may be refracted, absorbed, or scattered by atmospheric
              constituents.  The study of these effects constitutes atmospheric optics, the
              oldest branch of theoretical meteorology.  Its early development was related to
              astronomy because of the limitations imposed by the atmosphere on distant
              seeing.  Through the years, many outstanding figures contributed to the
              subject.  In his quest for realism in painting, Leonardo da Vinci studied the
              phenomena of the rainbow and the reduction of visual contrast with range. 
              Isaac Newton gave explanations based on his experiments on refraction for the
              rainbow, and later the halo.  The celebrated scattering theory published in
              1871 by John Strutt (later Lord Rayleigh) was developed to explain the color
              and polarization of light from the clear sky.  This project continues the long
              tradition of attempting to explain why the sky looks the way it does by
              focusing on one of its most complex phenomena, twilight.  Digital photography
              and spectroradiometry are used to measure the brightness, color, and
              polarization of essentially the entire twilight sky.  The observations are
              compared with existing theoretical models based on scattering and absorption by
              atmospheric particles and gases as a way of testing the models and improving
              them.  The objective of the study is to develop accurate models for twilight
              that include the effects of scattering by molecules and background aerosols,
              absorption by ozone and other gases, and scattering and absorption by volcanic
              particles or other large aerosols that may sometimes be present.
