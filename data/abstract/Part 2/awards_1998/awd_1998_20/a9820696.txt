The Atlanta Consortium for Research in the Earth Science (ACRES)
              will conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Georgia
              State University.  The purpose of the REU program is to extend opportunities to
              participate in geoscience research in the Atlanta area.  REU program
              participants will work with ACRES faculty on selected research problems.  The
              regional geology of Georgia is both interesting and diverse.  Research projects
              will connect to the landscape in which the participants live.  While
              participants are learning to conduct research they will also be learning about
              the nature of the process of scientific investigation through readings,
              discussions and personal reflections.  The participant to faculty ratio will be
              approximately 1.4:1 ensuring extensive personal attention.  ACRES faculty come
              from a diversity of academic institutions: Georgia State University; Clark
              Atlanta University and Fort Valley State University both historically black
              colleges; Georgia Perimeter College a two year undergraduate institution; and
              Columbus State University, a four year comprehensive institution.
