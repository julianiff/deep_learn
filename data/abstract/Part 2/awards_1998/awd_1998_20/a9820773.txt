This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              project involves a small-scale, exploratory investigation of a new and
              innovative technique for soft soil stabilization.  Ion migration under electric
              fields will be used to inject charged additives in order to stabilize soils via
              cementation.  This project will demonstrate the potential use of ion migration
              to improve soil characteristics such as compressibility and shear strength. 
              Because the technique does not depend on pore fluid flow, it can be used
              effectively in soils with low hydraulic conductivity with little or no
              associated soil volume change.   

If proven out, this technique will permit
              in situ stabilization in a reasonable time period without causing large volume
              changes.  In this study, the grouting methodology will be applied to clay
              samples, and mechanical testing will be performed before and after grouting to
              assess the degree of mechanical property improvement.  The electrochemical
              properties of the soil will be evaluated and the impact of pore fluid chemistry
              and Ph on the rate of electroosmotic flow will be assessed.  This step is
              necessary in order to control electroosmotic flow during the electrochemical
              stabilization tests.  Batch tests will then be conducted without the
              application of electric fields in order to assess the effectiveness of
              additives on improving soil mechanical properties.  Finally, bench-scale tests
              will be conducted using electric fields to demonstrate the effectiveness of
              soil cementation by ion migration under electric fields.
