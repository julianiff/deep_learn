Abstract    :
              


The proposed research is to investigate the transmission impairments of
              optical fibers at high data rates due to the optical nonlinearity and the
              polarization dispersion in the fiber. The goal of the research is to use
              combined experimental and theoretical techniques to find the best system
              configuration (i.e. dispersion map, optical amplifier spacing, data format,
              etc.) to minimize the transmission impairment in high data-rate (20 to 40 Gb/s)
              WDM systems.
