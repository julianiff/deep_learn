This award to University of Michigan will provide instrumentation
              for Great Lakes research for use on R/V Laurentian, a research vessel operated
              by the Center for Great Lakes and Aquatic Sciences as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes a spare CTD underwater unit and
              associated sensors for pH, pressure and bottom location, as well as a shipboard
              sensor for measuring solar radiation and a portable winch for operating a
              side-scan sonar. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              scientists to conduct research in the Great Lakes in 1999 and future
              years.
