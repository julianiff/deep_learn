Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to conduct a workshop on the subject of "next generation
              networking." The target audience for the workshop is the "next tier" of
              institutions beyond those that NSF presently serves via its High Performance
              Connections Program. Issues for this community include: how to plan for
              advanced high performance networking, how to budget for and finance same, how
              to prepare technologically, and how to identify needs and requirements. The
              workshop will involve networking experts together with representatives from
              "next tier" institutions in analyzing these questions. A report will be
              produced for public consumption and for NSF to use in planning for future
              network infrastructure programs.
