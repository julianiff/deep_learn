Abstract    :
              Through this award, the Chemistry Division provides continued support to a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry and
              Biochemistry Department, University of Oklahoma, directed by Dr. Daniel
              Glatzhofer.  The 10 participants will be recruited from local colleges where
              vigorous research opportunities are not normally available.  The students
              select research topics from several areas of chemistry, including inorganic,
              organic, analytical, and physical chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical
              education.  At the end of the program, students present their findings in a
              written final report and at a poster session attended by interested members of
              the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department.  They may also present their work at
              a suitable American Chemical Society or comparable meeting.
