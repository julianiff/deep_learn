Abstract    :
              This grant supports the continuance of a 3-year REU Site program, which is
              dedicated to providing students with independent research experience and
              promoting career development in ecology. The program uses an effective
              administrative protocol comprising: advertisement and recruitment; selection of
              diverse and productive students; advanced preparation; individual mentorship
              within research groups comprised of faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral
              associates and undergraduate students; weekly seminars and discussion groups on
              science, careers, graduate studies, and ethics in science; field trips to
              research sites and other ecological institutions; recreational opportunities;
              an annual student symposium; program evaluation and discussion; and follow-up
              including publication, professional presentation, thesis development and career
              tracking.

The Harvard Forest is exceptionally well equipped with field,
              laboratory, and housing facilities for an REU program. A mentor supervises
              students in their independent study and a coordinator working closely with
              other Harvard Forest staff, including the Director, Administrator, Forest
              Manager, Museum Coordinator, Computer Manager and Data Manager oversees the
              program. Participants are recruited nationally with a strong emphasis on
              geographic coverage and participation of women, minorities, and students from
              small colleges. Harvard University and the Harvard Forest provide strong
              institutional commitment and support, equivalent to 100% of the total current
              request, to make this program an exceptional success.
