Abstract    :
              This project of Professor Sylvia Daunert at the University of Kentucky,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, begins with
              development of genetically engineered bacteria that are then used in optical
              sensing systems applied to problems in environmental analysis.  The bacteria
              contain reporter genes that provide light emission of specific wavelength when
              exposed to the targeted analyte.  An internal background correction system is
              developed that allows extension of the spectroscopic method to achieve low
              levels of detection.  Arrangements of bacteria-based sensors are explored for
              multianalyte sensing in flow streams and in static solutions.

Bacterial
              genes are modified such that they give off light (luminesce) when exposed to
              trace levels of targeted compounds.  For example, a water sample is analyzed by
              insertion of a sensor that contains the designed bacterial system.  The easily
              measured light output provides a rapid indication of the concentration of
              analyte.  Professor Sylvia Daunert at the University of Kentucky will study how
              to modify the bacteria so that they contain the luminescent genes, and how to
              incorporate them into sensors.
