Abstract    :
              
An electrical network consisting only of resistors has a definite response
to
              voltages applied at designated terminals.  This response can be computed 
if
              the configuration (topology) of the network and resistances of the 
resistors
              are known.  The inverse problems that will be studied are those 
in which the
              response is given and the resistances and/or topology are not 
known but
              desired.  Planar and non-planar networks will be studied.  
Relations to 
              continuous inverse problems will be investigated.  Eight 
undergraduates per
              summer will work on these problems.
