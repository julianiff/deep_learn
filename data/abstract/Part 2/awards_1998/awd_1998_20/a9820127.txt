Abstract    :
              Basili  9820127  The project will sponsor a workshop to define a research agenda
              in software research and development, responding to the President's Information
              Technology Advisory Committee's recommendations. This recent report singles out
              software as the major area in need of support if the United States is to remain
              competitive in information technology in the next century.  About 15 senior
              researchers in the areas of software engineering, systems, and applications are
              invited to a two-day workshop, October 15 and 16, 1998 to discuss the issues
              and create a formal report. Other leading software researchers who 
cannot
              attend the meeting are asked to participate by contributing their thoughts and
              reviewing the report.  The report of the workshop can serve as an aid to NSF in
              setting its own program agendas for information technology research.
