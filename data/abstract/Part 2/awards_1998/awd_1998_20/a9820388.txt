Montana State University will establish a Research Experience
              for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department. Eight undergraduate
              students will be recruited nationwide, with a recruitment focus on Native
              American students, for a two-month research experience. The students will be
              involved in physics research with emphasis in materials physics. 

The REU
              site, with an emphasis on Native American students, has potential impact on
              underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate student population in physics. 
              The research experience also includes seminars on developing communication
              skills and visits to national facilities.
