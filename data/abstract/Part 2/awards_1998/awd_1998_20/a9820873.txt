Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop that will foster interdisciplinary collaboration
              between two scientific communities -- economics and multi-agent systems.
              Multi-agent systems (MAS) researchers often rely on economic theory to develop
              concepts and design mechanisms without fully understanding or even knowing
              about the latest research in economics and game theory. By increasing
              information exchange between these communities, it is hoped that as new
              developments arise in these fields, interested researchers can more quickly
              assimilate them. In addition, by embedding the latest economic theories in
              multi-agent systems, these systems should become more robust, stable and able
              to achieve Pareto optimal outcomes.
