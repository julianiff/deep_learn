Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Phoebe K. Dea in the Department
              of Chemistry at Occidental College. The eight participants, recruited from
              community colleges, will take part in projects involving biophysical studies on
              phospholipid membranes, FT-IR analysis of proteins, kinetic studies of human
              erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase dimers, palladium-catalyzed
              allylic substitution reactions, electrochemically generated protein folding,
              bioorganic chemistry and materials chemistry .
