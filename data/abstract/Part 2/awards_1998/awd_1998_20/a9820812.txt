Abstract    :
              9820812
     This joint USA-China Workshop brings together a selected group of
              academic researchers and industrial experts from USA and China to discuss
              advanced machine tool technology. Held on the campus of the University of
              Southern California, this workshop comprises technical presentations and panel
              discussions. Topics of discussion include:  (1) innovations in dynamic data
              analysis and modeling; (2) new understandings on sensor signals such as
              acoustic emission; (3) new process dynamics understandings; (4) signal
              processing techniques including multi-rate methods; (5) parallel manufacturing
              machine structures such as hexapod and its further improvements; (6)
              reconfigurable machines and open-architecture control; (7) networking and
              information technologies, including multimedia, the Intemet-based
              communication, and multi-agent systems; (8) capabilities for high speed
              machining of hard and heretofore "unmachinable" materials; and (9) novel
              processes for rapid prototyping.   A one-day visit to Arizona State University
              and some industrial companies in the Phoenix, Arizona region is part of the
              workshop program.  The activities  arranged for the delegates from China also
              include their participation in the 1999 NSF Design and Manufacturing Grantees
              Conference, which is being held in Long Beach, California.
     Funded in part
              by China's National Science Foundation, this workshop provides a forum for the
              selected participants from the two countries to identify critical and emerging
              areas of machine tool research, to learn about the present state of machine
              tool industry, to discuss future R&D and business cooperation opportunities,
              and to establish networks useful to realization of these collaboration
              opportunities.
