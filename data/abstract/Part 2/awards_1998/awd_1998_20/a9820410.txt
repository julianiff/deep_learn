This award to Bermuda Biological Station for Research will
              provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Weatherbird
              II, a research vessel operated by BBSR as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a deck unit for use with the vessel's CTD
              (conductivity-temperature-depth) system, and a replacement for the echosounder
              used to determine ocean depth. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studiesin the western Atlantic ocean in
              1999 and future years.
