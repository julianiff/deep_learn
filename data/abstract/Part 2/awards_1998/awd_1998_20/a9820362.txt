Abstract    :
              This grant will continue support for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              Site in the Department of Physics at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell. 
              Students will be involved in research projects that cover a wide range of
              topics in the fields of nuclear physics, accelerator-based physics,
              reactor-based physics, solid-state optics, photonics and optoelectronics,
              submillimeter-wave physics, advanced materials physics, atomic physics and
              theoretical physics.  At the end of the program each student will give a
              half-hour presentation to the whole group which includes all the REU
              participants, the research advisors, and other interested members of the
              faculty.
