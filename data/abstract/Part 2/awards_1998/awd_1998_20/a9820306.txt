Abstract    :
              This grant will initiate a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the
              Physics Department of Wayne State University.  Students will be recruited
              largely from colleges in the Greater Detroit area, and will spend part of the
              academic year at Wayne State in classes and lectures on experimental physics. 
              They will then spend a summer at Cornell University participating in the REU
              Program there, as members of various research groups.
