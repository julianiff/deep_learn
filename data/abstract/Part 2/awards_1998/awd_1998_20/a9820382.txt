Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. Amy M. Shachter and John D.
              Thoburn in the Department of Chemistry at Santa Clara University.  The eight
              participants, recruited regionally, will take part in projects involving
              organic, inorganic, biological and physical chemistry.  Professional
              development will be fostered by weekly research meetings at which students will
              present and discuss their results, as well as a formal presentation at the
              final symposium.  Ethical issues in scientific work will be examined through
              weekly meetings directed by ethicists from the Santa Clara University Markkula
              Center for Applied Ethics.  This portion of the REU program is supported by the
              Science and Technology Studies, Ethics and Values Studies and Research on
              Science and Technology Program.
