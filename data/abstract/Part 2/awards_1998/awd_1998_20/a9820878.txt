Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this research project is to improve the effectiveness
              of global optimization methods by establishing a theoretical foundation for a
              class of stochastic search methods.  The conceptual framework is that of
              solving global optimization problems by stochastic emulation of distributions
              that concentrate around the global optimum.  Development of rapid sampling
              algorithms can thereby lead to efficient global optimization algorithms. These
              algorithms will be tested on three application areas:  (1) structural
              optimization; (2) shape optimization; and (3) equipment replacement under
              technological change. The approach promises to lead to an efficient algorithm
              that will render tractable problems like the three application
              areas.
Mathematical models of complex systems, in particular those arising in
              engineering applications, offer an opportunity to optimize their design and
              operation. This can be accomplished through the selection of an objective
              function and decision variables that mathematically optimize system
              performance.  Many local search algorithms exist which can find a local optimum
              for such models, but effective global search algorithms that promise to find a
              global optimum are just beginning to become available.  These global
              optimization algorithms are compromised however by an inability to be scaled up
              to solve practical large-scale optimization problems.  It is particularly
              important therefore that new algorithms be developed with a rigorous
              theoretical foundation that makes reliable predictions about their performance
              as a function of the size or scale of the problems to be solved.
