Abstract    :
              The Fairchild Tropical Garden has decided that it is necessary to computerize
              its entire (nearly 83000 specimen)herbarium collection and has begun to
              accomplish this task using a novel data entry interface, developed over the
              last year, and a dedicated group of volunteers doing the actual data entry. 
              Potential users from local land managers to taxonomists around the world have
              been adamant that a web based version with pictures of each specimen and label
              would be extremely useful to them for identification and research.  With the
              addition of a new Curator of the Herbarium the Garden now has the technical
              skills to accomplish this task.  The Garden has most of the resources that are
              needed to complete the database.  This project will support the acquisition of
              the web server itself, another digital camera to speed entry of data and
              provide partial support for a collection manager to check data and organize
              volunteers.
