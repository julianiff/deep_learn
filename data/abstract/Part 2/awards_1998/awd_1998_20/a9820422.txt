Abstract    :
              The Program and Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior (CISAB) was
              established at Indiana University in 1990 with the aid of a National Science
              Foundation Research Training Group (RTG) Grant. Over the past 8 years we have
              gathered a group of 81 faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate researchers who work
              collaboratively to combine approaches from individual disciplines in order to
              better understand animal behavior. Renewal of our REU Site Award in Animal
              Behavior would allow us to continue bringing 10 undergraduates each summer to
              Indiana University to spend 10 weeks conducting research under the direction of
              CISAB scientists. These interns are recruited primarily from groups'
              under-represented in science and from schools that cannot offer intensive
              research training. Interns have the opportunity to complete their own research
              projects, analyze and prepare their findings, and present these findings at a
              concluding symposium. In addition, interns meet regularly for: (1) a series of
              introductory faculty research presentations that introduces them to the
              research issues and diverse approaches used in the study of animal behavior,
              (2) a workshop on ethics and conduct in science; and (3) classes on mentoring
              and career issues offered in conjunction with the campus-wide Summer Research
              Opportunities Program. The central goal of this program, like all REU programs,
              is to give students an intensive research experience and an introduction to the
              conduct of science as a profession. Particular to this proposal is a second
              important goal, that of introducing students to interdisciplinary modes of
              thinking and research that will allow them to apply a variety of perspectives
              and techniques to the study of animal behavior.
