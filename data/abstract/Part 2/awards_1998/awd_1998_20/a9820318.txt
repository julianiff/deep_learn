Abstract    :
              This project will continue the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site
              Program (REU) at the University of New Mexico in conjunction with the Sevilleta
              Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER).  This project will allow eight
              undergraduate students per year for three summers (1999-2001) to work in direct
              association with the Sevilleta LTER faculty investigators. The students will
              participate in a coordinated research program that will address the
              relationships among ecosystem productivity, biodiversity, and climate
              fluctuations in the biome transition zones at the Sevilleta LTER site in
              central New Mexico.  The students will receive extensive training and
              experience in plant and animal systematics, taxonomy, and ecological
              relationships that emphasize trophic structure and ecosystem productivity. 
              Students will participate in all aspects of research, from planning new
              projects and collecting field data through computer data management and
              analysis, report preparation, and oral presentations of results.  Special
              training in Geographical Information Systems and Global Positioning Systems
              will be included in the program.  A seminar series in ecology and systematics
              (with UNM course credit) will be offered to REU participants.  Students will
              live and work together with UNM faculty, staff, and graduate students at the
              Sevilleta Field Research Station (housing cost provided by UNM).  Fall semester
              REU stipends at UNM (cost-share) will allow students to continue research
              projects into the autumn growing season in New Mexico.
