	Deep inside the earth, petroleum is formed from the
              decomposition of a macromolecular solid (kerogen) which is all that remains of
              the biological ultimate oil precursors.  The kerogen is locked in the pores of
              rocks and is usually only a few per cent of the rock.  The chemistry
              responsible for the conversion of kerogen to petroleum is not understood. 
              There are indications that it may involve catalysis by some of the minerals
              present and may also involve reactions with the water present.  We will
              determine whether some of the best mineral mater catalyst candidates can bring
              about petroleum forming reactions between kerogens and water.  Positive results
              would not only aid in petroleum exploration and in understanding the carbon
              cycle, but might open new processing and upgrading possibilities for heavy
              oils.
