Description: This project supports a collaboration between Dr.
              Xiangdong Ji, Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College park,
              Maryland and Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, Department of Physics, Quaid-i-Azam
              University, Islamabad, Pakistan.  The two plan to conduct investigations into
              hadron substructure and quantum chronodynamics (QCD).  They will focus on QCD,
              the fundamental theory of strong interactions, which determines the structure
              and properties of hadrons and nuclei.  Specifically they will investigate five
              particular topics: conformal symmetry and high energy scattering, orbital
              parton motion and nucleon spin structure, transversely-polarized vector meson
              production and quark helicity-flip off-forward distributions, and the QCD
              pomeron, low-x physics and diffraction, and quantum computing. 

Scope: This
              project is for support of a potentially important research in nucleon
              structure, with significant indirect educational benefits. The US PI is a
              world-class expert who has done pioneering work in this area.  Dr. Hoodbhoy is
              considered the leading expert in Pakistan in this field.  He has contributed to
              research in this area in joint work at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology.  This project is expected to result in significant joint scientific
              publications.  The proposal meets INT objective of supporting mutually
              beneficial international collaboration.  This project is being funded jointly
              by the Division of International Programs and by the Physics Division.
