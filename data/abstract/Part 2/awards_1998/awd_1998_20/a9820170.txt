The proposed research will advance techniques for real time
              analysis of thin film nucleation  and growth. Powerful high-speed optical
              probes  based on polarimetry will be developed to enable full characterization
              of the polarization state of light reflected from the surfaces of growing films
              with sub-monolayer resolution. The new methods will yield 1) the Stokes vector
              of the reflected light beam from 1.5 to 6.5 eV in 32 msec, or 2) the 16
              elements of the Mueller matrix of the sample over a similar energy range in
              approximately 200 msec.  With such capabilities, a better understanding of the
              growth of silicon and  boron nitride thin films will be possible,  particularly
              throughout the technologically important deposition regimes in which the
              morphology or crystalline phase of the films evolves with thickness leading to
              anisotropy and depolarization effects. These methods  will guide the
              fabrication of new and improved thin film materials for use in future
              generation of large area electronics and hard coatings.   Technology transfer
              of the process of materials preparation is expected to lead in improvements in
              silicon thin film voltaics and boron nitride hard coatings technologies.  The
              proposed research will serve to train graduate and undergraduate students  with
              broad skills in condensed matter, materials, and optical physics that are in
              demand for post-graduate employment in industrial research and development
              laboratories.

In this project the principal investigator will develop new
              techniques for the preparation of improved thin films during their growth on a
              variety of substrates.  The new methods will be transferable to U.S. industries
              engaged in the commercial production of thin films for a variety of
              technological applications.  The research will engage graduate and
              undergraduate students who will be trained in methods and techniques which will
              be important in U.S. technology in the 21st Century
