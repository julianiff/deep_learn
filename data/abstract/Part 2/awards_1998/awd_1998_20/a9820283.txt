Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. Lon B. Knight and Moses Lee in the
              Department of Chemistry at Furman University.   The twelve undergraduate
              participants, including nine Furman and three non-Furman students, will be
              joined by twenty additional students and three visiting faculty members from
              small schools.  The NSF-REU students will select research projects from twelve
              different areas including the study of new radical cations, use of capillary
              electrophoresis to estimate solute hydrophobicity, detection and
              characterization of single DNA molecules, kinetics of oxidations in
              supercritical water, synthesis and characterization of surface-immobilized
              metal complexes, characterization agents of carbon surfaces by adsorption
              measurements, synthesis of sequence-specific DNA binding agents, design and
              synthesis of nanoporous solids, preparation of inhibitors for the enzyme
              aromatase, synthesis and characterization of thin-film precursors, new
              approaches in capillary electrophoresis and the photochemistry of transition
              metal complexes bound to DNA.
