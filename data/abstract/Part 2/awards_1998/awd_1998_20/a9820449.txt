Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Lorraine M. Deck and four
              co-principal investigators in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              New Mexico (UNM).  The ten participants, recruited regionally and from UNM,
              will take part in a  program that offers an intensive and comprehensive
              research experience.  The conclusion of the research experience will include a
              final seminar, a scientifically written research report and a poster. The
              opportunity will also be afforded for students to participate in the writing of
              a paper for publication and/or travel to a professional meeting to make a
              presentation.
