Abstract    :
              This project is supported under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              Program. It is designed to provide undergraduates with a unique opportunity to
              participate in field measurements under the direction of faculty who are part
              of a teem of atmospheric scientists (chemists, physicists and meteorologists).
              The 8-week research experience takes place coincident with summer measurement
              intensives during which students live in-residence with other students and
              faculty at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) and work at the
              sampling tower and laboratory constructed through the Program for Research on
              Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions and Transport (PROPHET). Students assist
              with the integration of instruments and inlet sampling systems and conduct
              on-site measurements of gas- and particulate-phase chemical species mixing
              ratios and/or fluxes and meteorological parameters. Each student is provided
              with training that allows them to take responsibility for the measurement of
              one or more chemical species or meteorological parameters or for the
              application of models to generate back trajectories or chemical species
              distributions. In addition to their hands-on, in-depth exposure to their
              specific measurement or modeling technique, they gain an overall understanding
              of related measurements and modeling activities and an appreciation for the
              significance of their own and their peers' efforts towards the achievement of
              the science team's research objectives. Ml team members live at the UMBS, share
              meals, and attend weekly data meetings to evaluate findings and measurement
              strategies
