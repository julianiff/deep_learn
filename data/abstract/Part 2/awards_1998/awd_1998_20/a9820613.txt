Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Geography sponsored by Oklahoma
              State University.  Eight undergraduate students will be recruited nationally to
              perform research under the guidance of eight faculty mentors.  The projects
              will deal with using geographical information systems (GIS) in research in
              hydrology and water resources.  The projects will be parts or collaborations
              with on-going research of the faculty mentors.  The students ill be given
              ArcView Certification, GPS training, metadata instruction, and participate in
              mentor/peer seminars.  Finally each undergraduate researcher will have an
              opportunity to present the findings of his/her research at a professional
              meeting.  Field trips will provide the students training in ground truthing and
              a chance to practice field data collection relevant to their research project. 
              

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
              talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
              experiences.
