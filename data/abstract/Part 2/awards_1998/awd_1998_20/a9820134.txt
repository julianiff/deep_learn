Professor Eric
              McFarland will investigate the nature of chemo-electric phenomena originating
              when atoms or molecules interact with very thin metal films deposited on
              semiconductors.  The research will yield a test of the hypothesis that
              collision and adsorption of hydrogen (or deuterium) on Ag and Cu films on
              Si(111) leads to the generation of excited electrons by direct energy transfer.
               On this basis, Prof. McFarland will explore the concept of new hydrogen
              sensors.  Additionally, the study will be extended and the concept will be
              tested with the adsorption and reaction of other gases, including O2, CO, CO2,
              NO2, C2H2, etc., at various temperatures as a function of the characteristics
              of the metal-semiconductor substrate.  The electronic excitation produced by
              chemisorption and reaction will be validated and employed as a basis for new
              solid state gas sensors.  The project will involve students and two
              collaborators, Profs. Arunava Majumdar and Henry Weinberg.   UCSB will
              cost-share the equipment.
