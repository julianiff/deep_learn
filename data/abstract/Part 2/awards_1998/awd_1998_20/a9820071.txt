Description: This award is to support a US scientific
              delegation to a US-Turkey Workshop on Mechatronics, to be held in Istanbul,
              Turkey, May 24 to 26, 1999.  The workshop will be held in association with the
              Second International Mechatronics Conference.  The Principal Investigator is
              Professor Sabri Tosunoglu, of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at
              Florida International University.  The Turkish co-organizer is Dr. Okyay
              Kaynak, Professor and Chairman, Department of Electrical Engineering at
              Bosphorus University in Istanbul.  The objectives of the workshop and
              conference are to disseminate the recent advances in this area, provide a forum
              to actively seek cooperation between the participants and their institutions,
              and to discuss future research directions, and especially to identify
              opportunities for collaboration by US and Turkish scientists.  The topics to be
              covered will include: mechatronics design, distributed systems, vision and
              sensors, robots and mobile machines, vibration and control, computational
              intelligence in mechatronics, embedded real-time systems, micro mechatronics,
              motion control, hardware/software co-design, intelligent manufacturing systems,
              and education and training in mechatronics.

Scope:  This project will bring
              together 10 well known American scientists, from different institutions, who
              are experts in various topics in the fields of mechanics and electronics with
              their counterparts in Turkey to identify areas for joint research.  This
              meeting will also enable the US scientists to interact with scientists from
              European countries and from other countries and to attend informative
              presentations about this important field exploring the advances made in
              computer and electronics technologies.  The Turkish organizer, Dr. Kaynak, is
              the UNESCO Mechatronics Chair at Bosphorus University, and is a well-known
              authority in this field.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting
              joint binational workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas
              of mutual interest.
