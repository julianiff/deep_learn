Coupling Deformable Model and Pixel
              Affinity Methods for Medical Image Segmentation and 3D Organ
              Reconstruction

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing
              award. This research develops new and efficient methods for segmenting
              radiological data of internal organs and reconstructing their 3D shape, to
              improve clinical practice and medical
education.  These new methods allow the
              inclusion of image features such as patterns, textures and contours, to the
              storage and retrieval of data from the patient databases of the future.  The
              methods we develop do not depend on the imaging modality used and can
be used
              for any type of internal organ. However, given the focus of our current
              research, we segment primarily the lungs and the heart and secondarily the
              brain.  Such data are routinely used at the University of Pennsylvania. In
              particular we develop 1) methods for detecting and segmenting the boundaries of
              internal organs, 2) methods for detecting
abnormalities in the form of
              lesions, such as cancers and infections, 3) appropriate user interfaces so that
              the segmentation results can be superimposed on the radiological image, 4) 3D
              reconstructions of the shape of the internal organs using deformable models and
              splines, 5) the necessary evaluation procedures to test the accuracy of the
              segmentation methods and the efficacy of the user interface.
