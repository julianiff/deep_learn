Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. Randolph S. Duran and Michael Scott
              in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida.  The ten
              participants, recruited nationally, will take part in projects involving a bio-
              and materials Chemistry research focus.  The undergraduates will have the
              unique opportunity of interacting  with ten French undergraduates who are
              present as part of a broader REU effort in the department.  In addition,
              interactions with students from the Engineering Center for Particle Science and
              Technology (ERC) in Gainesville and the Center for Research and Education in
              Optics and Lasers (CREOL) in Orlando will be arranged.  Student research
              findings are summarized in a journal-style report and the participants are
              encouraged to present their work verbally during the course of the program and,
              later, at the Florida Section meeting of the American Chemical Society.
