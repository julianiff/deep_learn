SURFing the Manufacturing Engineering Lab (MEL) is proposed as a
              NIST-NSF partnership to encourage outstanding students by providing research
              opportunities with internationally known NIST scientists in the fields of
              intelligent systems, automated production, precision engineering, and
              manufacturing systems integration.  Given the significant lack of diversity
              among the manufacturing scientists, this program will actively seek out
              competitive students from under-represented groups.  In addition, outstanding
              students from undergraduate 'institutions, who would otherwise be limited in
              their exposure to resource-intensive scientific research, will be actively
              sought.  The selected students (approximately 8) will spend 10- 12 weeks
              working one-on-one with NIST staff on selected projects that combine basic
              research with direct applications to problems of national importance.  Students
              and advisors will be paired according to background and mutual interests.  The
              impetus and templates for this proposed program are the highly successful
              SURFing the Physics Lab program, which began at NIST 'in 1993 and was recently
              renewed through summer 2001 (PHY-9322801), and the SURFing the Materials
              Science and Engineering Lab (MSEL) (DMR9732098).  Although applications and
              finances for the MEL, MSEL, and Physics SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research
              Fellowship) students will be handled separately, other aspects will be combined
              into a single program as much as possible.  For example, there is now a
              half-time person assigned to do all of the administrative work for the NIST
              SURF programs.  Housing arrangements will be made for all students in a nearby
              furnished apartment complex, and all students will participate in the many NIST
              seminars and in the weekly student-run summer seminar series.  All NIST SURF
              students will give oral presentations describing their research in a combined
              symposium at the end of the internship.  SURF students will be encouraged to
              participate 'in a scientific conference.  As in the Physics program, the
              participating schools will be asked to share costs (typically 10-20%).
