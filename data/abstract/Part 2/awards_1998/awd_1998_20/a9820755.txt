Abstract    :
              The four main objectives of this project supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program, and carried out by Professor Brodbelt of the University of
              Texas at Austin are 1) the measurement of binding affinities in host guest
              systems through comparison of the intensities of appropriate ions in the
              electrospray ionization mass spectrum, 2) determination of the influence of
              solvent effects and other solution conditions on binding selectivities, again
              as evidenced by ion intensities in the mass spectrum, 3) measurement of binding
              affinities for synthetic host ligands (work done in collaboration with other
              research groups that will prepare these new analogs) and 4)use of gas phase
              hydrogen and deuterium exchange reactions for probing the structures of the
              host guest complexes. All of the mass spectra will be recorded with an
              electrospray ionization source linked to an ion trap mass spectrometer.
              

This project uses electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to rapidly and
              accurately determine the strengths of binding between guest ions and host
              molecules, including new host molecules synthesized by organic chemistry
              groups.  The telling advantage of this work is that the relative binding
              strengths can be assessed directly from the relative intensities of the ions in
              the mass spectrum.  Of the graduate students involved in this work, a sizable
              fraction are comprised of women or underrepresented groups.
