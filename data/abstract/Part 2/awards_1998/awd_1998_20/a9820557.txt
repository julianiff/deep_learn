Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Drs. Victoria J. Geisler and Andrew J.
              Leavitt in the Department of Chemistry at West Georgia  College.  The seven
              participants, recruited from two-year institutions in the Southeast, will take
              part in research projects from areas that include analytical, biological,
              inorganic, organic and physical chemistry.  In addition to research activities,
              the goals of the program are to familiarize participants with scientific
              literature and literacy, to promote good communication and writing skills and
              to increase the pool of students, particularly women and minority, who go on
              for graduate training in chemistry.
