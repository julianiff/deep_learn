Abstract    :
              The SMALL Undergraduate Research Project is a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates site funded by the National Science Foundation.  Students
              admitted into the program will work in groups of 2-4 with faculty on original
              research in mathematics.  Each group will have a single faculty advisor.  For
              1999, we are currently planning on five groups, probably in the areas of knot
              theory, immiscible fluids and geodesic nets, ergodic theory, commutative
              algebra and vector-valued forms.

The students will prove theorems, publish
              papers and give talks on their work at undergraduate conferences and at
              research conferences.  In 1999, all students will attend Mathfest, in
              Providence, RI at the end of July to talk on their work.

The students will
              reside on campus at Williams for nine weks of the summer, for each of the next
              five summers.  The total number of students funded by this grant is 8 for each
              of the next three summers and then 15 for the last two summers.  The total
              number of students in the program will be at least this many, with the number
              of additonal students depending on other sources of funds.
