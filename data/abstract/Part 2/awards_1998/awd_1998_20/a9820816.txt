This award supports research in theoretical modeling of
              patterns and disorder in nonequilibrium condensed matter materials.  The PI
              proposes to concentrate the project in the areas of polytypism, polyamorphism
              in two-dimensional simple fluids, and electrostatic mechanisms for
              two-dimensional chiral symmetry breaking during growth.   The study of
              polytypism will focus on applying ideas from the theory of language and
              automata to the analysis of experimentally observed structures in a range of
              layered materials.  The study of polyamorphism will continue current work that
              revealed the existence of hexatic and isotropic types of structural glasses in
              these systems.  The third project is motivated by the recent experimental
              observations of novel two-dimensional chiral growth forms in thin films of TCNQ
              and TCNQ+C60.

This award supports theoretical research in disorder and
              patterns in materials away from equilibrium.  The project is constructed in
              three main thrust areas.  In the first the PI will apply developments in
              mathematical models of one-dimensional, discrete systems to analyze the
              experimental diffraction measurements of layered materials.  Potential systems
              of applicability include a range of materials with layered structures from
              superconducting materials to minerals such as mica and clays.  The other topics
              will study model glassy phases in materials of reduced dimensionality and
              growth mechanisms of materials in systems with reduced dimensionality.
