Abstract    :
              The Department of Bacteriology and the Graduate School of the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison will provide opportunities for summer research projects for
              undergraduate students in microbiology, molecular biology, and related fields.
              Extra effort will be made to recruit qualified students that are women,
              minority or disabled, or who otherwise have limited opportunities to conduct
              laboratory research at their home institution. The main goal of the program is
              to attract and stimulate motivated students to pursue careers in research,
              while providing them with hands-on experience. The Department of Bacteriology
              has an internationally recognized research faculty, committed to both
              undergraduate and graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory
              research projects. Students will work as part of a dynamic research team
              investigating a basic problem in cellular or molecular biology. Students will
              become familiar with the research techniques of microbiology, biochemistry,
              genetics and molecular biology using modern equipment and facilities in the
              Department of Bacteriology. Students will attend professional seminars and make
              written and oral presentations of their own research findings. The Department
              has an established record of providing research opportunities for undergraduate
              students and has successfully administered summer REU Programs for students
              since 1988. The Department will fund ten students per year for a nine-week
              intensive research experience.
