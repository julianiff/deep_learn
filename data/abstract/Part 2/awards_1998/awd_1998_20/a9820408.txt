Dartmouth College establishes a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site with a focus on molecular materials. Ten
              undergraduate students are recruited per year, nationwide, for a ten-week
              summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              institutions with limited research opportunities.

Students are involved in
              molecular materials research that includes thin film chemistry, assembly of
              macromolecular arrays, synthesis and characterization of nanoparticle thin
              films, theory of polymer blends, and scanning microscopy techniques.  In
              addition, students participate in weekly seminars, field trips to research
              laboratories and facilities, and social activities.  The program on molecular
              materials offers undergraduate students research opportunities in an area of
              novel materials that cuts across the boundaries of traditional disciplines.
