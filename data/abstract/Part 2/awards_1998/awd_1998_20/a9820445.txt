Vanderbilt University offers undergraduate research
              opportunities through a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in
              its Physics department. Eight undergraduate students are recruited every year
              nationwide for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus
              on undergraduates from underrepresented groups. 

Students work on research
              projects in the areas of condensed matter and materials physics, non-linear
              optical physics, biophysics, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics.  In
              addition, students participate in tutorials related to technical research
              issues and career workshops, and attend weekly research group meetings, field
              trips to regional research facilities and social activities.
