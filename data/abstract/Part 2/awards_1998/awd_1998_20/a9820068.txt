This project will support a conference for the state
              coordinators of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and
              Science Teaching (PAEMST) Program.  These coordinators have high rates of
              turnover, and need an update on the processes and policies of operating the
              PAEMST Program at the state level.  The conference will provide opportunities
              to share strategies (increasing the minority applicant pool, state recognition
              events, e.g.) and will offer small grants to up to five states that are willing
              to implement new approaches.
