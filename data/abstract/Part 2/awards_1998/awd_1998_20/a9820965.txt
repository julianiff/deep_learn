This project will conduct a combination
              of theoretical and practical explorations of algorithms for graph theoretic
              problems in graph connectivity, facility location, distance preserving
              subgraphs, multimedia storage and data broadcast.   Emphasis will be on good
              approximations for NP-hard problems for problems in optimization.  Particular
              emphasis will be on greedy methods and heuristics for algorithms.
