Dr. Metzger
              will study the large scale structure of the Milky Way's disk using distant
              Cepheid stars as tracers of the disk's rotation, shape, and scale.  His survey,
              made at 2.2 microns in the near infrared, avoids the heavy extinction by dust
              that limits optical surveys and permits the detection of stars at large
              distances.  Multiple sampling permits the detection of variable stars, such as
              Cepheids, whose distances can be accurately determined.   These, coupled with
              the measurement of stellar velocities, from spectroscopy, will be used to
              develop large scale models of disk kinematics.  Much of the survey is complete,
              and Dr. Metzger will continue with the full, streamlined analysis of the entire
              data set to produce a catalog of stars in the Galactic plane and their
              variability at 2.2 microns.  The catalog will become the basis for selection of
              candidate variable stars as targets for follow-up photometry and spectroscopy
              from which kinematic models will be derived to study issues of distance scales,
              spiral arm kinematics, and the overall shape of the galactic potential.
