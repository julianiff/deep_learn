The University of Arizona offers a summer research
              experience for undergraduate students through a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  This REU site utilizes electron microscopy and
              other microanalytical tools as common focus of several research projects that
              include studies of the structure of ceramic films, sol-gels for nuclear waste
              encapsulation, hydrogels for artificial joints and defects in
              silicon-on-insulator structures.  Eight undergraduate students are recruited
              every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus
              on undergraduates from underrepresented groups.  In addition to participating
              in individual research projects, REU students take a one-week course on
              electron microscopy and microanalysis and attend weekly research group
              meetings.

This REU site also emphasizes the recruitment of undergraduate
              students early in their college years, at the freshman and sophomore level,
              thus offering them a research experience before career plans are already set.
