Dr. Paczynski and
              collaborators will continue and expand the very successful Optical
              Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to monitor millions of stars towards
              the Galactic Bulge and the Magellanic Clouds, with the goal of detecting and
              analyzing gravitational microlensing events.  The collaborative project
              involves astronomers at the Warsaw University Observatory and their 1.3-meter
              telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  They will upgrade the CCD
              camera to install an 8K x 8K mosaic and will implement image subtraction
              software in the data flow.  These improvements will increase the data rate, and
              microlensing detections, by an order of magnitude, to more than 500 events per
              year, and increase the accuracy of the photometry by a factor of at least two. 
              The OGLE project uses standard BVI photometric bandpasses, and yields vast
              numbers of variable stars which can be analyzed for a variety of astrophysical
              projects.  Of particular interest are issues in galactic structure and stellar
              populations such as a determination of the optical depth to microlensing events
              to verify models of the mass distribution in the inner galaxy, and the
              calibration of the extragalactic distance scale.  The OGLE project makes data
              available to the public as soon as is practically feasible, to maximize the
              science to come from the survey by themselves and others.
