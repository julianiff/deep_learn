Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project is to develop methods for characterizing
              near-fault ground motion for use in engineering design and evaluation.  The
              specific issues to be addressed include near-fault rupture directivity effects
              and basin edge effects.  These two effects have been identified as principal
              causes of the damaging ground motions in the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe
              earthquakes.  This project involves a collaboration with Professor Irikura of
              Kyoto University and colleagues from several other Japanese research
              organizations, with whom the Principal Investigators have a long term
              collaborative relationship.

Specific objectives include: (1) develop
              improved procedures for earthquake source characterization for use in the
              prediction of near-fault strong ground motion of future earthquakes; (2)
              develop improved procedures for simulating near-fault ground motions, including
              the effects of complex structure such as subsurface bedrock topography that
              cause basin edge effects; develop an improved representation of near-fault
              ground motion for use in engineering analysis and design, using time domain
              characteristics in conjunction with spectral characteristics.  The last task
              involves collaboration with Professor Helmut Krawinkler of Stanford
              University.

It is expected that this research will lead to: (1) reliable
              procedures, having a sound theoretical and empirical basis, for the generation
              of near-fault ground motions for use in practical design and evaluation; (2) an
              improved set of ground motion parameters with which to describe near-fault
              ground motions; and (3) an improved representation of near-fault ground
              motions; using sets of near-fault ground motion time histories and simplified
              near-fault pulses, for use in design.
