Abstract    :
              People have considerable experience using 3D graphics in scientific
              visualization, but very little understanding of exactly what aspects of those
              3D graphics give us the most perceptual benefit.   As a consequence, we do not
              understand how to optimize and improve our use of this tool.   In this project,
              the PIs will perform human-subject tests to test the effectiveness of various
              depth cues on the perception of 3D scenes, and to quantify the difference in
              effectiveness between perceptual depth cues in synthetic scenes and in "real"
              scenes as presented by physical models.  The findings will have significant
              implications for interactive computer graphics and scientific visualization in
              general, and for virtual reality in particular, where much effort and money are
              being invested to generate realistic synthetic scenes without any rigorous
              scientific knowledge of what the most convincing realistic-scene cues really
              are.   This project should supply some of the answers.
