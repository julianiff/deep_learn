Abstract    :
              The Summer Student Program is an 11-week research apprenticeship program in
              which students will conduct independent, basic research in mammalian genetics
              in the laboratory of a Jackson Laboratory scientist. Ten undergraduate
              students, selected from a nationwide pool of 250 applications, undertake and
              learn the fundamental steps in the practice of scientific research: How to ask
              a biological question; how to make and test an hypothesis; how to form a
              defensible interpretation of data; how to communicate results orally and in
              writing; and how to receive feedback and incorporate it into forward thinking.
              The overall theme is to expose the students to the professional life and habits
              of mind of a scientist.
Each student's research will focus on one or more of
              the following areas: Cancer; Computational Biology/Bioinformatics;
              Developmental Biology and Aging; Genomics; Immunology/Hematology; Metabolic
              Diseases; Neurobiology and Sensory Deficits. Their mentors are members of the
              Laboratory's Research Staff, consisting of 37 scientists conducting full-time
              investigator-initiated research. The students devote most of their effort to
              their individual research projects, but the program also provides formal
              exposure to the breadth of genetics research at the Laboratory, to different
              paths leading to careers in science, and about the ethical conduct of
              research.
