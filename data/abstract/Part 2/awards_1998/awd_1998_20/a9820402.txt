Abstract    :
              The ten week summer research program in Physics and Astronomy at the University
              of Oklahoma will be continued, to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to
              participate in substantial scientific research in one of four areas:
              astrophysics, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics or high energy
              physics.  Ten external students will be funded by the REU site grant and five
              to seven OU and native Oklahoman students will be funded by the University and
              the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education each year.  The goal of the
              program is to encourage and prepare students to seek further educational and
              career opportunities in physics and astronomy.
External students will be
              recruited nationally with emphasis on underrepresented groups and participants
              who otherwise lack opportunities for research experience.  They will be matched
              with individual research mentors in their stated area of interest.  Students
              will present their results at regional SPS and APS conferences.  The program
              will build upon the previous success in introducing students of diverse
              backgrounds to modern research in an engaging setting.
