Abstract    :
              Abstract:  This award provides partial travel support and local 
expenses for
              the 20 invited speakers at the conference on 
"Application of Heavy Tailed
              Distributions in Economics, Engineering 
and Statistics" on June 3-5, 1999 in
              the Ward Circle Building at 
the American University in Washington, D.C.
              Although heavy tailed 
distributions are increasingly being used to model
              phenomena in 
a wide range of applications in economics, finance, signal
              
processing, telecommunication network analysis, time series, 
physical and
              biological provblems, progress in this area has been 
limited by the lack of
              efficient and reliable methods of modeling, 
analyzing and predicting for such
              models.  In the past decade, 
there has been significant progress in both the
              theory and methods 
of working with non-Gaussian models.  This conference will
              bring 
together many of the top theoreticians and practitioners,
national and
              interenational, working in the field of heavy-tailed, 
non-Gaussian models and
              those with experience with massive 
data sets.  The invited list of speakers
              includes four women.  
Support for graduate students and young investigators
              is provided 
with reduced registration fees.
