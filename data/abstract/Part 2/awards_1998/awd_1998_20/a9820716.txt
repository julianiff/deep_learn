	This project examines variations in cultural behavior
              involved in the use of a new medical tool, ultrasound diagnosis of fetal
              anomaly.  The researchers, two cultural anthropologists, will study how
              culturally specific understandings of normality, risk, and personal
              responsibility are expressed through the diagnosis of fetal anomaly by
              ultrasound imaging, and will explain the variation between practices in Greece
              and in Canada by variations in cultural understandings.  The project will test
              hypotheses about differences in concepts about medical authority and morality
              which affect doctor-patient interaction; about how culturally specific meanings
              of the "normal body" result in differences between Greek and Canadian couples'
              experiences and causal explanations of fetal anomaly; and about variations in
              the cultural definition of risk.  The methods used will be participant
              observation in hospitals and clinics in Athens, Greece and in Victoria,
              Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, as well as interviews with pregnant women and
              their partners who have had experience with fetal anomaly; interviews with
              health practitioners, and archival research.
	This research will advance
              theory about the relationship between conceptions of the "normal" body and
              cultural context, relating norms of the appropriate or ideal body to
              historically specific social and political orders.  The project will also
              contribute to the understanding of cross-cultural specifics of biomedical and
              bioethical beliefs and practices.
