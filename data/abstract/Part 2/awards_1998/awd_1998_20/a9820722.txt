Drs. Thaddeus and
              Gottlieb will continue a program of laboratory and radio astronomical research
              on reactive molecules in the interstellar gas and in circumstellar shells.  The
              research will emphasize Fourier Transform Microwave (FTM) spectroscopy and
              radio astronomical identifications of molecular ions and highly reactive
              neutral organic molecules.  The FTM technique is the ideal means for
              establishing the existence of new molecules in the laboratory and for
              determining their abundances.  It will provide crucial data for an independent
              search in the laboratory for the carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands. 
              Their goal is to measure radio line frequencies of both neutral species, and
              also of negative and positive ions, to guide radio astronomical observations of
              the diffuse gas.  Their determination of structures in key ions will allow the
              assessment of specific ion-molecule reactions in dense clouds, and provide
              important information on the overall chemical scheme in translucent clouds,
              elucidating the link between diffuse and dense interstellar clouds.  They will
              also continue work toward increasing the sensitivity of the spectrometer.
