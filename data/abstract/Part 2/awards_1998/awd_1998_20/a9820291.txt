Robust, Scalable Language Generation Using
              Symbolic and Statistical Techniques

	This is a three-year continuing award. 
              Natural language processing comprises both language analysis (text in) and
              language generation (text out).  While many applications need both
              capabilities, the bulk of research and development has so far been on the
              former.  As a result, weaknesses in many practical systems (e.g., translation,
              explanation, dialogue) are traceable to classic problems in natural language
              generation (NLG).  New statistical techniques have made it possible to address
              classic problems through the extraction of knowledge automatically from online
              text corpora, but so far these techniques have been applied primarily to
              language analysis, and not to NLG.  For example, word-sense disambiguation
              (word to concept) has been the object of intense recent study, while lexical
              selection (concept to word) has languished, relatively speaking.  A similar
              discrepancy exists between sentence parsing (analysis) and sentence structuring
              (generation).  While trainable parsers can now operate on unrestricted text,
              NLG usually requires perfect inputs and relies on handcrafted, domain-specific
              knowledge.  We believe that statistical methods have the potential to improve
              NLG technology in the near term, to enable new applications, and to open up new
              research problems.  Our research will emphasize accuracy, scalability,
              robustness, and evaluation; it will combine hand-built grammar, online lexical
              resources, and novel "learning by reading" approaches for gathering knowledge
              automatically from online texts.
