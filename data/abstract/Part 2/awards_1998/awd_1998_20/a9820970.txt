This Americas award will support a visit to Mexico for Drs
              Oscar Garcia and Ardeshir Goshtasby, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, to
              plan a collaborative research proposal in the areas of computer graphics,
              computer vision, and human-computer interaction, with Dr. Issac J. Rudomin,
              Centro de Tecnologia de la Informacion of ITESM-CEM in Mexico City.

Topics
              for discussion during the proposed visit will include simulation of visually
              detectable features in the production of speech, analysis (recognition) and
              synthesis (production), and potential experiments to address questions on major
              aspects of human-computer interaction.
