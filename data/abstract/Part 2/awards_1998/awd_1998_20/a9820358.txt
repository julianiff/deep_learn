A NSF-REU site will be initiated in the Department of
              Physics and Electronics at the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao (UPRH). 
              Thirty undergraduate physics students (in a three-year period, 1999-2001)
              coming from the continental United States and Puerto Rico will participate in a
              variety of on-going theoretical and experimental research projects.  Six
              experienced physics faculty members from the Physics and Electronics department
              at UPRH are involved in this initiative.  Each will supervise, mentor and work
              one-on-one with participating students.  For three consecutive years the
              NSF-REU site will operate during an eight-week period in the summer and will
              continue for students with residence in Puerto Rico into the academic year. 
              This program offers to Hispanic-American physics students the opportunity to
              engage in research projects under the guidance of a Hispanic-American faculty
              professor.  Weekly seminars and "hands-on" mini-workshops are planned to
              address basic computational and research techniques, such as numerical and
              symbolic programming, data acquisition, instrumental control, and web
              technology.  Participation in this program by women and minority students will
              be particularly encouraged.

The Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site Program provides research experience for undergraduate students. 
              The aim of the National Science Foundation is to promote and advance scientific
              and engineering progress in the United States.  This requires continued efforts
              to attract a diversified pool of talented students into research careers in
              these fields and to help ensure that they receive the best education
              possible.
