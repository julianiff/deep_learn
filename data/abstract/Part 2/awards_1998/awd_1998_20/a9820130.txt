This is one component of a group proposal among four PIs
              from four institutions requesting funds to integrate, quality-control,
              disseminate, and begin the interpretation of the global Tritium/Helium isotope
              data set collected by four US laboratories during the WOCE (World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Program.  PIs plan to coordinate with a
              similar project proposed by the corresponding European groups, and will also
              collaborate with other tracer programs, such as the recently-funded team
              analyzing ChlorofluoroCarbons (CFC). The main goal of the project is to make an
              integrated, quality-controlled data set available to the oceanographic
              community for use in the AIMS phase of WOCE (AIMS = Analysis, Interpretation,
              Modeling, and Synthesis).  Less explicitly, the PIs propose to summarize the
              He/Tr isotope fields in a set of manuscripts, written in common format and
              containing technical information on the production of the data sets, as well as
              scientific discussion of the main features of the fields. These would be
              followed by the identification of scientific issues to be addressed
              collaboratively with other WOCE investigators.  This particular project will
              have the lead in overseeing quality control, maintain the website for
              dissemination of the data, and take the lead in ensuring coordination among the
              PIs.
