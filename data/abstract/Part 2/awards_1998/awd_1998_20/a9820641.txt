Dr. Crutcher
              continues his observational study of interstellar magnetic fields.  He will
              measure magnetic field strengths and morphologies in star-forming regions in
              the Galaxy to provide observational constraints and testing of theoretical
              models in order to improve understanding of the processes of star formation. He
              will utilize a variety of radio telescopes to measure the Zeeman effect in
              selected spectral lines and the linear polarization of dust emission and
              spectral line emission to yield field strengths as well as field morphologies.
              His comprehensive observational research program is an important complement to
              theoretical studies of the evolution of the interstellar plasma and of the star
              formation process.
