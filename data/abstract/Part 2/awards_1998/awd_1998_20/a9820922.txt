Abstract    :
              The Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS) was
              established as an institution aimed at recent or expectant Ph.D. recipients on
              the threshold of independent research careers in atmospheric chemistry. This
              will be the fifth in a series of Colloquia designed to introduce these young
              scientists and their thesis and/or post doctoral research to one another and to
              representatives of the major funding agencies involved in atmospheric chemistry
              and closely related topics. ACCESS V will be held at Narangassett, RI, June
              10-12, 1999, immediately prior to the 1999 Gordon Research Conference on
              Atmospheric Chemistry in Newport, RI. The colloquium attendants will
              participate in the Gordon conference.
