Abstract

In this study we will
              survey the function words (grammatical  words like articles, conjunctions,
              auxiliary verbs, pronouns,  prepositions etc.) in a corpus of naturally
              occurring American English speech which  has been labelled both phonetically
              and prosodically, and  inventory the way the pronunciation of these words
              varies in  normal speech.  This will allow us to test the hypothesis that the 
              phonetic variation of these words is influenced by prosodic  structure such as
              intonational phrasing and pitch accenting.

Function words are particularly
              prone to phonetic modification  compared with content words like nouns, verbs
              and adjectives;  see for example ``doncha'' for ``don't you'', ``givem'' for
              ``give  him'', and ``mishu'' for ``miss you''.  Although these changes  may not
              seem systematic, we believe they can be described by a  relative small number
              of rules applied to just a few  representational structures.  For example,
              results of a pilot study  of the function word ``to'' suggest that its
              modifications are  strongly influenced by the distinctive features of the
              preceding  context, the form class of the function word, and the prosody of 
              the spoken utterance. A better understanding of what can  happen to function
              words in running speech will result in  improved linguistic theories, cognitive
              processing models and  techniques for automatic speech recognition and
              synthesis.
