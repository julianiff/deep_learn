This project is a study of the
              inherent connections between worst case and average case complexity theory and
              applications of understanding these connections to the design of secure
              public-key cryptosystems based on assumptions of hardness in the worst case.  
              The goals of this project are to investigate this worst case / avaerage case
              connection in a broad sense, to refine the currently proven results that base a
              cryptosystem only on worst case complexity assumptions, and to develop
              practical, secure public-key cryptosystems that are based only on worst case
              complexity assumptions.  The proposed work will also advance the general theory
              of average case complexity.
