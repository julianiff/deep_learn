This award to Oregon State University will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Wecoma, a research
              vessel operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes water sampling bottles, CTD computers, nutrient/oxygen
              titration equipment, an acoustic ranging deck unit, temperature/humidity
              sensors, and replacement of coring equipment lost and damaged at sea. The
              coring equipment is used on a variety of UNOLS research vessels throught the
              NORCOR coring facility at OSU.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Northeast
              Pacific Ocean, during 1999 and future years.
