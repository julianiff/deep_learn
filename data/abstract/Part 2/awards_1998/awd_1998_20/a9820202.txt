This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use
              on Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus, three research vessels operated by the
              institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a backup
              conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system with samplers, a pressure
              calibration piston, large-volume seawater pumps, seasurface temperature,
              salinity and fluorometer systems, a portable salinometer, a lowered acoustic
              doppler current profiler, and software for shipboard data distribution.  The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              studies worldwide during 1999 and future years.
