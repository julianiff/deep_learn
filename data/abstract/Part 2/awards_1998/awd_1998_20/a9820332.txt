During the 1990-2003 summers the
              Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maine will offer ten
              undergraduate students the opportunity to actively participate in research. 
              Students will receive financial awards plus a subsistence allowance.  The
              available research projects include (1) Environmental Sensors; (2) Intelligent
              Systems for Automation; (3) Communications Devices and Applications; (4) Motion
              Control; (5) Microprocessor/Instrumentation Applications; (6) Growth and
              Characterization of Thin Film Materials; and (7) Power Systems
              Applications.

At least five students will come from institutions where
              research opportunities are limited and at least four students will be women,
              minorities or students with disabilities.  Students chosen for the program will
              have displayed a high degree of initiative and independence of thought in both
              laboratories and course work.  Student research projects are chosen to match
              the student's interest and educational level.  In addition to extensive
              University facilities, students will also have access to facilities at various
              nearby industries such as Sensor Research and Development Corporation, BIODE
              Corporation, Bangor Hydro Electric and Central Maine Power Companies, James
              River, Champion, and Scott Paper Companies, Digital Equipment Corporation,
              Fairchild and National Semiconductor.  At the program culmination a written
              report and an oral seminar are required from the student.  Three academic
              credits are awarded to the student upon satisfactory completion of the
              program.
