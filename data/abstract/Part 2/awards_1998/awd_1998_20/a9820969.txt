Abstract    :
              
 

Two novel concepts to achieve single-mode, single-lobe operation of high
              power surface emitting lasers are proposed.  The first concept is to use a
              second-order complex-coupled grating for favoring of symmetric mode. The second
              concept is to use first-order Bragg grating reflectors on both sides of the
              second-order grating to insure a uniform near-field intensity profile.  The
              devices will be made with InGaAs/InGaP/GaAs, Al-free, strained-layer quantum
              well structures.  A 20-element anti-guide phase-locked laser array is expected
              to emit diffraction-limited beam, normal to the chip surface to power levels
              over a watt range.
