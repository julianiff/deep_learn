Abstract    :
              Grand Valley State University and the National Science Foundation will support
              eight students in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in
              mathematics during the summer of 2000. In this eight      week program,
              undergraduate REU fellows will work with five Grand Valley mathematics faculty
              on projects from relatively new areas of mathematics including chaos and
              fractal geometry, wavelets, and distance geometry. The program will be based on
              three important beliefs about what student participants should experience:  (1)
              a gradual but noticeable development from a learning style somewhat dependent
              on a textbook and a professor to a style of intellectual independence;  (2)
              collegiality among students and faculty, for      mathematics is best if not
              pursued alone;  and (3) an opportunity to communicate ideas and results, both
              orally and in writing.  Past undergraduate mathematics projects at Grand Valley
              have resulted in     presentations at local, regional, and national meetings
              and publications in the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal and the Mathematics Magazine.
