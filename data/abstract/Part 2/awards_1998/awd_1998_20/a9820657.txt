Abstract    :
              The research objective is to identify strategies and learning techniques for
              automated agents that will be able to participate successfully in auctions and
              negotiations.  Auctions and negotiations can be used to resolve conflicts in a
              wide variety of multi-agent domains. Our main application domain will be
              electronic commerce.  We will also continue to develop our simulation of
              document allocation in distributed information servers. These agents have
              insufficient information upon which to base strategic decisions.  Thus, we
              propose
to identify learning methods for agents participating in auctions.  We
              will use well known learning techniques and will focus on the questions: how
              accurate are the agent's expectations based on the learned information?  and
              how does the learning process influence the negotiation and the auction
              outcome?  Finally, human-computer experiments will be conducted focusing on the
              extent to which the information collected and evaluated by automated agents
              will be accessed and utilized by human participants in auctions.  The
              significance of this research lies in its contribution to the development of
              autonomous agents capable of reaching mutually beneficial agreements
              efficiently in complex environments characterized by uncertainty and incomplete
              information.  Our results will be particularly applicable to the emerging areas
              of electronic commerce and digital libraries.
