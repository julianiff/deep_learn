Abstract    :
              A coordinated experimental and theoretical study of the evolution, selection,
              stability, and impact of spatiotemporal temperature pattern formation on
              single, three-dimensional, catalytic pellets and in radial-flow reactors will
              be carried out.  An infrared thermal imager will be used to measure the
              temperature patterns on the top and sides of cylindrical pellets in a
              custom-built continuous flow stirred tank reactor.  The study will determine
              the possible patterns, their dependence on operating conditions, and the
              influence of interparticle transport limitations and pellet size.  Model
              reactions include the oxidation of carbon monoxide on palladium catalysts and
              the oxidation of hydrogen on a nickel catalyst.  Experiments in a radial-flow
              reactor will provide information about the types of temperature patterns that
              may evolve.  This information can be used to develop control strategies.  The
              study will also provide information about the conditions leading to the
              formation of hot spots, an event which may lead to severe safety problems in
              commercial reactors.  This information is needed for the rational development
              of operation and control policies that circumvent their hazardous formation. 
              Theoretical and computational studies will be conducted to simulate the
              experimental systems and to help find optimal regions of operation.
