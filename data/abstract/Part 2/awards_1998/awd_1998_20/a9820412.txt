Abstract    :
              The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame will
              sponsor a NSF-REU Site for Undergraduate research during the summers of 1999 -
              2001. The focal point of the project is the use of model Systems and basic
              research to study the cellular and molecular basis of disease. A nationwide
              search will be conducted for 13 sophomore or junior participants, 9 of who will
              be supported by the NSF and 4 by the Graduate School at the University of Notre
              Dame. The program will emphasize the recruitment of women, minority students,
              disabled students, and students from small colleges by soliciting applications
              from traditionally minority schools and from small colleges within
              approximately 300 miles of the Notre Dame campus. Participants will carry out
              research projects for 9 weeks. During these 9 weeks, they will speak on their
              proposed work at the beginning of the summer and will present their results at
              the end of the summer at the REU Summer Symposium. A weekly graduate student
              seminar program will be included to expose students to modern biological
              methods and to introduce students to research they might do in graduate school.
              In addition, students will participate in regular group meetings in their
              research labs and attend special workshops on career choices in the sciences,
              the value of basic research, ethics, problem solving, scientific writing, and
              team building. This program will give students experience in generating and
              analyzing their own research results as well as effectively reporting
              scientific information. It will also educate them on the important issues of
              professionalism; ethical conduct, collaboration, and other skills needed to
              succeed in the scientific arena. The underlying aim of the program is to give
              students strong incentives for pursuing careers in research.
