Manipulating metric spaces is a basic task in many
              areas.  Clustering, data visualization, and nearest neighbor searches are some
              of the standard primitives which come up in almost any data-intensive domain. 
              One of the most useful unifying approaches to addessing these problems involves
              the notion of an embedding.  In an embedding, an input metric is mapped into
              another metric for which useful algorithms have been developed.

This project
              considers basic algorithmic problems in metric space embeddings.  Some of the
              problems were abstracted from work in image database indexing, protein database
              indexing and phylogency construction.  However, most problems studied are basic
              algorithmic questions.
