This project will model stress changes induced by large
              earthquakes in the South Island, New Zealand, and Prince William Sound, Alaska,
              to better understand stress changes through time. The investigators will relate
              these changes to time variable earthquake hazard.  This is a collaborative
              effort between Dr. Diane Doser of the University of Texas at El Paso and Dr.
              Russell Robinson, a seismologist at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear
              Sciences in Lower Hutt, New Zealand.  Dr. Doser is an expert in seismological
              studies of historic earthquakes.  Dr. Robinson has developed software to
              analyze stresses induced by earthquakes and has extensive knowledge of the
              recent seismicity and tectonics of New Zealand.
