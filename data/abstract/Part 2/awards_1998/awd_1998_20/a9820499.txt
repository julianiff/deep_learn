Abstract    :
              This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate
researchers in
              mathematics and mathematical computer science
working under the supervision of
              faculty advisors. The program
will run for eight weeks each summer during the
              years 1999, 2000,
and 2001.
The principal investigator organizes and
              supervises the program.
Three faculty members from the Mathematics Department
              and the
Computer Science Department will supervise student research
projects.
              

The students will attend a seminar and will be given information
about
              various areas of mathematics and computer science. The
projects that the
              students work on will be designed so as to make
the students familiar with the
              process of mathematical research.
The projects will emphasize the interaction
              between pure and
applied mathematics. Each student must complete a written
              report
on their research activities for inclusion in a proceedings of
the
              summer program. Some post-program support will be available
for the students
              to present the results of their research
at conferences.
