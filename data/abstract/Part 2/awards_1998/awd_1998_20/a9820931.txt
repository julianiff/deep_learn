Abstract


This project studies approximation algorithms
              in certain metric spaces, especially weighted planar graphs and low-dimensional
              Euclidean spaces, possibly with obstacles.  Problems studied include
              light-weight spanner graphs for such metrics, separators with appropriate
              trade-offs between weight and connectivity, reductions between metric spaces,
              and algorithmic design principles such as dynamic programming and random
              sampling.

The main objective is the development of efficient approximation
              schemes for well-known optimization problems in these metrics; these problems
              include the Traveling Salesman Tour, The Steiner Tree, and the k-MST.  A second
              objective is to consider less tractable problems such as partitioning and
              clustering, and also variants such as online approximation algorithms.  A final
              objective is to consider limits of these techniques, for example hardness
              results for finding separators or spanners in more general metric spaces.
