Abstract    :
              A Research Experience for Undergraduates site will be continued at the Physics
              Department at Florida International University (FIU).  Undergraduate students
              who have completed a physics with calculus course will perform original
              research under the supervision of physics department faculty members.  The
              research will be in one of the following areas: atomic, molecular and optical
              physics; polymer physics; quantum optics; astronomy; theoretical solid state or
              biophysics and nuclear physics.  The students will be in residence at FIU for
              at least ten weeks.
