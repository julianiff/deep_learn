	Following upon his productive research under a NSF Postdoctoral
              Fellowship in the Environmental Sciences, Dr. Paul Kores at the University of
              Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Biological Survey is studying the evolution of
              nuclear and chloroplast genes in orchids of the tribe Vanilloideae. DNA
              sequencing of a number of chloroplast genes has revealed apparently elevated
              rates of mutation (or nucleotide substitution) in orchids that grow by
              attaching themselves to underground root-fungus structures, known as
              mycorrhizae. The orchids are thought to be hemiparasites, deriving nutrition
              from the mycorrhizal association and conducting reduced photosynthesis. A
              recently proposed phylogeny or family tree for the vanilloid orchids, based on
              data generated by Dr. Kores and colleagues, provides a framework for estimating
              the number of times and the patterns or trends in which plant genes have lost
              function, as photosynthetic activity becomes less important in the nutritional
              life of the plant.
	Molecular evolutionary research on plants has been greatly
              facilitated by advances in phylogenetic research over the last several years.
              Detailed phylogenetic trees provide step by step insight into likely pathways
              of evolutionary change in both form and function. Under assumptions about
              relaxed functional constraints on photosynthesis, this research on plant gene
              evolution will explore rates and patterns of mutation in so-called parasitic
              and saprophytic orchids.
