Ten women will be involved in field and laboratory research
              to determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west central
              Minnesota.  This includes the continuation of three closely related projects,
              which have in common the utilization of till analysis to determine the origin
              and glacial history of four problematic deposits.  U.M.M., an undergraduate
              institution, offers excellent facilities and close faculty contact.  R.E.U.
              women will have the opportunity to develop collegial ties with other
              undergraduates doing geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and
              role models to underrepresented high school students participating in college
              level research.  The research experience and the unique opportunity to interact
              with a scientific community where underrepresented individuals are in the
              majority will both break down a number of traditional barriers and aid in the
              maturation of these students as scientists.  The culmination to the program,
              the "Friends of UMM REU" conference, will provide these women with the
              opportunity to present results and discuss ideas with experts in the field. 
              Additionally a field trip to the Canadian Rockies will show participants active
              glacial processes and glacial environments.  The REU program will contribute to
              the personal growth of these women and the research to be accomplished will
              contribute to the understanding of the glacial history of Minnesota.
