Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University establishes a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site, its theme is adhesives and
              adhesion science.  Eight undergraduate students are recruited every year
              nationwide for an eleven-week summer research experience, with specific
              recruitment efforts at historically black colleges and universities in the
              Southeast.  Undergraduate students participate in science and engineering
              research projects that include testing of adhesive bond durability and of its
              fracture strength, synthesis and characterization of dendrimers, and
              characterization of waterborne epoxy resins.  In addition, REU participants
              attend a weekly seminar on oral and written communication skills and several
              social activities.

The interdisciplinary nature of the subject area provides
              students with a realistic exposure to research on complex problems where
              several lines of attack involving different scientific and engineering
              disciplines can bring greater understanding of key issues and more rapid
              progress toward their solution.
