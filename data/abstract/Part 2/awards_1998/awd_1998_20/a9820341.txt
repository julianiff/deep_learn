Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. William D. Horrocks in the Department
              of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University.  The ten participants,
              recruited from Penn. State, the Northeast and middle Atlantic regions, will
              take part in research projects from areas that include analytical, bioorganic,
              bioinorganic,biophysical, organic, materials and physical chemistry.  In
              addition to research, participants will attend a program of lunchtime seminars
              given by the faculty and will participate in a four-hour workshop devoted to
              scientific ethics.  Students will attend individual research group meetings
              and, at the conclusion of the program, will present an oral presentation at a
              minisymposium and will write a final research report in journal article format.
