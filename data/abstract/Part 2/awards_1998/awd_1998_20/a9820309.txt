REU: 
              Involving Undergraduates in Research at the Center for Intelligent Information
              Retrieval

This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project
              supports ten students per year in programs carried out during the summers for
              three years.  The students work on projects in the Center for Intelligent
              Information Retrieval (CIIR). The projects include work in image matching
              algorithms, machine methods for learning profile characteristics, retrieval of
              handwritten documents using image matching algorithms, and building Java
              interfaces for visualization.  The project has strong collaborative plans for
              the project with Mt. Holyoke College, an outstanding and nearby women's
              institution.

Students for the REU program are recruited nationwide, but the
              program focuses on students from the University of Massachusetts and the four
              nearby undergraduate colleges.  Faculty and students join in a group seminar
              that is used to describe, explore, and discuss research methodology, helping
              undergraduates learn what makes "good science".  The group-based approach is an
              important aspect of the REU at the CIIR.
