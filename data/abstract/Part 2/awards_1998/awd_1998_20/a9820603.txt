Drs. Terndrup, at the
              Ohio State University, and Peterson, of Astrophysical Advances, will carry out
              a collaborative project to survey the Galactic bulge for hot stars, those with
              temperatures in excess of 20,000 K, that are thought to be the source of the
              excess Ultraviolet light found in old, metal-rich extragalactic systems.  These
              stars have presented a puzzle, since such stars are not found in the metal-rich
              systems of globular clusters in our galaxy, yet are apparently common in
              elliptical galaxies and the bulges of other spiral galaxies.  This photometric
              and spectroscopic survey will take a complete census of several fields in the
              bulge of our galaxy, where preliminary work has uncovered a statistically
              significant sample of these hot stars, and where large enough samples of a
              metal-rich population can be obtained to identify stars in short-lived phases
              of stellar evolution.  The survey will identify the numbers of stars in each
              relevant evolutionary phase and derive metallicities for stars cool enough to
              be unaffected by diffusion, in several fields at varying distances from the
              Galactic center.
