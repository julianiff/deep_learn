Abstract    :
              This project bases its techniques on the field of algebraic methods to obtain 
              practical results of interest for theoretical  physics and soliton based
              optical communication.

One of the topics of this proposal deals with
              construction of the multi-component KP hierarchies starting from one-component
              KP hierarchy and utilizing a special infinite set of abelian additional
              symmetries.  From an application point of view, this leads to the prospect of
              obtaining new Wronskian solutions describing (2+1)-dimensional solitons.
              

The algebraic approach to the tau-function and soliton solutions in the
              context of representations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras with unconventional
              grading will also be investigated.  

The third topic of this proposal
              involves the formulation of supersymmetry in the framework of integrable models
              and finding the corresponding supersymmetric solitary waves.

Recently, some
              advances have been made with extending the notion of integrability to higher
              dimensional models.  We plan to study connections between this form of
              integrability and higher dimensional soliton solutions.  The emerging
              string-like soliton structures of higher dimensional models are quite
              intriquing and may find applications in various physical models of condensed
              matter physics and gauge field theory.
