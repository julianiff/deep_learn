Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Illinois State University
              supports the research of Professor Lisa F. Szczepura.  The theme of the
              research is the investigation of the mechanism of ligand substitution of
              supraoctahedral transition metal clusters of the form (M'M6X8)n (where M' and M
              are transition metals and X = S, Se, or Te) that are important for
              understanding cluster reactivity.  In particular, the effects of spectator
              ligands on the rates of ligand exchange will be examined.  A second goal is the
              study of the redox reactivity of supraoctahedral clusters.

The clusters
              studied in this project are part of a class of substances called Chevrel phase
              materials, which exhibit superconducting properties even in high magnetic
              fields.  However, other applications include use as heterogeneous catalysts and
              as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion batteries. 
              Studies of these types of clusters have a significant impact on the development
              of new lithium batteries with increased cycle life.
