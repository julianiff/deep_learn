Abstract    :
              	This proposal requests funds to pursue high precision oxygen isotopic
              measurements of tropospheric ozone in an effort to better understand
              tropospheric ozone chemistry.  All three oxygen isotopes (O-16, O-17, and O-18)
              will be measured on atmospheric ozone samples using stable isotope ratio mass
              spectrometry.  Measurements are proposed to address the extent and variability
              of ozone transport and transformation rates, remote marine ozone chemistry, and
              the magnitude of stratospheric ozone injections into the troposphere.
