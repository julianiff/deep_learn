This Interagency transfer will contribute to
              support participation in a community workshop on future research directions in
              nearshore sediment transport and deposition.  The workshop is sponsored by
              USGS, with contributions from several other agencies.  In addition to
              identifying the most important directions for the next five years, participants
              will also discuss how to make their work relevant to societal needs, and how to
              expand their interactions with related fields of science.
