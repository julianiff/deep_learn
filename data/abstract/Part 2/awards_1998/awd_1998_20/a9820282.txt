Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site directed by Dr. Tracy P. Hamilton in the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.  The ten participants,
              recruited from local and regional institutions, will take part in a program
              based upon training on state-of-the-art facilities in the forefronts of
              research, use and understanding of journal articles, formal training in
              scientific ethics, exposure to different types of research careers through
              seminars and field trips, improving scientific communication through making a
              presentation, exposure to an ethnically and culturally diverse workplace, and a
              sense of accomplishment from successful completion of real life tasks. 
              Traditionally underrepresented groups will be targeted through linkage with the
              existing  NSF supported Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program and
              the Alabama SEED program.
