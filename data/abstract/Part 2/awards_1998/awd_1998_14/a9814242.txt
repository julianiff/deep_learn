Shear-wave splitting observations in the vicinity of
              subduction zones of the Pacific indicate that average olivine a-axis
              orientations beneath back-arcs are variable within and between subduction
              zones, and those beneath slabs in the seaward-side mantle are predominantly
              parallel to the trenches.  The PI proposes to use a 3-D numerical model to
              study the effects of simultaneous down-dip and rollback motion of a non-planar
              plate, and the motion of an overriding plate on upper mantle flow and
              anisotropy in the vicinity of a subducting slab.  The influence of simultaneous
              slab motion, plate geometry and overriding plate kinematics on mantle flow and
              anisotropy needs to be examined in more detail than has presently been done. 
              The 3-D numerical model will produce results that can be compared to current
              shear-wave splitting observations.
