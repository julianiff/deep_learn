Abstract    :
              Black Lion Tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysopygus) are only found in the
Atlantic
              Forest of the Interior in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  This
species of New
              World primate exhibits a form of social organization that is
primarily
              monogamous and thus stands in sharp contrast to the social
systems of the
              majority of primate species.  Additionally, this species is
currently
              distributed across an array of forest fragments of different
sizes, not unlike
              the postulated distributions of many New World primate
species at the height
              of the last glaciations of the Pleistocene.  Finally,
the black lion tamarin
              is part of a species complex that includes three
other taxa, all of whom are
              interrelated in ways that are not entirely
clear.

The proposed research
              will allow the investigators to (1) determine the effects of a
monogamous
              social system on mating patterns and the dispersal of genetic
traits within
              populations; (2) examine the effects of a species' range
fragmentation on the
              dispersal and distribution of genetic traits among
populations; and (3)
              estimate the evolutionary relationships among the
different lion tamarins,
              with particular reference to the position of the
black lion tamarin.  In
              accomplishing these three goals, we will expand our
knowledge of the genetic
              and evolutionary consequences of primate social
organization by adding a new
              system, monogamy, whose effects upon the
distribution of genetic traits and
              the dynamics of evolutionary genetic
change remain largely unknown.
