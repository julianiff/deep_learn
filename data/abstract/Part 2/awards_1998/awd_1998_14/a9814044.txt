The purpose of this U.S.-Vietnam Cooperative Research Project
              is to gain an in-depth understanding of the structure-magnetic property
              relationships found in two representative members of a unique family of
              materials, the bulk amorphous alloys.  The researchers will investigate the
              role of minor alloying additions on the formability and magnetic properties of
              the ferromagnetic bulk alloys.  The Vietnamese counterpart is Dr. Nguyen Chau,
              Department of Physics, Natural Science University/National University of Hanoi.
               The foci of research efforts on magnetic materials at the Brookhaven National
              Laboratory and in Vietnam are complementary.
