Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to study children's construction of fractional
              schemes in the context of the children interacting in computer environments in
              pairs under the guidance of a teacher-researcher.  Using a videotaped data of
              approximately 630 teaching episodes with six pairs of children over a period of
              three years, a retrospective analysis will be conducted for each pair of
              children.  The child-child and adult-child social interactions will be analyzed
              along with the interaction in the computer environments and correlated with an
              analysis of the children's mathematical activity both individual and social. 
              The case study of each pair of children will be subjected to a scientific
              analysis in which the children's fractional schemes and construction of those
              schemes are abstracted and organized into a coherent structure.  Piaget's
              hypothesis that mathematics is contributed by the individual to the
              interactions and Vygotsky's hypothesis that the source of mathematics resides
              in the internalization of social interaction will be continually tested through
              both kinds of analysis (retrospective and scientific).  To the extent that
              these hypotheses are falsified,  a model of learning that supersedes both
              Piaget's and Vygotsky's models also will be continually tested in which subject
              environment interactions and within subject interactions are co-implicated.
