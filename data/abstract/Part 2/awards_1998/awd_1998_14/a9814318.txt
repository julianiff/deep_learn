Abstract    :
              It is widely recognized that physics has played a major role in the great
              scientific achievements of the 20th century.  To celebrate the 100th
              anniversary of the establishment of the American Physical Society (APS) in
              1999, the APS has commissioned the production of a timeline wall chart
              depicting the major events and applications of 20th century physics.  The
              timeline wall chart consists of 11 panels, spanning the 20th century and is
              organized along five (5) timeline strands listing discoveries and contributions
              of physics to basic knowledge and applied technologies.
The five (50) strands
              include 1) COSMIC: the world of the very large of astronomy and cosmology; 2)
              HUMAN SCALE: the physical world we live in from the global to the microscopic;
              3) ATOMIC: the world of the small, atoms, nuclei, particles, and their
              constituents; 4) LIVING WORLD: the role of physics in biology and medicine, and
              5) TECHNOLOGY: the impact of basic and applied physics and its role in everyday
              life.  The timeline wall chart is written and illustrated so as to be
              attractive to high school students and non-science college students.
As part
              of the APS Centennial celebration, the APS plans to have 20,000 copies of the
              timeline wall chart printed and then distributed free of charge to every high
              school, two- and four-year college and university, as well as other appropriate
              institutions such as science museums, research laboratories and science
              libraries in the United States.  A teacher's guide to the timeline wall chart
              will be prepared and distributed with the timeline.  In addition, a web site
              based on timeline wall chart events and illustrations will be developed.
