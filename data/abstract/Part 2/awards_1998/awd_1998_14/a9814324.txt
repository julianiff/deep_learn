This
              project will model the carbon cycle in the Arctic Ocean by attempting to couple
              separate biological and physical models of processes that interact in the
              ocean.  The coupling of the models, for example, will facilitate examination of
              the effect of small scale physical forcing on the ecosystem, a process known to
              be important at the edge the continental shelf.  The models will allow
              prediction of the effects of global change on the arctic shelf-basin ecosystem.
               The changes are potentially critical to the viability of the ecosystem that
              supports high biologic productivity on the continental shelf.  The results of
              this project are expected to provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field
              program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002.
