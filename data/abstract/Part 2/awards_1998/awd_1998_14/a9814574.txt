Abstract    :
              This award supports a program of radar studies of internal stratigraphy and
              bedrock topography along the traverses for the U.S. component of the
              International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE).  The radar will
              provide information immediately available in the field on ice thickness and
              internal layer structure to help in the selection of core sites as the traverse
              proceeds.  These data will also be useful in siting deeper millennial scale
              cores planned at less frequent intervals along the traverse, and in the
              selection of the location for the deep inland core planned for the future.  In
              addition to continuous coverage along the traverse route, more detailed studies
              on a grid surrounding each of the core locations will be made to better
              characterize accumulation and bedrock topography in each area.  This proposal
              is complimentary to the one submitted by the Cold Regions Research and
              Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), which proposes a high frequency radar to
              examine the shallower portion of the record down to approximately 60 meters,
              including the presence of near-surface crevasses.   The radar proposed herein
              is most sensitive at depths below 60 meters and can depict deep bedrock and
              internal layers to a substantial fraction of the ice thickness.
