Abstract    :
              9814066  Pinsky   This award provides support for a workshop on mathematical
              finance. The   workshop will be held in conjunction with the Twentieth Midwest
              Probability Colloquium.   The Colloquium attracts 75-100 researchers in
              mathematical probability theory, mostly   from the universities in the greater
              midwest area but also from more distant locations. This   workshop will provide
              researchers in probability with the opportunity to learn more about   its
              applications to mathematical finance.  NSF funds will be used primarily for
              travel   support with emphasis placed on encouraging attendance by junior
              researchers and   members of underrepresented groups.
