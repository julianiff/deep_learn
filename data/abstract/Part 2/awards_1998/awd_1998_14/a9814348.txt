	Fault-propagation folds and the blind faults that
              produce them are of interest for their role in thrust  belts and extensional
              provinces, and for their seismogenic potential and other applied aspects.  A
              kinematic model can explain many of the features associated with such
              structures, which are more complicated to explain by other kinematiac
              fault-fold models.  However, the "Trishear" model has not been fully applied
              due to the lack of any scientifically objective way of selecting key parameters
              of the model.  A recently developed six parameters grid search inversion
              program extracts the best-fitting trishear model from real structures.  This
              project will use this new program to extensively test this inversion program,
              estalish geologic physical controls on parameters and implications of the
              modeling results.  This work is expected to estalish the range of conditions
              under which it applies and to provide a methodology for its application.
