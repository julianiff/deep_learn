Support is requested for the "Extremophile Research: Theory and
              Techniques" course presented by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
              Education Program and the Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB), University of
              Maryland Biotechnology Institute.  The course will be held at COMB facilities
              at the Columbus Center, Baltimore, MD, on July 6-9, 1998.  "Extremophile
              Research: Theory and Techniques" includes a one day symposium and a three day
              intensive laboratory workshop.  The symposium brings experts from various areas
              of extremophile research to discuss the current state of knowledge on growth,
              biochemistry and genetics of extremely anaerobic methanogens, hyperthermophiles
              and extreme halophiles.  The laboratory sessions include lectures and blocks of
              demonstration and hands-on experiments focussing on specialized techniques used
              to study these groups of organisms.  Because of the high operating costs for
              the laboratory sessions, accessibility to faculty from small colleges and
              universities, as well as post-doctoral and graduate students, is limited by
              their ability to secure funds.  To address this problem, funds will be used to
              provide full-tuition scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate
              students and post-doctoral fellows working in various areas of extremophile
              research, as well as half-tuition fellowships to assist faculty from small
              colleges and universities who will be able to include these experiments in
              their curriculum.
