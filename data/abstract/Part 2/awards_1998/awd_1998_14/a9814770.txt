Abstract    :
              This award seeks to achieve broad, systemic change using mathematical modeling
              as the common threat that provides connections between mathematics, computer
              science and engineering.  It proposes to create and use technological support
              that will motivate integration between classes.   The PI proposes the use of a
              common notation, a forum for students to get and supply help in this common
              notation, and a resource library that integrates across classes.  They propose
              to test this approach by bridging computer science classes (where students
              learn MATLAB) and engineering classes (where they utilize mathematical
              modeling).  The key elements of the scheme are 1) a common meeting space and 2)
              a common cross-indexed library
