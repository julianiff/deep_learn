The New York Hall of Science will develop, test, and implement
              the "Biochemistry Discovery Lab," a 1000-sq.-ft. space designed to complement
              the content and design of "The Chemistry of Living Things," a 3000-sq.-ft.
              exhibition that will be opening in 1999.  The Biochemistry Discovery Lab will
              engage visitors in four different types of activities:  1) guided experiments
              for scheduled groups,  2) self-guided experiments,  3) demonstrations, and  4)
              the prototyping of ancillary materials.  These activities are intended to
              engage the target audiences -- families, students, and the general public -- in
              experiences leading to an understanding that chemical reactions are due to the
              interaction of molecules; that chemical reactions occur in both living and
              nonliving things; and that there are visible and measurable characteristics of
              chemical reactions in living and nonliving systems.
