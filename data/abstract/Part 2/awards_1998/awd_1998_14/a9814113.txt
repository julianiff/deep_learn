The aggregation processes
              of contaminants in natural waters are experimentally simulated in laboratory
              using a quiescent, continuous flow, fluid column with optical measuring
              capabilities for particle size and velocity.  Particle settling rates and
              aggregation are measured over extended time intervals for various particle size
              distributions and water chemical characteristics.  The experiments will be
              carried out with silica spheres and titania coated silica spheres of 0.3 to 4
              microns, at various concentrations, under the effect of various ligants and
              electrolites and at different pH values.    Numerical solution of the
              Smoluchowski's equation and the calculation of the collision efficiency using
              classical theory (DLVO) and the triple layer model for surface complexation.
              

The proposed studies have relevance to transport and fate of contaminants
              in polluted sites, as well as to development of remediation methods and water
              treatment processes.
