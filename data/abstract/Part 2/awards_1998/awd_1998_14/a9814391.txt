Conclusions regarding the nature of clay mineral
              transformations and the characteristics of those clays which have derived from
              XRD and TEM data are frequently conceived as being incompatible, especially as
              relates to smectite/illite and the concept of fundamental particles.  Because
              conclusions are based on observations of metastable systems whose states are
              controlled by factors affecting kinetics, conclusions differ in part because of
              differences in rock types and environment of formation.  TEM data are largely
              based on observations of shales, whereas other data are largely derived from
              bentonite and hydrothermal systems.  We propose to study low-grade clay mineral
              systems using integrated XRD and TEM techniques to resolve differences in
              interpretation both in terms of methods and geological origin.   Systems to be
              studied include bentonites from the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal field, North
              Sea geopressured siltstones, coeval metabasite and metabasite pairs over a
              broad range of grade, kerogen-rich black shales, and Salton Sea
              hydrothermal-metamorphosed sediments.
