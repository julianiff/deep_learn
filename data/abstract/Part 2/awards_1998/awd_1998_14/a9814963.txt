Abstract    :
                Abstract - 9814963 - Gulari   Prof. Erdogan Gulari will explore the
              feasibility of a new concept in microreactor array for the automated synthesis
              of DNA. In comparison with existing automatic DNA synthesizers, this system
              will increase the rate and reliability of the process, and the versatility of
              the resultant biochip technology.  The accelerated rate of synthesis is due to
              the use of projection photolithography instead of typical masking.  The
              versatility is a result of the very large combinatorial oligonucleotide
              sequence possible with the proposed technology. Several (bio)chemical, medical
              and genetic engineering activities will be impacted by the proposed work.
              Funding is provided by the Chemical Reaction Processes subprograms.
