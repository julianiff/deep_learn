This study will follow a
              group of 14 Êfocus students∆ through two years of secondary school mathematics,
              using in-class observation, clinical interviewing, and audio/video recordings
              of after-school working sessions to document and analyze changes in the way
              these students make and explain proofs.  A subset of these students were
              participants in an earlier longitudinal study of mathematical thinking (grades
              1 -  8).  This will allow detailed documentation of the intellectual histories
              of these students.

The goals of the project are (1) provide in-depth case
              studies of the development of proof making in high school students; (2) to
              investigate the relationship of students∆ earlier ideas and insights to later
              justifications and proof building; (3) to trace the origin, development and use
              of representations of student ideas, explorations, insights relating to
              explanation, justification and proof building.  Within the context of the
              learning community, additional goals are:  (4) to investigate the nature of
              teacher intervention in the growth of student mathematical ideas and (5) to
              study individual cognition in the context of the movement of ideas within the
              community of learners.
