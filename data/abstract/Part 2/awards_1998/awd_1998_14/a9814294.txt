Abstract    :
              9814294  RAYMOND  Three to twenty meter thick permanent ice covers on lakes in 
              the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctic contain viable microbial  cells in
              association with sediment aggregates.  These  aggregates are now recognized as
              sites where physical,  chemical and biological interactions promote microbial 
              growth under extreme conditions inherent to the ice  environment.  This
              interdisciplinary research program will  define specific processes which allow
              (1) the creation of  liquid water (the essential element for life) in the 
              permanent ice, (2) the survival and structuring of microbial  populations
              subjected to freezing and thawing, (3) the  production of substances which
              alter the physical attributes  of the ice crystal habitat and (4) nutrient
              supply to the  microbial populations which is essential for not only  survival,
              but net microbial growth and biomass accumulation.  The work will be on ice
              aggregates embedded within the  permanent ice covers on the lakes in the Taylor
              Valley,  which have been tentatively characterized in previous  studies. 
              Research on microbes in permanent ice provides  information on the ecology of
              microbes in ice ecosystems and  promises to have biotechnological implications.
               Furthermore, these studies will provide insights into the  conditions, which
              support or have supported life beyond our  own planet in association with water
              ice which is currently  present within and beyond our own solar system.
