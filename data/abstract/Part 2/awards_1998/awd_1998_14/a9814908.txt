This research involves the utilization of revolutionary
              improvements in seismic data, due to the Global Seismic Network and PASSCAL
              portable seismometer campaigns, in order to resolve mantle structure by means
              of body wave and surface wave techniques.  Considerable progress has been made
              in mapping out lateral variations in seismic velocity in the mantle,
              demonstrating the active dynamic processes going on beneath the earth's
              surface.  This research combines long-period surface wave inversion,
              travel-time tomographic imaging, and detailed whole record modeling.  An
              intercomparison of models independently derived from these varied techniques
              involving totally different data sets show great complexity but, fortunately,
              some agreement.  The major goal is to reconcile disagreements where resolvable.
               The major issues to be addressed are upper-mantle heterogeneity and its
              extension into the transition region (down to 670 km) and connections to lower
              mantle structures.  The long-wavelength circum-Pacific down-willing region
              needs to be localized into more discrete continuous seismic structures with
              reliable estimates of P and S anomalies and their sharpness.  Zones of slab
              buckling and abrupt thickening that are so abundant in dynamic models should be
              identifiable seismically.  Similarly, the large-scale slow structures beneath
              Africa and mid-Pacific, although well established near the CMB, are less well
              defined at shallower depths where models vary greatly.  The results are
              important as input to geochemical, mineral physical, and geodynamic models of
              the earth.
