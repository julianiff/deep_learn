Abstract    :
              The investigators will establish the spatial and temporal relationship between
              dayside hydrogen emissions and plasma reconnection sites at the magnetospheric
              boundary.  The technique is to observe the Doppler spectral profile of dayside
              auroral hydrogen in three directions from a station situated under the dayside
              aurora.  The objective will be accomplished by aiming three large-aperture
              spectrometers in different directions under the dayside aurora at Longyearbyen,
              Svalbard, to measure the hydrogen emission spectral profile simultaneously near
              the ionospheric foot point of reconnection events.  From these spectra, and
              other supporting optical data, the investigtors will deduce the location and
              the extent of the reconnection event on the dayside magnetopause, and the
              direction of convection.  If this method proves to be successful, an extended
              array of hydrogen emission observations from the ground or from space could
              produce a measure of the total reconnection rate and a picture of the
              reconnection process at the dayside magnetopause.
