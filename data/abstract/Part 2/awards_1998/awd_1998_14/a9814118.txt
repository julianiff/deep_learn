Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be the synthesis and characterization of
              polypara(phenyleneethynylenes) (PPE).  Acyclic diyne metathesis will afford
              PPEs, conjugated rigid rod polymers of interest as materials or photonic
              devices.  The polymers will be scrutinized with regard to fundamental optical,
              supramolecular and phase properties, to gain knowledge about interactions
              between the rigid rod polymer chains and the influence of these interactions on
              macroscopic properties.

With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Uwe H. F. Bunz of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina.  Professor Bunz
              will focus his work on developing methods for the synthesis and
              characterization of conjugated organic polymers known as
              polypara(phenyleneethynylenes) (PPE).  These polymers have potential for the
              construction of photonic devices that may be of technological importance.
