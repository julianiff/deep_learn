Abstract    :
              9814227  Cata    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National Science
              Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative, will
              focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in grades
              K-12 in the 13 schools and tribal communities which form the Coalition for
              Educators for Native American Children, Santa Fe, NM.  The primary purpose of
              the grant is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community
              stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education
              reform; study and select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the
              strategic planning of professional development; and identify available local,
              state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in
              support of this mathematics reform.
