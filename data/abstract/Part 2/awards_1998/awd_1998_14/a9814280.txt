Mountain building events are commonly accompanied by
              emplacement of granitic magmas, the origins of which are currently in debate.
              In many cases, granitic magmas are hybrids which form when hot magmas derived
              from the mantle combine with crustal rocks. In other cases, granitic magmas
              show isotopic and elemental evidence of a purely crustal origin. A crustal
              origin typically requires transfer of heat sufficient to cause melting. Many
              investigators call on heat extracted from hot, mantle-derived magmas as the
              primary source of such crustal melting. In the Velfjord area of north-central
              Norway, a group of mantle-derived plutons are nearly surrounded by a rind of
              granitic rocks that were apparently derived by local melting; heat was provided
              by intrusion of the mantle-derived plutons.  Because of the small scale, this
              setting provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the relationship
              between crustal melting and heat provided by hotter magmas. Research will focus
              on determination of the conditions of melting, the thermal requirements for
              melting, mobility of the granitic melts, and chemical interaction between the
              crustal melts and their magmatic "heat source".  The results will provide a
              direct analogue to melting that occurs on a crustal scale.
