Abstract    :
              ESI-9814225    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National Science
              Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative, will
              focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in grades 5-9
              in Fort Osage Public Schools.  The primary purpose of the grant is to
              facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community stakeholders in
              order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education reform; study and
              select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the strategic planning of
              professional development; and identify available local, state, and federal
              resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in support of this
              mathematics reform.
