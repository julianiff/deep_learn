This grant provides two years partial salary support for a
              computer technician to maintain the computer network at the Institute for
              Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at the Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography.  This is a phase II technician support grant under the
              Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program and follows three years of Phase I
              support (EAR-95-30529).  The IGPP Network Operations Manager, Pat Russo,
              maintains the IGPP computer operating systems and other software, performs
              regular backups of data files, installs and maintains new hardware, arranges
              for the cross-mounting of hard drives, provides printing services,
              troubleshoots problems, and ensures reliable network connectivity within IGPP
              and to the outside world.  Maintenance of this infrastructure is vital for the
              efficient operation of scientific computing for a large number of IGPP
              scientists, and the continued health of computational research at IGPP in
              seismology, oceanography, geomagnetism and geodesy.  As a condition of Phase II
              support from the Earth Sciences' Instrumentation and Facilities Program,
              SIO/IGPP will fully underwrite the salary of the network operations manager for
              a minimum of two years beyond the expiration of this award.
