The broad zone of deformation in eastern Asia
              encompassing the boundary of the Eurasian and North American plates is the
              least understood of major plate boundaries.  Recent availability of 
              high-precision geodetic (GPS) measurements in eastern Siberia, Korea, and
              Japan, together with seismological and geological data  provides the
              opportunity for a significant advance in understanding of  this enigmatic
              region.  To achieve this goal, the PI's will perform an integrated analysis of
              the repeated GPS measurements in 1999 of 15-20 key sites, and a morphological
              analysis of high-resolution topographic data for the region.  They expect their
              geodetic analysis to constrain, for the first time at the level of a few
              millimeters per year, the kinematics of deformation from central Asia to
              western North America.  The pattern of deformation across these areas will help
              to illuminate the tectonics of East Asia and their relationship to subduction
              of the Pacific plate and the India-Eurasia collision.
