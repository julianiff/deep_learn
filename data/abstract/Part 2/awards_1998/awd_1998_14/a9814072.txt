Abstract    :
              98-14072  Susan Vernon-Gerstenfeld  Ecological engineering, industrial ecology,
              environmental engineering  and environmental technology are terms and concepts
              that are being  applied to describe research topics that address societal 
              sustainability by solving environmental problems.  The objective of  this
              project is to provide support for relating a prior National  Science Foundation
              initiative that supported an experimental program  of research in appropriate
              technologies to current interests in  application of ecological principles to
              solutions of environmental  problems.  In the process of relating
              accomplishments of the prior  initiative in appropriate technology to the
              practice of ecological  engineering and concepts emerging from work to
              characterize industrial  ecology, it is expected this project will provide
              insights into  research needs, results of which will support advancement of 
              engineering practice as applied to solution of environmental problems.    The
              students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute who work on this  project will
              utilize their report to meet a requirement for successful  participation in an
              Interactive Qualifying Project the intent of which  is to have students
              complete a project during their work toward an  undergraduate degree that links
              issues of science and technology with  their social implications.  One of the
              final products of this project  is expected to be a substantive report that
              identifies research needs.  ***
