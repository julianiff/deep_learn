This research is an extension of an initial study (EAR-9506023)
              to investigate and develop the most suitable method for routine determination
              of major- and trace-element concentrations in natural fluid inclusions by
              LA-ICPMS.  The preliminary results suggest that it is possible to
              quantitatively measure elemental concentrations in natural fluid inclusions by
              using a set of artificial fluid inclusions within microcapillary tubes. The
              research objectives are three-fold; 1) to build and evaluate a new simple
              heating stage for homogenization of multi-phase fluid inclusions, 2) to examine
              various calibration methodologies for analysis of single fluid inclusions, and
              3) to apply the most suitable technique to examine four suites of well studied
              fluid inclusion samples. The calibration techniques include using;  1) the NIST
              glass reference
materials, 2) a set of new microcapillary-type artificial
              fluid inclusions containing a larger selection of elements in standard solution
              including the rare earth elements (REE), and 3) synthetic fluid inclusions
              containing known concentrations of specific elements. Upon selection of the
              most suitable calibration technique, elemental concentrations in fluid
              inclusions in halite from sedimentary basins (e.g., Palo Dura and Paradox),
              quartz from silicic magmas (e.g., Capitan Pluton), and hydrothermal quartz from
              porphyry copper deposits ( e.g., Bingham and Sar Cheshmeh, Iran) will be
              determined.  For the sedimentary basins, fluid inclusions provide information
              on the origin of the fluid and its evolution in the context of understanding
              the sedimentary and diagenetic environments in which the halites were formed
              and the composition of the seawater at the time of basin formation. Analyses of
              magmatically-derived fluid inclusions are essential to unraveling the history
              of fluid-rock interactions, petrogenetic modeling, construction of more precise
              models of the metal-transport capabilities of these fluids, and refinement of
              models of ore metals sources in deposits associated with silicic magma
              systems.
