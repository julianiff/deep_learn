Abstract    :
              9814265 Sengupta The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms
              which allow selective Al(III) recovery by composite ion exchange (CIX)
              materials while rejecting dissolved organic matter, manganese, heavy metals,
              arsenic and others.  Further, to utilize the understanding of these mechanisms
              to optimize the CIX properties for enhanced separation and recovery of alum
              from water treatment sludges.  Alum, or aluminum sulfate, is the most widely
              used coagulant in treatment of drinking water in the U.S. and is a major
              component (25-50%) of the two million tons of water treatment sludge solids
              disposed of daily.  The successful recovery and reuse of this material would
              not only reduce the demand for this resource, but more significantly would
              reduce the quantity of sludges to be disposed of while costs and environmental
              scrutiny increase.  Recent studies have demonstrated the prospect of
              selectively recovering metal precipitates from the complex background of sludge
              or slurry using a new type of CIX.  The thin-sheet morphology of the CIX  makes
              it compatible with the sludge medium while the functional groups offer high
              aluminum selectivity. This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent
              Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998.
