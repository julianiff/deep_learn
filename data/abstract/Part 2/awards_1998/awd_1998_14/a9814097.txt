Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this project is to develop molecular metabolic engineering
              techniques using the isoprenoid pathway in Escherichia coli as a model system. 
              The Principal Investigators (PIs) are to develop techniques for gene searching,
              metabolic sensing, and control of the engineered pathway.  The strategy for
              redirection 
of metabolic fluxes is to integrate the recombinant pathway into
              the global regulation loops of the cell such that the metabolic distrurbance to
              the cell will be minimized.
