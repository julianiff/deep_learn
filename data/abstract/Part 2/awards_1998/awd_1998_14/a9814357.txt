Abstract    :
                      9814357     CALDWELL    UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY     The aims of this
              research are to continue a multi-year experimental study of the effects of UV
              irradiation on terrestrial ecosystems. The field site is in southern Argentina,
              where increases in UV due to ozone depletion are the greatest on earth. 
              Experimental treatments focus on use of various combinations of UV filters to
              create a range of irradiation conditions.  A diverse array of individual
              responses are to be documented, ranging from direct UV effects such as the
              creation of lesions in leaves to indirect effects on invertebrate herbivore
              populations. Collaborators include several scientists from the University of
              Buenos Aires.  The work is important because, although the increase in UV at
              earth' surface is well-known and its causes are increasingly well understood,
              its consequences at the ecosystem level have received relatively little study.
