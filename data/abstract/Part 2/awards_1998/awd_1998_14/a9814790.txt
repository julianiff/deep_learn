The Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction was the
              youngest of the five largest known extinction events.  Because it occurred only
              65 million years ago, records of this event are much more common and generally
              much less altered than records of the other four great mass extinctions.
              Consequently, the K/Pg event provides an unparalleled opportunity for
              documenting how global ecosystems recovered from one of the most biologically
              devastating catastrophes ever identified.  We propose to take advantage of that
              opportunity by using K/Pg geochemical and paleontologic records to test
              fundamental hypotheses of marine biological recovery from mass extinctions.  In
              particular, we propose to test (1) whether the geologic record supports the
              hypothesis that planktic evolution was a necessary precondition for the
              recovery of organic fluxes to deep water (or vice versa), and (2) whether
              post-extinction records of marine plankton are consistent with a
              low-productivity Strangelove-ocean model or an altered-ecosystem
              normal-productivity model of ecologic recovery from the K/Pg mass extinction.
