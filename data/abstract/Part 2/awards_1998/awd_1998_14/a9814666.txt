The proposed research is to study flow and chemical
              transport in the mantle resulting from convection and plate tectonics.  It is
              motivated by the discordant inferences about mantle structure from geophysical
              observations of seismic structure and the geoid, and geochemical observations
              of isotopes in basalts at mid-ocean ridges and ocean islands.  This is a major
              discrepancy in our understanding of mantle dynamics and evolution.  The work
              will involve the calculation of mass transport, stirring and deformation in
              simple convective systems that incorporate lithospheric plate motions,
              evolution of plate geometry, viscosity variations with depth, as well as
              rheological heterogeneities.  The proposed work will evaluate these effects and
              assess the likelihood that such processes can account for the diverse
              geophysical and geochemical observations.
