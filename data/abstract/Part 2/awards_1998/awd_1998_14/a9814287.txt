Abstract    :
              9814287  Roman    The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) in collaboration with
              the Illinois State Museum (ISM), the St. Louis Science Center (SLSC), and the
              National Center for Supercomputing Applications(NCSA) at the University of
              Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, will form a museum consortium to develop two
              virtual reality interactive displays (River Pilot Simulator and Digital River
              Basin) and other web-based activities that focus on the Mississippi River. 
              This group will be known as the Mississippi River Web Museum Consortium.   Each
              museum will end up with both software modules that will lead visitors to the
              story of the River.  The river's local presence will serve as an entry point
              for the visitors at each museum.  The NCSA will contribute their access to and
              knowledge of powerful computer simulation, scientific visualization, and
              collaborations technologies that are usually restricted to research settings
              and rarely available to a museum audience or the general public.  The
              Consortium will also develop a shared site on the WWW that will invite users to
              engage in guided inquiry that will deepen their understanding of the large,
              complex, and integrated river system.  The science content underlying the
              project will include river hydrology and geomorphology, life sciences,
              environmental studies employing geographic information systems, and the physics
              of motion.  The activities will address a number of the National Science
              Education Standards.  Complementary programming linking these activities with
              formal education include a RiverWeb(tm) Posting Board and a RiverWeb(tm)
              Classroom Resource Guide.
