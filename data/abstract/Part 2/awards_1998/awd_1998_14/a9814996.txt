Abstract    :
              Future generation mobile communication systems are expected to provide high data
              rates and support a wide variety of services including voice, video and
              interactive multimedia. Unless batteries in the mobile communicators are used
              in the most efficient possible manner, power limitations will become a
              bottleneck in developing communication systems that can provide such
              services.


This project considers the problem of making highly efficient
              use of power in wireless multiple-access communications. To this end, a unified
              theory of multiuser receiver design and power control is being sought. The
              analytical tools and concepts necessary for a systematic development of such a
              theory are being obtained. The objective of the project is to ultimately obtain
              solutions for complex and realistic channel models that will make it possible
              to practically realize the superior potential of systems that adopt a combined
              approach to multiuser receiver design and power control. Efficient use of
              battery power translates into longer lasting (without recharge), lighter, and
              hence more portable, hand-held and lap-top communication devices.
