The thermal-mechanical stability of the lithosphere-mantle
              system ultimately depends on the nonlinear interaction of the tectonic forces
              and the responses elicited from the nonlinear temperature-and strain-rate
              dependent rheology.  In this two-year project the P. I. plans to study creep
              instabilities in both the oceanic and continental lithospheres, which have
              either an elasto-visco plastic or a viscoelastic rheology with realistic creep
              parameters.  He will also study critical factors that maintain the integrity of
              slabs.  All of these problems are rich in non-linearity and promise surprising
              but fundamental results, which should help to elucidate the critical character
              of lithospheric and mantle dynamics in the parameter range relevant to
              geological systems.
