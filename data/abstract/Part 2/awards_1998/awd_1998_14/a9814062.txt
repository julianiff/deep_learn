              a planning grant with a view to implementing, in the year 2000, a Local
              Systemic Change project in science for students grades K-6.  Planning
              activities with include:

An assessment of the needs of K-8 classroom
              teachers.

A plan for the professional development of the teachers.

A
              review of exemplary science curricula.

A plan for building and maintaining
              an adequate infrastructure to support the teaching and learning of science
              grades K-8.

The potential project will serve 379 teachers in the eleven
              schools in the county.  The schools will partner with UNC Chapel Hill,  Center
              for Mathematics and Science Education (CMSE) and the Chatham Education
