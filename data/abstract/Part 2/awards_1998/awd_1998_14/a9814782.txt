Abstract    :
              ***  9814782  This award is for support for a project to establish a detailed
              record of volcanism at Mt. Takahe volcano in Marie Byrd Land that will provide
              absolute age and elevation data on inland paleo-ice levels on the West
              Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) during the most recent glacial cycle.  Previous work
              at Mt. Takahe documented volcanic deposits located on the lower flanks that
              were erupted beneath, at, or above the level of the WAIS.  These deposits have
              been dated to between 104,000 and 7,000 years before present and suggest that
              the inland WAIS was much higher during the last glacial cycle than it is today.
                The inland paleo-ice level can be used  to test conflicting hypotheses about
              the configuration of the WAIS in late Wisconsin time and the role of  WAIS
              retreat in global sea level rise.  Well constrained limits on inland
              paleo-ice-levels during the past 100,000 years can be compared with global
              records of climate change in order to assess the relationship between the WAIS
              and the climate system.  Finally, precisely dated paleo-ice- levels can be used
              as "hard" input data for numerical models of ice sheet dynamics.  ***
