A newly-developed numerical model enables the investigators
              to consider the development and evolution of faults in models of continental
              extension.  The model simulates an elastic-plastic-viscous medium that is
              capable of developing localized deformation approximating faults.  Model
              simulations result in the development of an evolving system of faults.  The
              investigators propose to examine the size and number of half-graben units
              across the model rifts, the size distribution of faulting and the relative
              extension accommodated by large and small faults, the role of large
              rift-bounding faults, and the widening or narrowing of the active rift zone
              through time.  They will focus on the Gulf of Suez rift for which there is an
              extensive database and expertise.  They will also examine other rifts such as
              the East African rift, Anza trough, and Valencia trough, where available data
              document the pattern of faulting during rifting.
