Abstract    :
              REC 9814844
Christopher Impey, University of Arizona

The investigator
              proposes two small inter-related tasks.   Over the past ten years, he has
              collected 3600 questionnaires from non-science majors probing for science
              literacy and attitudes toward the science.  The study seeks to analyze fully
              the ten years of data using Statistic for non-parametric tests, multiple
              regression and analysis of variance.   Initial analysis indicates that science
              literacy is low and that formal classes and learning do little to alleviate
              naive conceptions.  It is hoped that the non-science student population at the
              University of Arizona will facilitate generalizeabiliy to a broader national
              college population.  

One area that may be a mediating factor in students
              misunderstanding of astronomy is the inability of textbooks to present diagrams
              and pictures in scaled, three-dimensional format.  This proposal will continue
              the development of a web based, multimedia teaching tool.  The project will
              focus on how students use and learn from this site.
