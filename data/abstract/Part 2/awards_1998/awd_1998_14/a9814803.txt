Abstract    :
              The National Center for Improving Science Education (NCISE) and Michigan State
              University(MSU) will conduct 4 case studies in selected countries.  The study
              will investigate induction experiences in the first years of teaching and
              preservice teaching experiences.  The study will investigate how systems help
              teachers bridge academic education, apply it to the realities of classrooms,
              and develop pedagogical understanding induction systems in other countries. 
              The study will be conducted as a case studies of other countries but will use
              existing US field work.  The first outcome of the project will be a systhesis
              of existing information, a design of case studies, and beginning efforts at
              international data collection.  The sutdy will produce written reports of each
              country's practices and implications for US policy makers during the research
              and writing process.
