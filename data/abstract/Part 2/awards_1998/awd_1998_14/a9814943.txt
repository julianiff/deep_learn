This award supports a radiogenic isotope study of a unique
              continental record of weathering and climate change preserved in a series of
              playa lakes in the southeastern California section of the Great Basin.  This
              chain of periodically interconnected lakes, referred to as the Owens River
              System, is the repository for essentially all of the clastic and chemical
              sediments shed over the past several million years from the eastern Sierra
              Nevada from just south of Mono Lake to the Garlock Fault.  Despite the large
              amount of work that has been carried out on the Owens Rivers System, there have
              been relatively few studies examining the sources of cations and clastic
              sediments in these Great Basin lacustrine basins.  
Strontium (Sr) and
              neodymium (Nd) isotopes are potentially sensitive tracers of cation inputs,
              both in the dissolved form and as suspended sediments.  Preliminary data
              suggest that these isotope tracers can be successfully used in the Owens River
              System to monitor (1) changes in location of chemical weathering and sediment
              sources (therefore of precipitation patterns); (2) the relationship of chemical
              to mechanical weathering in the alpine environment; and (3) hydrologic
              connectivity between lakes that share a common water supply during wet periods
              but that become closed, isolated basins during dry periods.  Integration of the
              results from the proposed study with previous and ongoing work in the Owens
              River System will provide powerful constraints on Quaternary climate shifts in
              the Basin and Range Province, which have in turn been linked to North Atlantic
              and global climate fluctuations.
