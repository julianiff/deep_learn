Abstract    :
              ESI-9814004  Buckridge    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National
              Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative,
              will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in
              grades 5-8 in Orange County Public Schools.  The primary purpose of the grant
              is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community
              stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education
              reform; study and select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the
              strategic planning of professional development; and identify available local,
              state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in
              support of this mathematics reform.
