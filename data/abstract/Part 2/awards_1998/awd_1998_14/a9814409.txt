Abstract    :
              9814409 Russo The objective of this research is to examine the early experience
              with the ISO 14001 environmental management standards.  These standards,
              finalized in 1996, are intended to support a voluntary program under which
              corporations and other organizations may adopt a set of process-oriented
              practices for environmental management.  Two questions will be addressed by
              this research.  First, what are the determinants of ISO registry?  In an
              industry populated by many competitors, what factors predict whether and when
              facilities will seek registry?  Second, has ISO registry influenced subsequent
              environmental performance?  Many corporations, wary of the cost and energy that
              must be invested in ISO 14001 registration, and regulators, since successful
              voluntary regulation can be fore effective than direct involvement by public
              bodies, would like to see the system's benefits demonstrated.  Viewing these
              research questions as empirical issues is valuable on its own.  But the field
              of organization theory points to several variables that can be expected to play
              roles in explaining antecedents and outcomes of ISO 14001 registration.  A set
              of preliminary hypotheses based on theories of how organizations respond to
              external stimuli are sketched out and applied to the ISO 14001 movement.  This
              study will concentrate on the American electronics industry, where considerable
              ISO 14001 activity has taken place.  Different methodologies will be used to
              test each of the research questions posed.  The study of the determinants of
              ISO registration will employ event history methods, which are well-suited to
              the analysis of discrete events occurring across time.  The study of the
              environmental effects of registration will employ multiple regression analysis
              using a number of control variables.  Once in place, the data base assembled
              under this research program will be updated periodically.  In this way, a
              complete source of information can be made available for analysis and
              dissemination in academic, professional and pedagogical outlets.  This grant is
              made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research
              Fellowships Program 1998.
