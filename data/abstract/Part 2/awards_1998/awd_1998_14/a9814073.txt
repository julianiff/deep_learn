Abstract    :
              Delaney  98-14073    The  REVEL  program  was  initiated  by  the  University 
              of  Washington  in 1996 with the intention of involving  science  educators  in
              oceanographic research.  The current  proposal  requests  funds to support the
              continuation of this  project  during  the summer of 1998.  Fourteen science
              teachers  will  participate in oceanographic research cruises to  study  the 
              hydrothermal  vent fields on the Endeavour  Segment  of  the  Juan  de Fuca
              Ridge.  The costs of the cruise are being paid  by  the University of
              Washington and the American Museum  of  Natural  History,  with funds for
              teacher participation  and  preparation requested in this proposal.
