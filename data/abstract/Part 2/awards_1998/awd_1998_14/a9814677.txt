The goal of this project is to understand how the vibrational
              and electronic spectroscopy of semiconductor clusters evolves with size.  This
              will be accomplished using a variety of negative ion photodetachment techniques
              developed in this laboratory.  Three specific classes of experiments are
              proposed:  Binary cluster anions, including boron nitride, alumninum nitride
              and phosphide, and silicon nitride, will be studied using high-resolution
              photoelectron spectroscopy and zero-electron kinetic energy spectroscopy;
              Photoelectron spectroscopy of large (up to 200 atoms) indium phosphide and
              gallium phosphide cluster anions will be carried out with the goal of
              connecting the electronic structure of these species with larger semiconductor
              clusters in the "quantum dot" size regime; A time- resolved experiment, anion
              femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy, will be used to extract vibrational
              frequencies of ground and excited electronic states of size-selected silicon,
              germanium, and indium phosphide cluster anions.

This project is very
              important to advancing materials research in that it bridges the gap in
              describing the physical and chemical behavior of small molecular clusters with
              that of the world of mesoscale and macroscopic behavior of device materials
              being developed for the world of electronic device applications.
