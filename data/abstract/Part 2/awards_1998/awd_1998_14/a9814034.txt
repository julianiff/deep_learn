Abstract    :
              This proposal request support to enable American and International scholars and
              graduate students to participate in the Conference on the History of Science
              Information Systems, as well as to broaden the dissemination and impact of the
              conference discussions. The history of science is a well established scholarly
              field, but study of the evolution of scientific information systems is a
              relatively new topic, rapidly gaining in importance as the information
              revolution unfolds.  This conference is the first event of significant scale
              solely devoted to the history and heritage of science information systems.   
              It builds on and extends two landmark conferences.  The first of these is the
              Scientific Information Conference convened by the Royal Society in London in
              1948, and the second, the 1958 International Conference on Science Information,
              sponsored by the National Science Foundation.  The present event is to be held
              immmediately preceding and in conjunction with the annual meeting of the
              American Society for Information Science (ASIS).
