	The continental margin of southern Alaska has a dynamic
              Jurasic-Tertiary tectonic history that included a transitiion from plate
              subduction to terrane collision and subsequent regional strike-slip faulting
              volcanism accompanied each of these changing tectonic environments, but many
              questions about magma source and evolution exist and there is no cogent model
              that explain their origin in the context of regional tectonic events.  This
              project will determine if there are co-magmatic relationships among the
              volcanic rocks to reveal any distinctive tectonomagmatic processes, determine
              the eruption history of the volcanic rocks and to document the nature of
              deformation before, during and after volcanism to better understand the
              kinematics of the transition between terrane accretion and strike-slip
              tectonics.  Results will be applicable to Alaskan geology and to other orogens
              where volcanism accompanied a charge in tectonic environment.
