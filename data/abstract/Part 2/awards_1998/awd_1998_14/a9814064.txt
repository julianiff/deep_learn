It
              is proposed to investigate electrophoretic deposition of particles as a
              selfassembling coating approach on a flat surface.  The proposed model will
              include a pair of hydrodynamic interaction.  Video experiments will be
              conducted to verify the model, obtain data for multiparticle aggregation and
              study the differences between direct current and alternating current in the
              dynamics of selfassembly process.  The authors suggests that hydrodynamical
              forces acting at particle scale play an important role on selfassembling.

If
              successful, the proposed selfassembling process of particles on a surface may
              lead to high quality single or multiple layer particle coatings for electronic
              and optical applications, as well as improved understanding of the dynamics of
              charged colloidal particles deposited on electrically polarized surfaces.
