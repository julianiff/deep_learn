Abstract    :
              9814221  Griffith    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National
              Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative,
              will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in
              grades 5-8 in the 34 rural area school districts in west central Arkansas that
              are member schools of the Arch Ford Educational Service Cooperatives.  The
              primary purpose of the grant is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics
              educators and community stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for
              mathematics education reform; study and select exemplary instructional
              materials; engage in the strategic planning of professional development; and
              identify available local, state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that
              can be coordinated in support of this mathematics reform.
