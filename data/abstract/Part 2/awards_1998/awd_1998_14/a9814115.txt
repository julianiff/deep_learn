This award supports the PI, William Layton and three graduate
              students from the University of Pittsburgh in a collaboration with Lutz Tobiska
              of the Department of Analysis and Numerical Mathematics at the University of
              Magdeburg, Germany.  The research focus is the development of mathematical
              ideas and computational algorithms for the simulation of physical problems
              involving 3-D fluid motion.  Such algorithms will prove useful in many fields
              of physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.  One primary purpose of the
              collaboration is to give U.S. graduate students training at the forefront of
              the field that also has an international component.  In particular, the
              research project will develop and test a finite-element code for the 3-D
              Navier-Stokes equations which incorporates the advances made through the funded
              research.
