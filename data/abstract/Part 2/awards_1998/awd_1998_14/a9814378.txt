This grant supports research aimed at improving the accuracy
              of the highly precise and very widely used 40Ar/39Ar method of geochronology. 
              Precision of the method is often better than 0.1%, but systematic errors from
              decay constants, data for standards, and the isotopic composition of potassium
              combine to limit the method's absolute accuracy to no better than 2%.  In this
              project, the investigators will conduct detailed comparisons between 40Ar/39Ar
              and U-Pb methods for carefully selected samples that are free of geologic
              complexities.  In ideal cases, the U-Pb method is accurate to about 0.3%, thus
              accuracy approaching this limit may be obtained for the 40Ar/39Ar system
              through intercalibration.  This work will be combined with experiments that
              will calibrate 40Ar/39Ar dating standards for the first time with the modern
              calendar through detailed analysis of potassium-rich minerals from the historic
              eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. The expected results of the project are a factor
              of ten or better improvement in accuracy of the 40Ar/39Ar dating method.
