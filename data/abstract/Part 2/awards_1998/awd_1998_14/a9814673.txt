This project is aimed at improving our knowledge of the
              motion of the Pacific plate, the tectonic plate that lies beneath most of the
              Pacific Ocean basin, relative to the earth's spin axis over the past 80 million
              years.  The motion relative to the spin axis is determined from the
              magnetization of the seafloor acquired when it was formed by seafloor
              spreading.  The direction of magnetization will be inferred from an analysis of
              skewness or shape-symmetry of small spatial variations of the magnetic field
              observed above Pacific plate seafloor.  The results will be applied to several
              important geologic and geodynamic problems.  For example, estimates of Pacific
              plate motion relative to the spin axis will be compared with motion of the
              Pacific plate relative to hotspots, such as the Hawaiian hotspot, which leave
              trails of volcanoes on the Pacific plate.  Differences between these two can be
              used to infer the motion of the hotspots relative to the spin axis, which has
              important implications for geodynamic processes such as true polar wander and
              mantle convection.
