Title:
              Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate Core Support

This is an award to
              the Board of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) which oversees and
              coordinates studies in atmospheric and climate sciences. BASC's mission is to
              advance understanding of Earth's atmosphere and climate, to foster application
              of this knowledge to benefit the public, to advise the federal government on
              problems and research programs within the Board's area of expertise, and to
              assist agencies in their development and implementation of strong research
              programs that are responsive to scientific opportunities and national
              interests.   BASC's interests generally fall within 10 major areas: climate
              variability and change research, structuring and operations of climate
              observing systems, optimization of weather observation and forecasting systems,
              improvement of predictions of climate variability and change of relevance to
              societies, advancement of methodology for assessing the consequences of climate
              change, research on atmospheric composition and chemistry and its effect on
              radiation transfer, research on the chemistry and transport of air pollution,
              advancement of prediction capabilities for space weather as it impacts
              human-managed systems, research on atmospheric/land interactions and research
              on atmospheric/ocean interactions. The work is important because it coordinates
              and oversees atmospheric and climate sciences for the federal managers and also
              assists in the development of relevant programs.
