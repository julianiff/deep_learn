Abstract    :
              A general theoretical framework for fault detection and diagnosis will be
              developed.  The main elements include fault identification, fault
              reconstruction,  and selection of the appropriate model dimensions.  A novel
              subspace control approach that can provide corrections to faults or
              disturbances in real time will be developed.  Fault detection will be
              accomplished by monitoring two detection indices.  The squared prediction error
              index detects significant variability in the residual subspace, and the
              Hotelling T2 index indicates operation beyond the historical limits.  An
              objective approach to determining the number of principal components for best
              fault construction is proposed.  Multivariate statistical methods, including
              principal component analysis and partial least squares, will be used to analyze
              the data and partition the measurement space into a normal and an abnormal
              subspace.  Because up to 40% of manufacturing costs are spent on maintenance
              and fault situation management, this project will have potential application to
              a problem of general industrial importance.  If successful, the project will
              accomplish the following four goals: (1) develop a novel root-cause analysis
              approach by fault reconstruction and identification, (2) provide an objective,
              well-established criterion for determining the number of principal components,
              (3) provide an integrated approach for subspace control and monitoring, and (4)
              establish a fundamental theory for fault detection, identification,
              reconstruction, and determination of the number of principal components.
