When two tectonic plates converge in a direction that is not
              perpendicular to the boundary between them, there are shear forces generated
              between the plates acting parallel to the boundary.  If this convergence occurs
              along a gently-dipping thrust fault then the upper plate may be, and very often
              is, deforming rapidly.  In many cases the part of the upper plate that rests on
              the subducting plate gets torn and moves along the margin, separated from the
              rest of the upper plate by a margin-parallel strike-slip fault.  In this study
              the P.Is. will examine the factors that control this process and from this will
              gain an improved understanding of the forces acting on the margin as well as
              the material properties of the Earth.  They will compile information on the
              process of strain partitioning globally as a guide to numerical computer
              experiments that simulate oblique subduction.  The main goals are to understand
              what measurements of deformation in this setting can tell us about the forces
              and rheology  in convergent margins and also to understand in general terms the
              factors that produce strike-slip faults.
