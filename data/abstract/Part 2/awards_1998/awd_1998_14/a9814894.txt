This award supports travel to China by Professor Dashen Shen,
              University of Alabama, to meet with counterpart Dr. Yu Yuehui of the Ion Beam
              Laboratory of the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy in order to develop
              cooperative research activities in SiC and AlN thin films.  The projects
              include synthesis and patterning of AlN films for application in field emission
              displays, and Silicon Carbide and its application in high temperature sensors
              and electronics. The Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy is one of the leading
              electronics institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
