Knowledge of the mechanisms and time scales for the production
              and differentiation of silicic magmas is critical to our understanding of
              fundamental geologic problems such as the formation and growth of the Earth's
              continents and predicting volcanic hazards.  Newly developed microsampling
              techniques will be used to obtain high precision Sr and Nd isotopic data from
              individual phenocrysts associated with two well-characterized, middle-Tertiary
              silicic magmatic centers in the southwestern United States.  When coupled with
              crystal size distribution studies this information will provide greater
              temporal resolution of the compositional evolution of silicic magmas than
              obtainable in studies utilizing bulk samples alone.  The first field area
              provides a unique opportunity to study the link between ash-flow tuffs and
              granitic batholiths in the Organ Mountains, southern New Mexico.  The second
              study area, a group of well-mapped and dated lava domes in southern-central New
              Mexico, will allow examination of the timing and dynamics of contamination and
              recharge during open-system evolution of silicic magmas. Together, studies of
              these two localities will provide new insights into both the large- and
              small-scale processes operating in complex continental silicic magmatic
              systems.
