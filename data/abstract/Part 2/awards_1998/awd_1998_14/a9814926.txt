The convergence of the Juan de Fuca plate and the
              northwestward motion of the Pacific plate relative to North America result in
              active deformation of the North American margin several hundred kilometers into
              its interior.  This deformation has the potential of producing large, damaging
              earthquakes and can be measured very accurately with the Global Positioning
              System (GPS) operating in the differential mode.  The investigators will
              utilize pre-existing GPS data gathered by the US Geological Survey between 1991
              and 1995 along with more recent measurements made by the National Geodetic
              Survey, local surveyors, and by the PIs to examine specific aspects of this
              deformation and their geological causes.  In this study the PIs will focus on
              the rate of northward transport of the coastal regions of Oregon and Washington
              and the role this transport plays in the growth of coastal mountains, the
              variations in strain rates along the coast possibly related to segmentation of
              the dipping thrust fault separating the Juan de Fuca plate from North America,
              and the location of the boundary between the northward moving coastal region
              and North America.  All of these features are observed in several other
              convergent margins globally and this focused study in the US Pacific Northwest
              will help us understand their underlying causes.
