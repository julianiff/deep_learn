The availability of metal toxicants in nature is commonly
              controlled by reactions at mineral surfaces.  Surface spectroscopies cannot
              easily determine rates of these reactions in situ and geochemists have poor
              models for ranking reactivities of oxygens at the surface of clays and other
              minerals.  This research will contribute to a better understanding of the
              kinetics of surface reactions by determining the rates of oxygen-exchange in a
              dissolved Keggin molecule [Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)127+(aq)] that has structural
              features in common with the surface of important soil minerals. The molecule
              consists of AlO6 octahedra that share edges and a single AlO4 tetrahedron.
              17O-NMR methods will be employed to determine the exchange rates of terminal
              waters and one hydroxyl site in the dissolved complex. These rates will then be
              used to estimate the reactivity of similar sites at monoatomic steps on some
              rock and soil minerals.  Some of these reactions are elementary; that is, they
              proceed as written on the molecular scale and can be used to test theoretical
              models of surface reactivities
