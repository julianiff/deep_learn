Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  ANI-9814421  PI:  Carl Malamud  Internet Multicasting Service  "The
              Internet Atlas"      This three year project is developing techniques, software
              and protocols for mapping the Internet, and then performing the mapping.  The
              project will involve  interested parties throughout the world in using its
              products to map parts of the Internet, and will then assemble the results into
              an overall view.  The project aims for maximum automation of the process so
              that the maps can accurately depict the status of this highly dynamic network.
