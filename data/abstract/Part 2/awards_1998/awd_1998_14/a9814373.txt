Madagascar was situated in the interior of Gondwana
              near the eastern edge of the east African orogen during late Precambrian to
              Cambrian time.  As the east African orogen is thought to mark the join between
              east and west Gondwana, study of rocks of this age in present day.  Madagascar
              may reveal important features essential for understanding the assembly of the
              supercontinent.  The primary objectives of this study are to determine the
              nature of the terranes, timing of terrane accretion and terminal suturing in
              the eastern margin by extensive use of isotopic and geochronologic techniques. 
              Results are expected to yield a more accurate picture of the temporal evolution
              of the east African rift, and an improved understanding of Madagascar's setting
              within the Gondwana supercontinent.
