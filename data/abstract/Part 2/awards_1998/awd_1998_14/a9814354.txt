Detailed stratigraphic sampling, comprehensive
              morphometric analysis, and fractal-based analysis of non-periodic time series
              will be combined to examine in detail the patterns and rates of microevolution
              of two Lower Devonian conodont genera, Icriodus and Ozarkodina, in Western
              North America. A new method of analysis based on random walks will be applied
              to character stratophenetic series of individual taxa to define different modes
              of microevolution. The relationship between evolutionary rate and mode will be
              examined by relating distributions of evolutionary rates to various modes.
              Finally, a model of character evolution will be constructed by comparing
              patterns of within-sample covariation to temporal patterns. Techniques, which
              maximize the quantity of information that can be derived from stratophenetic
              series, will enable us to eventually compile a database of microevolutionary
              patterns and rates for a broad range of taxa.
