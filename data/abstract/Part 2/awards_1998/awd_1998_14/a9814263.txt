The University Museum of the University of  Colorado at
              Boulder will plan a 3,000 square foot exhibit, "From Grassland to Glacier: 
              Planning for an Interactive Exhibit on Biodiversity," to replace the antiquated
              Biology Hall in the Museum which is located on the Boulder campus.  The goals
              of the project are two-fold:  1) to plan an innovative interactive exhibit
              presenting current research and pressing environmental issues to a diverse
              audience, and  2) to serve as a model for other university museums in bringing
              together researchers, exhibit specialists, undergraduate and graduate students,
              K-12 teachers, and visitors to plan an exhibit.

The planning phase will
              involve researching other exhibit projects on biodiversity that have
              successfully communicated with underserved audiences; traveling to other
              science museums to learn about exhibits on biodiversity; bringing a specialist
              to Boulder to meet with the exhibit team; assessing the baseline knowledge of
              the core concepts; meeting with prospective visitors, university scientists,
              and representatives from collaborative organizations; and drafting a conceptual
              plan for the exhibit.
