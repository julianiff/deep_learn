	The preservation of discrete screens of metamorphic rocks
              separating individual intrusions in composite batholithes is a long standing
              and inherently interesting problem that relates to how space is mad available
              to intruding magma.  Considerable effort has been directed at roof pendants
              however wall rock screens may offer considerable insights into intrusive
              processes as well, but have been little studied.  This collaborative project
              between investigators from the University of Utah, University of North Carolina
              and Boston University will study examples of pluton screens in the Sierra
              Nevada of California, where these features are well-developed and displayed. 
              Results should help understand how metamorphic screens form and what insights
              they might offer in understanding how plutons intrude the earth's crust.
