Desert pavement surfaces in the Mojave Desert region that were
              observed over a period of several decades to have been essentially free of
              annual plant growth were observed this spring to have been invaded by dense
              growths of annual vegetation.  It is inferred that this unusual increase in
              pavement biomass was due to the abnormally wet weather associated with the
              recent El Nino event.  This proposal requests support for an immediate field
              visit to affected pavement sites to document vegetation patterns and densities
              before the vegetation fades with increasing seasonal temperatures, and to
              assess any changes that may have been caused either directly or indirectly (via
              foraging animals) to the otherwise stable pavement surfaces.  A follow up field
              trip is planned for this coming fall.  The results of this field study will be
              used to determine whether surface clast patterns on otherwise stable desert
              pavement surfaces contain information about past variations of environmental
              variables such as local precipitation.
