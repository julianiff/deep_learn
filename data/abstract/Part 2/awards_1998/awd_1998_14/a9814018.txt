Abstract    :
              9814018  Eldridge    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National
              Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative,
              will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in
              grades K-12 in the Consolidated School District of Aiken County, SC.  The
              primary purpose of the grant is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics
              educators and community stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for
              mathematics education reform; study and select exemplary instructional
              materials; engage in the strategic planning of professional development; and
              identify available local, state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that
              can be coordinated in support of this mathematics reform.
