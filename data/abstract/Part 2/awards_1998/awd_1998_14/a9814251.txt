Abstract    :
                  9814251  Danyluk  An SGER award will be used to study the influence of 
              alternating electrical fields on the motion of non-metallic  abrasive particles
              in slurries.  The purpose is to  manipulating the particles and their
              interaction with a  solid surface, specifically aimed at the process of chemo- 
              mechanical polishing.  The project will take advantage of  expertise in fluid
              dynamics, materials deformation,  tribology, surface analysis, and
              chemo-mechanical polishing.  ***
