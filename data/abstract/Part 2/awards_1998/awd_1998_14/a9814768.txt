The objective of this research is to advance microstructural
              continuum modeling through an experimental analysis of regular deformation
              bands.  The results are used in modeling of deformation structures.  A goal is
              a simple predictive theory for the conditions of deformation band initiation,
              growth and subsequent effect on mechanical behavior and microstructural
              evolution.  A primary output should be macroscopic codes required in computer
              simulations of evolving deformation microstructures and textures during
              thermomechanical processing.  Variables related to deformation band formation
              that are examined include the metal alloys, slip mode, grain size, temperature,
              strain and strain rate.  The alloys selected for the study are an
              aluminum-copper binary, an aluminum-magnesium binary and an
              aluminum-copper-silicon ternary.  These are selected to provide variation in
              slip behavior and precipitate structure.

These codes should impact the
              development of processing maps of metallic alloys thereby reducing alloy
              development costs and application times.  Better understanding of aluminum
              alloys will impact their application to the new generation of transportation
              vehicles.
