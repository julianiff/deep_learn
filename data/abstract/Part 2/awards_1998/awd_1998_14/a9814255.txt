This is a one-year project to investigate the paleoethologic
              importance, paleoecologic significance and sedimentologic implications of
              composite ichnofabrics in Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) chalk deposits in
              Denmark and southern Sweden.  An ichnofabric encompasses all aspects of the
              sediment fabric, texture and structure, as well as early diagenetic phenomena
              that can be attributed to the bioerosion activities of benthic organisms.  A
              composite ichnofabric consists of a complex of biogenic structures that reflect
              the tiered arrangement of infaunal animals in a trace fossil community.  The
              research plan includes the following objectives: to determine and describe the
              spectrum of variation of the diverse ichnofabrics in the Danish and Swedish
              chalks; to decipher and explain the paleoethologic and paleoecologic
              significance of particular ichnofabrics, especially in terms of vertical
              partitioning of the extremely fine-grained substrate; to relate the recurrent
              ichnofabrics to the various sedimentary microfacies within the chalk units; and
              to produce a photographic atlas that reveals the details of composite
              ichnofabrics in the chalks.
