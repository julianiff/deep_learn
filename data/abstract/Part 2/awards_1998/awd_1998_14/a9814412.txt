Abstract    :
              9814412  Chin  This research is a short-term feasibility study to evaluate  the
              use of an acoustic wave sensor for the determination of  pathogens in food, and
              potentially, many other applications.  A quartz crystal microbalance will be
              coated with antibodies  specific for a known food pathogen, e.g., Salmonella 
              typhimurium, and the changing frequency of the crystal due  to the weight of
              the adhered pathogen cells will signal the  presence of problem microbes. 
              Ultimately, a small microchip  containing several pathogen and/or chemical
              sensors might be  inexpensive enough to include in the food packaging and used 
              to monitor the product quality from the processing plant to  the point of sale.
