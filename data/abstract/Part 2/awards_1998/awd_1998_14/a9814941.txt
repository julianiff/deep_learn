The links between subduction-zone tectonic activity and
              volcanism remain fundamental problems in geology. The object of this study is a
              volume and time-constrained analysis of a large and long-lived volcano in the
              Central Andes with a view toward evaluating the mass and heat flux in this
              classic continental subduction zone setting.
Aucanquilcha volcano and the
              surrounding cluster of volcanoes span at least 9.4 million years of volcanic
              history and constitute an erupted volume of about 170 km3. The preserved record
              of volcanic edifices from Miocene to present is unparalleled due to a prolonged
              arid climate. Compositionally and isotopically the Aucanquilcha cluster
              conforms with regional trends and so is typical of this remarkable continental
              arc. The approach to this study is: (1) to document changes in volume and
              composition in time through extensive mapping and radiometric dating; (2) to
              identify the petrologic processes and crustal reservoirs at each stage and to
              obtain a mass balance through time; and (3) to calculate the heat budget
              dictated by the mass flux and evaluate temporal variations in crustal
              thickening and mafic magma input into the crust. The emphasis is to place all
              processes in a temporal context through geologic and geochronologic data. It is
              precisely because volcanism provides sequential sampling of magmatic processes
              that the planned approach yields significant promise of addressing fundamental
              unresolved issues pertaining to magmatism in continental arc settings.
