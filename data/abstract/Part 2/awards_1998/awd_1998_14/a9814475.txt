This project seeks to collect and analyze new tetrapod
              material (both skeletal and footprint) in Norian-age (Late Triassic, 202-218
              Ma) strata of the Newark Supergroup rift basins of eastern North America as a
              prelude to understanding Triassic faunal provinciality and the
              Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. Analysis of tetrapod diversity from
              this time interval and geographic region is critical because of the unique time
              control afforded by the Newark Supergroup, particularly the Newark basin as a
              result of the NSF-funded Newark Basin Coring Project. This new material will
              allow tests of competing hypotheses concerning the rate and magnitude of the
              Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction in the continental rocks of eastern North
              America. Increased knowledge of Norian tetrapod diversity can be expected to
              not only yield insights into the world of the early Mesozoic, but more
              importantly give us a detailed understanding of the diversity patterns during
              one the largest mass extinctions of the last 600 million years. Images and
              morphological, phylogenetic, geographic, stratigraphic, and temporal databases
              will be made available through the Lamont Home Page of the World Wide Web and
              on CD.
