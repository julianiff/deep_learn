The investigators propose to develop and test global
              dynamic Earth models and regional dynamic models of subduction zones.  By
              studying slab structure at regional scales, they will constrain material
              properties of slabs, which are difficult to determine with global models.  Such
              regional models of subduction zones can also be tested with relative
              sea--level.  They propose to first develop regional spherical models for North
              America since ~ 80 Ma, the Tonga-Kermedec region since ~ 60 Ma, and the Mariana
              to Japan region since ~ 50 Ma.  They will attempt to constrain the effective
              viscosity of these subduction zones.  Using such constraints on viscosity from
              regional subduction zone models the investigators will formulate global flow
              models constrained by plate tectonic evolution since ~ 100 Ma.  Such models
              will first be tested against global tomographic inversions and then against
              relative sea--level change.
