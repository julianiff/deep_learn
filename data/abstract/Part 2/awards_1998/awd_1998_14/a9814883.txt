One of the most abrupt and dramatic global warming events
              in the geologic record took place ~55 Ma in the late Paleocene epoch. This
              event, known as the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM), coincided with
              widespread extinction of deep-sea faunas and rapid radiation in surface ocean
              and terrestrial ecosystems. The proposed four-year study will build an
              integrated reconstruction of ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere immediately
              before and at the peak of the LPTM. We will define the timing of effusive
              volcanism relative to the LPTM, and we will generate and compile extensive data
              bases related to the LPTM.  These data will be used to constrain oceanic and
              climatic conditions preceding and during the LPTM. The defined conditions will
              serve as 
boundary conditions and validation for atmospheric, oceanic and
              coupled climate models that will be used to test theories of climate change
              related to the LPTM.
