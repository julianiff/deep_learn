This award supports research on materials with strong electronic
              correlations.  The electronic states in these materials involve many strongly
              coupled degrees of freedom. Symmetry principles are explored as a
              non-perturbative means of extracting information on strongly correlated
              electronic states and of organizing the low-energy degrees of freedom in these
              materials.  The PI aims to further develop his proposal that SO(5) symmetry is
              a unifying principle of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the high
              temperature superconductors.

This award provides educational opportunity
              and supports theoretical research that seeks a better understanding of the
              phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity.  The PI will explore an
              innovative idea that he proposed and that is based on a unified description of
              antiferromagnetic and superconducting states that occur in the high temperature
              superconductors.
