	This project is aimed at an important facet to the major
              question about when the Himalaya began to uplift and make a large topographic
              expressions.  In northwestern Himalaya uplift and erosion is Middle Miocene,
              documented by coarse-grained, obvious syn-tectonic sedimentary facies. 
              However, in central and eastern Himalaya, these coarse sediments are missing. 
              The approach taken by this research is to employ the large Sm-Nd differences
              between possible source regions for establishing when detritus from each
              entered the Neogene foreland basin desposits in the Siwalik Group.  Results are
              widely applicable to Himalayan tectonics and to climatic and oceanographic
              consequences of Himalayan uplift and erosion.
