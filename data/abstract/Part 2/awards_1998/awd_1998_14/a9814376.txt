Abstract    :
              	This project represents a collaboration between Dr. Bishop and Dr. Emanuel of
              MIT who is funded under ATM-9815114.

	The project will expand work
              undertaken by the principal investigators on adaptive sampling of the
              atmosphere.   Heretofore, routine in-situ observations of the atmosphere have
              been made either from fixed locations at fixed times (e.g., by instrumented
              weather balloons) or from platforms of opportunity such as ships and commercial
              aircraft.  Adaptive sampling uses information about the current and (estimated)
              future state of the atmosphere, such as estimates of the distribution of
              analysis uncertainty and forecast sensitivity, to determine locations where
              observations would lead to the greatest improvements in forecasts. 
              Programmable observation platforms, such as manned or unmanned aircraft, are
              then directed to these special locations to make the observations.  The
              principal investigators' work to data has developed, refined, and tested
              several adaptive sampling strategies.  They will continue with these studies
              and extending to the problem of hurricane track prediction, one of the most
              important forecasting problems facing us today.  A key component of this study
              will be the exploration of data assimilation and its role in optimally
              employing these new observations in the weather analyses.  In particular, Drs.
              Bishop and Emanuel will be looking at the use of ensembles for the assimilation
              process and comparing this approach with current techniques.  In the course of
              this work, the principal investigators will employ a hierarchy of models.
