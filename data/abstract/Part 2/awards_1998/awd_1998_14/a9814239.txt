Abstract    :
              California is often seen as a model for seismic safety policy, both nationally
              and internationally.  This project has two specific objectives.  The first is
              the development of a detailed history of 12 major pieces of California seismic
              safety legislation covering more than 50 years.  The focus will be on the
              origins of the legislation and its move through the legislative process.  The
              second objective is the explication and testing of a model that takes a
              particular subset of seismic safety policy (building safety) and attempts to
              explain policy learning and evolution, especially at the state level, by
              interrelating disaster events, institutional capacity building, and policy
              innovation.  Data will be used from archives, documents, tapes and transcripts
              from an oral history source, and participant observation.
