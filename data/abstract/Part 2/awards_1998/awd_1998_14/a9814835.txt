Abstract    :
              9814835  Sala  Since the early 1900's, fire exclusion and livestock grazing in
              the interior northwest have resulted in a successional replacement of open
              ponderosa pine and western larch stands with dense stands of interior
              Douglas-fir. Fire exclusion may seriously compromise our ability to preserve
              old-growth forests in the northern Rocky Mountains. The ecological implications
              of successional forest replacement include competitive stress on the older
              trees in old-growth remnant stands, poor regeneration of species other than
              Douglas-fir, and alteration of water, carbon and nitrogen cycles. Management
              consequences include increased fire hazard, increased susceptibility to
              pathogens and decreased forest health. The Intermountain Fire Sciences
              Laboratory of the US Forest Service is planning a project to restore old-growth
              fire-dependent ponderosa pine and larch. Several treatments will be applied to
              an old-growth remnant stand (ca 450 years) which has not burned in about 100
              years: 1) control; 2) understory burn; 3) understory removal but no burn; 4)
              thinning of overstory and understory burn; and 5) thinning of overstory and
              understory removal. These treatments provide an extraordinary opportunity to
              experimentally assess changes in ecosystem properties due to fire suppression.
              The investigators will measure stand-level water use, wood production, foliage
              production, foliage nitrogen context, water use efficiency, and soil water
              availability in the five treatments before and after treatment application.
              Results will determine whether increases in stand density and canopy cover
              associated with fire suppression has resulted in an increased whole stand-level
              water use, but has decreased water used by old ponderosa pines and larches.
