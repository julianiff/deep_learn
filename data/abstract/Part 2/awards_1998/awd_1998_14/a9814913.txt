          In a number of orogens paleomagnetic orientations
              acquired during deposition have been pervasively remagneticized and during
              tectonic deformation presumably by widespread chemical remganetization as
              orogenic fluids migrated through the flanking sedimentary rocks.  The actual
              tie between postulated orogenic fluid passage through rocks and change in the
              magnetic properties of the rock has not yet been established.   This project is
              a geochemical, petrographic and paleomagnetic test of the hypothesis that such
              migrating fluids caused the observed magnetic overprints in the central
              Appalachians.  Results will place the interpretation of orogenic fluid
              remagnetization on a firmer theoretical basis and will be useful in
              reconstructing fluid flows during late Paleozoic deformation in the
              Appalachians.
