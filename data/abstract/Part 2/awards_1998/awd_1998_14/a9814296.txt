Abstract    :

     Parallel kinematic machines (PKMS) contain architectures
              that attempt to combine the dexterity of robots and the accuracy of machine
              tools.  Existing prototypes have already proved general feasibility, but they
              have also highlighted the need for concerted R&D activities in order to develop
              problem-specific technical solutions.  This forum is intended to present the
              latest efforts by American and European researchers from academia, industry and
              government labs in areas where problem-specific solutions are either not yet
              available or not yet affordable.  Among the areas to be addressed are:  (1)
              computer aided configuration tools for the design and optimization of different
              kinematics for specific applications; (2) light-weight and accurate mechanical
              joints; (3) improved linear and rotary actuators; (4) improved position
              measuring strategies; (5) control concepts; and (6) appropriate CAD/CAM systems
              for the required machine characteristics.
     To be held in Milano, Italy,
              August 31 & September 1, 1998, this forum is organized in cooperation with
              Professors F. Jovane and L. Tosatti of the ITIA-CNR Institute of Industrial
              Technologies and Automation National Research Council in Milano, Italy.   This
              forum focuses on the emerging concepts and enabling technologies for future
              manufacturing applications of PKMs.  Practically, it forms part of a strategy
              to reduce time-to-market, lower costs, and improve production flexibility for
              these kinds of machines.
