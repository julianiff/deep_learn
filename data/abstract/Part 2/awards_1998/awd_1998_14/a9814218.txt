Planning for Professional Development in Pre-school
              Mathematics is a planning grant project which involves Wayne State University
              and SUNY - Buffalo.  The project will develop a plan for the professional
              development (in mathematics) of pre-school educators.  It will involve the
              PreK-2 Standards of the NCTM Standards 2000 initiative and link with
              administrators, teachers, and caregivers in Michigan and the State of New
              York.

The project will include a survey designed to assess the professional
              development needs, focusing on content and pedagogy, of pre-school educators. 
              The survey interpretation may lead to a proposal for the development of
              professional development materials.  The project has the potential to inform
              the recently funded NSF early childhood mathematics curriculum projects. 
              

The project PI's are Julie Sarama of Wayne State University and Douglas
              Clements of SUNY - Buffalo.
