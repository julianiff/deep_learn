Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This project is the second generation analysis and modeling of
              seismological data from the Mantle Electromagnetic and Tomography (MELT)
              experiment conducted on the East Pacific Rise at 17 degrees South.  The goal of
              this analysis is to develop a comprehensive model based on models of matle flow
              and melt generation that satisfies all the different types of seismological
              data simultaneously.  There will be four phases of analysis; analyzing seismic
              data and waveform information that have not yet been exploited, inverting all
              the seismological constraints jointly to find a three-dimensional,
              self-consistent model, testing 3-D anisotropic forward models based on physical
              principles and guesses about the flow pattern, and incroporating other
              constraints, including working toward a joint interpretation with the team of
              modelers of the electromagnetic data.
