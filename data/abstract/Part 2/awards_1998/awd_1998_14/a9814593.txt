Recent developments on the Internet and 
              specifically designed course communications software are combining to make
              possible new modes of interaction between students and  instructors and among
              students.  At Brown University, in a multivariable calculus course for freshmen
              and an introductory interdisplinary course on the Fourth Dimension for students
              at all levels, the Principle Investigator and his student associates have begun
              to develop structures that allow for an expanded range of student response,
              encouraging deeper levels of participation from students who ordinarily do not
              do well in conventional timed examinations or in intense classroom or small
              group discussion.
