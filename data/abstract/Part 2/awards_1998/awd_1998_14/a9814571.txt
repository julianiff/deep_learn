Abstract    :
              This research program will develop a fully kinetic three-dimensional computer
              code, which will then be used to investigate the nonlinear evolution of lower
              hybrid waves.  Special topics that will be investigated involve the mechanisms
              for exciting the waves initially, the formation and collapse of cavities, and
              the role these waves play in the acceleration of ions in the topside
              ionosphere.
