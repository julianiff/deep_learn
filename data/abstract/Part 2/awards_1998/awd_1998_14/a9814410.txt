Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to St. Francis College
              supports the research of Professor Rose Ann Clark.  The theme of the research
              is the investigation and optimization of electron transfer in membrane proteins
              in order to gain a better understanding of their structural stability and how
              this stability affects the electron transport properties essential for energy
              transduction in living cells.  Systems to be studied include membrane proteins
              in nonaqueous media, proteins in model membranes (liposomes), and proteins
              incorporated into a two-dimensional membrane on the electrode surface.  The
              proteins in solution and the protein monolayers will be investigated using
              electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods.  These studies will help
              elucidate the mechanisms controlling electron transfer, and the results will be
              analyzed using Marcus theory.

This project is important for understanding
              processes at the interface between chemistry and biology and will also help
              advance development of the techniques used in the analyses.  Understanding the
              factors that control electron transfer in living systems should also lead to
              optimized systems for biosensors.
