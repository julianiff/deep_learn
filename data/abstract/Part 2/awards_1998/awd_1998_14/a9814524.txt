In the high-silica melts that represent granitic systems in
              moderate- to low-PT regimes, growth kinetics of quartz and alkali feldspars are
              important to the overall minimization of free energy and hence to attainment of
              chemical equilibrium during crystallization.  The central goal of this work is
              to develop a comprehensive model for the coupled nucleation and growth kinetics
              of crystalline phases from undercooled hydrous melts of haplogranite
              composition (system Ab-Or-Qtz-H2O). The project possesses two essential parts:
              a set of experiments needed to provide the basic data on nucleation and crystal
              growth in undercooled granitic systems, and a numerical model by which to
              relate the experimental phenomena to the thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport
              properties of the crystal-melt system. Key measurements sought from experiments
              will include: (1) time of structural relaxation in melt, (2) nucleation delay,
              (3) rate of change of crystal size distribution, (4) mineral modes and
              compositions, (5) onset of diffusion-controlled growth, and (6) the creation
              and dispersion of boundary layers in melt.  These data will be summarized in
              the form of rate laws, such as those we have developed for the system
              Ab-Qtz-H2O using the solution modules of Wolfram Research Software MATHEMATICA.
              The final goal of the program is to develop kinetic models that can accurately
              predict the crystallization response in undercooled granitic melts.
