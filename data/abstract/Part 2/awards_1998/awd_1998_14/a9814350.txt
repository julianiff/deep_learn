This award supports the PIs continued research efforts on
              strongly correlated electronic materials with emphasis on the high temperature
              superconductors and related 'ladder' compounds.  The proposed work involves
              lattice models for strongly correlated materials and numerical simulation. 
              There are four areas of investigation: (1) the influence of extended-range
              Coulomb interactions on the hole pairing mechanism that arises from short-range
              antiferromagnetic fluctuations, (2) the effect of extended hopping terms on the
              zero-temperature phase diagram of Hubbard and t-J models, (3) new algorithms
              for that will allow the calculation of the angle-resolved photoemission
              response for systems larger than those for which exact-diagonalization
              techniques are possible, (4) the study of models that exhibit d-wave
              superconductivity with the aim of elucidating the role of pair-fluctuations.

This award supports education and research for two investigators, one
              female.  The proposed work involves computational research on materials with
              strong electronic correlations.  An aim of this proposal is to elucidate key
              issues that have arisen in the study of the high temperature superconductors
              and their relatives.  This research also aims to develop improved computational
              algorithms and the effort will train students and post-graduates in
              state-of-the-art computational methods.
