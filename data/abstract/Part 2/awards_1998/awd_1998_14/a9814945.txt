	The  supercontinent Gondwana was being assembled during the
              late Proterozic, a time when fundamental changes were taking place in the
              earth's atmosphere, climate and biosphere.  Madagascar, then in the center of
              Gondwana, is composed of precambrian crust that was metamorphosed and deformed
              during the assembly of Gondwana. Sedimentary rocks of the Itremo Group of
              central Madagascar offer the possibility to extract pre-orogenic sedimentation
              and paleogeography in addition to assembly-related tectonics.  This study
              involves defailed lithogic and structural mapping of the Itremo Group outcrop
              belt in association with sedimentologic and petrologic analysis, with the aim
              of constraining provenance, sediment dispersal patterns, environments of
              deposition and ages of events so that a paleogeographic and tectonic model for
              central Madagascar can be constructed.  Results are expected to provide
              information on the proterozoic continental shelf environment of Madagascar and
              will contribute to understanding pre-Gondwana paleogeography and the
              amalgamation of Gondwana.
