This award is one component of a comprehensive proposal
              to drill a 4-km deep hole into the San Andreas fault. The drill site is close
              to the hypocenter of the 1966 M~6 Parkfield earthquake, where the San Andreas
              fault slips through a combination of small-to-moderate earthquakes and aseismic
              creep. The project involves about 100 scientists from the U.S. and abroad and
              would be conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the
              U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and foreign institutions.     

This
              particular project covers half of a two-part cooperative and collaborative
              pre-drilling fault-zone characterization program at Parkfield.  These two
              integrated pre-drilling projects are critical-path activities to acquire data
              that will define much of the downhole experimental program.  The goals of the
              project are twofold:  to determine the absolute locations of the drilling
              target earthquakes with sufficient accuracy and precision to assure a
              successful second stage of drilling, and to define systematics
              (space-time-magnitude) in microseismicity at small-scale (M<0, recurrence times
              of weeks to months) in the drilling target volume of the fault zone.  The
              proposed collaborative work involves (a) reanalysis of existing seismic data,
              (b) operation of a 15-station surface "calibration" seismic array, (c)
              installation of 3 new borehole stations near the drilling site, and (d)
              collaborative analysis of data from the new efforts.  This information will be
              used to determine the drilling plan and engineering specifications for the
              hole, and to optimize the experiments to be conducted in the active fault
              zone.
