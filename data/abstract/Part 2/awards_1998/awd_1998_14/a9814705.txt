Abstract    :
              Billy Joe Evans
University of Michigan
HRD-9814705
In over 25 years at the
              University of Michigan, Dr. Evans has secured significant support for
              undergraduate and graduate programs to enhance minority participation in
              science.  At the precollege level, Dr. Evans has placed more than 200
              inner-city minority high school students in authentic research settings. 
              Approximately 50 of these students are still enrolled in undergraduate programs
              and at least a dozen have earned Ph.D. or M.D. degrees from several of the
              nation's leading universities.
