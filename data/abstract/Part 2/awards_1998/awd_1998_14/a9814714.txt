Abstract    :
              Sheila E. Browne
Mount Holyoke College
HRD-9814714
As one of two women and
              the only Native American in her Ph.D. class of 140 at the University of
              California, Berkeley, Dr. Browne knows first-hand the need for, and importance
              of mentoring.  Through her efforts with the New England Board of Education, Dr.
              Browne has provided opportunities for hundreds of high school, community
              college, and undergraduate students in science.  Dr. Browne is currently
              faculty mentor for the fifty members of the student organization, Sisters in
              Science. Her performance encouraging women, particularly women of color, from
              the precollege to the doctoral level, to prepare and succeed in science is
              exceptional.
