This research involves the continuation of a fundamental
              research program in seismic tomography. Scattered wave information will be
              incorporated into ongoing investigations of upper mantle structure in the
              western Pacific.  The effects of wave scattering on global inversions of long
              period S wave travel times will be investigated using previously developed
              algorithms.  Reliable estimators for the resolution and covariance of
              tomographic images will be developed using approximate generalized inverses
              based on back-projection.  These estimators will be incorporated into schemes
              for reparametrization that minimize the artifacts of resolution heterogeneity
              in tomographic images.  Finite frequency effects in body wave travel times will
              be extended to include the "headwaves" Pn and Sn, with the ultimate aim to
              combine Pn and Sn travel times with waveform constraints on upper mantle
              structure.  New algorithms will be tested beyond the Born approximation
              (currently the scheme used) in modeling more complicated amplitude anomalies,
              such as caused by strong focusing and diffraction. The goals are to make
              significant improvements in the imaging of structural heterogeneity at short
              and intermediate wavelengths, both through a better quantification of the
              statistical properties of imaging errors, and by increasing the resolving power
              through a more correct interpretation of waveform amplitudes.
