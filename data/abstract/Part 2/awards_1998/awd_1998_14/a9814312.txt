Galapagos shield volcanoes are some of the most active volcanoes
              in the world and constitute one of the most widespread volcano types in the
              ocean basins and on other planets. The internal plumbing, the mechanisms of
              magma migration, and the role of deformation in the evolution of Galapagos-type
              shield volcanoes are all poorly known, particularly in their type locality. The
              state of strain within the volcanoes and the emplacement of magma will be
              monitored through GPS geodetic and microgravity surveys at 51 stations at
              Fernandina and Sierra Negra volcanoes. After the initial deployment, the GPS
              networks will be reoccupied annually for two years to measure surface response
              to active subsurface processes and any eruptive activity. Microgravity
              measurements will also be carried out at the same stations each year, in order
              to detect changes in the gravity signal related to internal mass
              redistribution. This integrated investigation will address: 1) the origin of
              the characteristic morphology of Galapagos-type shields, 2) the mechanisms of
              caldera collapse, 3) the strain associated with emplacement of magma, 4) the
              long-term space accommodation from repeated dike intrusions, and 5) the
              geometry of magmatic intrusions underlying calderas. The results from this
              study should provide data useful in distinguishing between competing and
              poorly-constrained models of volcano evolution, and will greatly increase our
              understanding of the internal structure and active processes associated with
              morphologic and eruptive styles of Galapagos volcanism
