	Pseudotachylyte is a type of fault rock consisting of a
              heterogeneous mixture of finely  cominuted wall rock and melt likely caused by
              high transient frictional heating during fault movement.  Although very complex
              material, it does theoretically offer the possibility of dating active
              faulting, assuming that it is produced during faulting and that some
              radiometric clock system is reset during pseudotachylyte formation.  This
              project will address this problem by investigating several isotopic dating
              systems, theoretical diffusion models and calibration techniques using natural
              and artificial material.  Results are expected to help understand
              pseudotachylyte formation and to provide insight into how it might be used to
              date  fault movements.
