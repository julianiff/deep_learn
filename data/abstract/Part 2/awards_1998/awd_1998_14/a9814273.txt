	This project will compile geological information and produce
              a new lithotectonic map of the Appalachian Orogen.  The prior highly successful
              1978 compilation has been a dynamic force behind modern analysis of this
              classic orogen.  In the context of recent strong focus on Appalachian-Godwanan
              correlations and the late Precambrian-Paleozoic global reconstructions, as well
              as the recent availability of geographic information systems technology, there
              is a pressing need for a new Appalachian lithotectonic map.  It will allow for
              more accurate and detailed global reconstructions and is expected to stimulate
              new thinking in terms of global models.
