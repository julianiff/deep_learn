This research involves the development of intermediate- and
              near-field terms for large earthquake ruptures and application of this to the
              1994 deep great Bolivian earthquake (magnitude 8.3, 636-km depth, 9 June 1994).
               Modern broadband seismic instrumentation has revolutionized seismology and
              allowed the retrieval of information in almost any frequency band of seismic
              interest.  Through serendipity, a PASSCAL portable broadband seismic experiment
              "captured" the static displacement just above the earthquake as well as very
              long period waves between the P and S waves.  These signals may be interpreted
              as the intermediate- and near-field terms of the displacement field associated
              with a shear dislocation.  Since the1994 event, more than 16 additional deep
              earthquakes have been identified which produced similar intermediate- and
              near-field terms.  Since these terms depend on the temporal evolution of the
              seismic moment rather than the moment rate (as is observed in far-field seismic
              signals), modeling these terms could provide new insights into the mechanics of
              earthquakes.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.
