Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to improve understanding of atmospheric
              photochemistry over West Antarctica, as recorded in snow, firn and ice. 
              Atmospheric and firn sampling will be undertaken as part of the U.S.
              International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE) traverses. 
              Measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) will be made
              on these samples and a recently developed, physically based atmosphere-to-snow
              transfer model will be used to relate photochemical model estimates of  these
              components to the concentrations of these parameters in the atmosphere and
              snow.  The efficiency of atmosphere-to-snow transfer and the preservation of
              these components is strongly related to the rate and timing of snow
              accumulation.   This information will be obtained by analyzing the
              concentration of seasonally dependent species such as hydrogen peroxide, nitric
              acid and stable isotopes of oxygen.  Collection of samples along the US ITASE
              traverses will allow sampling at a wide variety of locations, reflecting both a
              number of different depositional environments and covering much of the West
              Antarctic region.
