	Many questions in active tectonics involve the extent to which
              motions in the crust and underlying mantle are coupled.  Resolving these issues
              require quantitative information about crustal rheology obtained from
              observations over a broad range of length and time scales.  However most
              quantitative data collected on laboratory scales are not well correlated to
              deformation on scales that characterize the earthquake cycle, fault initiation
              and regional tectonics.  This project will model the intermediate to
              large-scale deformation of the lithosphere in oblique convergent settings,
              incorporating various failure and flow criteria, and compare model results to
              actual systems and to laboratory measurements.  The ultimate goal of this study
              is to provide constraints on the average crustal properties that control
              continental deformation.
