Title: Predictability and Variability of the Present Climate

The
              main objective of this grant research is to establish a scientific basis for,
              and to advance our understanding of the variability and predictability of the
              present climate using comprehensive and realistic models of the climate system.
               The primary emphasis is to simulate, understand and demonstrate the
              predictability of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations using coupled
              models of the atmosphere, ocean and land system.  Understanding and predicting
              seasonal-to-interannual variability requires modeling and understanding
              variability on interdecadal time scales; therefore, the PIs will investigate
              some aspects of the decadal variability and predictability of climate.
