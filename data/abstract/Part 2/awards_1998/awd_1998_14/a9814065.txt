This grant provides partial support for modernizing and
              upgrading the JEOL 8600 electron microprobe at the Department of Geology,
              University of Georgia (UGA).  The upgrade of the microprobe facility will focus
              on acquiring a state-of-the-art, PC-based automation and imaging system, to
              replace the current system that is based on workstation technology from almost
              two decades ago. The new system will provide column automation and spectrometer
              and stage control in a flexible PC-based operating environment, that is also
              inexpensive to upgrade and repair. The new system will generate fast analytical
              data output in formats compatible with personal computers. Its image
              acquisition capabilities will make it possible to generate X-ray maps, low
              magnification electron images, and mosaics of large areas, that are necessary
              in order to study large geological samples.  The electron microprobe is a key
              component in several active research programs at UGA in experimental, igneous,
              metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology (by A. E. Patino Douce, M. F. Roden, S.
              E. Swanson, J. A. Whitney and L. B. Railsback), clay mineralogy (by P. A.
              Schroeder), and archaeological geology (by. E. Garrison). In addition, the UGA
              microprobe is a regional facility, that supports work by researchers at Georgia
              State University, Clemson University (South Carolina), Auburn University
              (Alabama) and the Virginia Museum of Natural History.
