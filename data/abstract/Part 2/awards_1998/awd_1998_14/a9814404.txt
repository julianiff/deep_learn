Abstract    :
                        Abstract  EEC-9814404  Sage    The purpose of this award is to expand
              the intellectual scope of the ERC for Engineered Biomaterials by establishing a
              research collaboration with a well-renowned investigator at Wilstar Institute,
              University of Pennsylvania.  Cataracts are the primary cause of blindness. As
              most adult cataracts have multifunctional etiology, understanding of the
              regulations of lens transparency is fundamental to treatment of this complex
              disease. The primary objective of this collaborative project is to delineate
              the mechanisms underlying cataractogenesis in mice bearing a targeted
              disruption of gene encoding the protein SPARC, a critical regulator of cellular
              adhesion and proliferation.
