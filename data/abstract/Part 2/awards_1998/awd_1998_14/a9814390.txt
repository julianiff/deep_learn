The response of a magnetic substance to an applied magnetic
              field depends strongly on the physical properties of the material.  Much can be
              learned by monitoring that response through the study of hysteresis loops in
              rock and paleomagnetic studies.  As with many rock magnetic techniques,
              measurement is quick, but interpretation of the data is very complex. 
              Nonetheless, much can be learned in a short amount of time by analyzing the
              loops in an informed way.  This proposal outlines an approach for improving the
              interpretation of magnetic hysteresis loops based on numerical and experimental
              constraints.
