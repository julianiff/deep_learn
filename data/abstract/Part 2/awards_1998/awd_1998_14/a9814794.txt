The diving ability of the emperor penguin (Aptenoidytes
              forsteri), which lives within the pack ice zone of the Antarctic, has been the
              subject of interest for many years. On a routine basis, emperor penguins hunt
              for food for about two to ten minutes at depths between 50 and 500 meters.
              These birds have been recorded as reaching a depth of nearly 550 meters. The
              longest dives are not the deepest, and the record twenty-two minutes recorded
              diving duration was well below its record depth. The goals of this project are
              to understand both the physiological and behavioral mechanisms underlying the
              breath-hold capacity of these diving birds, to understand how the physiological
              limits may affect the natural diving behavior and ecology of these species, and
              to utilize the unique adaptation of diving birds to explore mechanisms of organ
              and tissue hypoxemic tolerance. This project will examine the diving physiology
              and behavior of emperor penguins in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica.
              Thermoregulation, underwater behavior and regulation of myoglobin concentration
              are three significant aspects of diving biology for which the emperor penguin
              is an excellent model of investigation of the diving physiology and diving
              behavior of diving birds and mammals.  This project focuses on the role of
              decreased body temperature in extending the duration of aerobic metabolism
              during diving. Additionally, a small camera will be utilized to examine
              behavior during diving, which will allow for a correlation between prey
              ingestion and wing stroke frequency and changes in core and muscle temperature.
              Thirdly, a molecular biology study will utilize the high myoglobin
              concentration of emperors and the large increases in myoglobin concentration
              during chick development to examine transcriptional control of the myoglobin
              gene. This project will provide an understanding of aspects of the diving
              physiology and behavior of emperor penguins, which will be applicable to
              studies of other diving birds and mammals.
