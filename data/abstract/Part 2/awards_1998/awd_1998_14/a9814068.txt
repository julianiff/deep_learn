Abstract    :
              This award supports the participation of the PI in the National Ocean
              Partnership Program (NOPP). A series of aerosol formation process studies will
              be performed in the 600 m3 Calspan environmental chamber, which provides a
              controlled environment simulating the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL). The goal of
              the NOPP studies is to substantially increase our understanding of the
              photochemical and microphysical processes controlling the formation and growth
              of aerosols in the MBL. 
	Multiple measurement techniques will be applied to
              sample a uniform volume of air subjected to a set of controlled photochemical
              conditions. Aerodyne Research, Inc. will provide a Chemical Ionization Mass
              Spectrometer (CIMS) system to measure aerosol precursors, in particular, sulfur
              dioxide, sulfuric acid, nitrous acid, nitric acid, methane sulfonic acid,
              dimethyl sulfide, and ammonia.
