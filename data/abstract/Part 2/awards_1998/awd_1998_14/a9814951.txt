Since 1979, the Times-Squared program has encouraged
              urban minority students to pursue careers in science, engineering and
              mathematics by offering several unique features.  These include a 32-hour
              elementary school curriculum to teach young children to enjoy exploratory
              science and mathematics; Saturday Academies that introduce middle school
              students to science, engineering and mathematics; and tutoring, mentoring and
              field trips for high school students.  Over 800 Times2 students have graduated
              from college.
