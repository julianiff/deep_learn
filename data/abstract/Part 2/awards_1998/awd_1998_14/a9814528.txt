The broad zone of deformation in eastern Asia encompassing
              the boundary of the Eurasian and North American plates is the least understood
              of major plate boundaries.  Recent availability of  high-precision geodetic
              (GPS) measurements in eastern Siberia, Korea, and Japan, together with
              seismological and geological data  provides the opportunity for a significant
              advance in understanding of  this enigmatic region.  To achieve this goal, the
              PI's will perform an integrated analysis of the repeated GPS measurements in
              1999 of 15-20 key sites, and a morphological analysis of high-resolution
              topographic data for the region.  They expect their geodetic analysis to
              constrain, for the first time at the level of a few millimeters per year, the
              kinematics of deformation from central Asia to western North America.  The
              pattern of deformation across these areas will help to illuminate the tectonics
              of East Asia and their relationship to subduction of the Pacific plate and the
              India-Eurasia collision.
