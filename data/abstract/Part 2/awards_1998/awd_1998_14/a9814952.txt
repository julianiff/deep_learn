The Coalition for Excellence and Diversity in Science,
              Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring focuses on the recruitment, retention and
              provision of academic support, career training, and research opportunities for
              women and minority undergraduate students. The Coalition is a truly
              collaborative cross-institutional endeavor that serves 400 students per year. 
              Minority Coalition 
participants graduated with engineering degrees at twice
              the national rate.  Chemistry and Biology graduation rates among minority
              program participants also 
increased dramatically.
