Abstract    :
              This will be the fourth in a series of National surveys of science and
              mathematics teachers that began in 1977.  A total of 1800 schools and 9000
              teachers will be included in a Nationally representative sample.  A number of
              previously used items will be repeated to provide a direct indication of change
              over time.  Emphasis in the survey will be placed on course offerings and
              enrollments, teacher characteristics and expperiences, and teacher
              practices.

Items will be also added to address new topics, particularly the
              influence of national mathematics and science standards.  In NSF's Presidential
              Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching Program to examine
              similarities and differences with the National sample of teachers.
