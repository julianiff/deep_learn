Abstract    :
              Herbert B. Silber
San Jose State University
HRD-9814702
Dr. Silber has a
              distinguished 25-year record of seeking-out and mentoring minority and
              disadvantaged students at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. 
              The focal point of Dr. Silber's mentoring activity is the laboratory.  As
              evidenced by 90 publications co-authored by students, Dr. Silber involves his
              students in significant research and supports their efforts. At the national
              level, Dr. Silber has had a 20-year involvement with the American Chemical
              Society's SEED program (Summer Educational Experiences for the Disadvantaged),
              including a very successful three-year appointment as chair of the National
              SEED Committee.
