This research involves the systematic mapping of
              scatterers in the deep mantle, in particular in the bottom 1000 km of the
              mantle where recent high-resolution tomography revealed unexpected changes in
              the planform of mantle heterogeneity.  The objectives of this research are
              threefold.  First, imaging techniques will be integrated to develop a powerful
              migration method for studies of lower mantle heterogeneity.  Second, additional
              evidence will be sought for constraints on the postulated change in bulk
              chemistry in the lower mantle.  Preliminary inversions to 1300-km depth suggest
              limited structures in the upper lower-mantle.  This work will continue this
              work into the bottom third of the mantle.  Third, by means of a combination of
              scattering and transmission tomography, improved understanding will be sought
              of the structure and dynamics of the base of the mantle.  The integration of
              the techniques of body-wave scattering with those of transmission tomography
              will better determine that gradients and amplitudes of wave speed variations
              and thus produce a new class of Earth models that place tighter constraints on
              the chemical and thermal history of our planet.
