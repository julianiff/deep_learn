Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to develop the experimental and theoretical 
methods to
              introduce multiple, heterologous, biodegradation 
pathways into a single
              organism and optimize the flux through 
those pathways for the remediation of
              toxic or recalcitrant 
organic contaminants.  The project will focus the
              biodegradation 
of parathion as a model compound since: (1) it has been widely
              
used as a pesticide; (2) it could potentially serve as a source 
for carbon,
              phosphorus, and sulfur for cell growth; (3) no single 
organism has been
              isolated that can use parathion as a sole carbon 
and phosphorus source; and
              (4) it is similar in structure to a 
number of other important environmental
              contaminants, such as 
nerve agents and other pesticides.  An engineered form
              of 
Pseudomonas putida will be used as a model organism.
