This research involves the extension of a precision earthquake
              relocation method to large numbers of events and to more diverse tectonic
              frameworks within volcanoes and active fault zones.  Work has begun on events
              following the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake.  Southeast of the main
              shock, along the transition to the creeping section of the San Andreas to the
              south, relocations comprising over 60% of the earthquake population show that
              much of the seismicity is concentrated in linear, nearly horizontal bands
              separated by regions that are presumably slipping largely aseismically.  This
              coincides with earlier indications that streaks of microseismicity aligned in
              the slip direction are a common feature of creeping faults.  Closer to the main
              Loma Prieta slip zone, focal mechanisms are more diverse and fault bends are
              encountered.  Scientific issues to be addressed by the relative earthquake
              relocation in this region include searching for fault-bend folding earthquakes,
              discriminating between the nodal planes of the anomalous focal mechanisms to
              determine the actual fault planes, and generally refining what is known of the
              distinction between aftershocks that occur beyond the main shock perimeter and
              those that occur within or adjacent to the area of mainshock slip. This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.
