Abstract    :
              Bryn Mawr College Physics Department
Alfonso M. Albano
HRD-9814949
The Bryn
              Mawr Physics Department has developed a diverse program of effective mentoring
              activities ranging from student recruitment, course strategies, research
              experiences, career counseling, and support networks that can easily be
              replicated.   In 1993-97, the college awarded undergraduate physics degrees to
              women at a rate ten times the national average.  About one-third of their
              physics graduates pursue doctoral degrees in physics or in related fields. 
              From 30 to 50 female students participate in the program every year. 
              Currently, 5% of Bryn Mawr College's graduating class consists of physics
              majors, about 100 times the national average.
