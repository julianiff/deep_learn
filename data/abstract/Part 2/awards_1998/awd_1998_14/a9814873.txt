This award supports a three year collaborative research project
              between Professor Richard Boyd of Ohio State University and Dr. Isao Tahihata
              of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Saitama, Japan. 
              The researchers will be undertaking a study of  neutron-rich nuclides in the
              mass 100 to 130 u range for nuclear astrophysics.  These experiments are
              motivated by astrophysical theories, which predict that the 
r process, one of
              the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, produces much lower abundances
              for the nuclides in the mass 100 to 130 u range than are actually observed.   
              
The researchers are attempting to produce nuclei farther from stability, and
              closer to the r-process path, than have ever been produced before, and to study
              their half-lives, decay modes, and level structures.  Measurements of their
              masses are also important, but cannot be done at present for very short-lived
              nuclei to the accuracy needed for r-process predictions.  The researchers plan
              to use the radioactive nuclear beam (RNB) facility of RIKEN to produce the
              nuclei of interest.  Although it is unlikely they will observe all the nuclei
              through which the r-process path proceeds in the mass region of interest with
              the proposed experiments, the predicted yields for the RIKEN facility suggest
              that they should come close to that region.

This project brings together the
              efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research
              capabilities.  Results of the research have the potential to produce a major
              step forward in the world's understanding of the r-process and, therefore, of
              the stellar conditions in which it operates.  This research advances
              international human resources through the participation of younger scientists
              and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this
              project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation.
