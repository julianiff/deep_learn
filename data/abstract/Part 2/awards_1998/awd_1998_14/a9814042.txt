This project will extend what is known about curriculum and
              instruction in the US and link that knowledge to test results of TIMSS-R which
              will be administered to 7th and 8th grade students in the year 2000.  Three
              lines of study are proposed:  1) examine selected NSF-funded curricula using
              the curriculum analysis method developed for the TIMSS study;  2) identify what
              curricula are in place in TIMMS-R sites; and  3) study a selected number of
              NSF-funded systemic reform sites to analyze the link between the systemic
              features of these jurisdictions teacher practices and student achievement.
