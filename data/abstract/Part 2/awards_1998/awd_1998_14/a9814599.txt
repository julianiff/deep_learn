The investigators propose to measure (under extreme
              conditions of pressure and temperature) elastic constants, equations-of-state,
              and other thermo-physical properties of candidate earth materials.  The elastic
              constants of upper mantle minerals (olivines, pyroxenes and garnets) and the
              equation of state of water will be measured to 13 GPa and 700 K.  Thermal
              diffusivities in earth materials and other simple substances will be measured
              at high pressure and temperature.  New experimental techniques will be
              developed to complete and extend the range of experiments possible in this
              laboratory.  This research provides information critical in the interpretation
              of seismic observations and in validating geodynamic theories for Earth.  The
              ultimate goal is to understand the compositional, thermal, and dynamical state
              of Earth's deep interior in order to understand its future evolution.
