	A fundamental problem in tectonics is the uplift and
              exhumation of metamorphic rocks within convergent wedges.  Of particular
              interest are the relative roles of erosion versus tectonic thinning, where
              thinning can occur by normal faulting and/or ductile flow.  This project will
              measure finite deformation across the Otago culmination in order to understand
              how erosion and within-wedge ductile flow contribute to exhumation of the
              wedge.  The Otago culmination marks the forearc high of the Torlesse
              accretionary wedge of New Zealand, and has been well-studied.  The rocks are
              preserved beneath a middle Cretaceous peneplain and a thin cover of younger
              strata which provides a datum for identifying effects of younger deformation. 
              The pattern of finite strain over the region, along with information about
              volume strains will be used to resolve middle Cretaceous uplift and erosion
              rates for the forearc high.  These results will provide a useful model for
              comparison to other convergent margin situation.
