	In naturally deformed rocks the most common planar fabric is
              cleavage.  Some of the mechanism controlling the development of cleavage are
              reasonably understood, however several important problems require insight into
              how the earliest cleavage fabric initiated.  This project's goal is to
              recognize and quantify the incipient stages of cleavage formation in mudrocks,
              prior to the development of a penetrative fabric.  The development of cleavage
              in its incipient stage in mudrocks, where there are no visible structure in
              outcrop, can be readily tracked by the magnetic anisotropy ellipsoid, and this
              project involves magnetic ellipsoid evolution in sequences of undeformed to
              cleaved rocks, which preserves the complete sequence of fabric development,
              characterization of the magnetic mineralogy responsible will be determined
              using SEM microscopy and x-ray techniques.  Results are expected to illuminate
              the acquisition of incipient cleavage fabric in the earliest stages of
              deformation.
