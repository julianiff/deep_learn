Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop a methodology using spectral transfer functions
              in order to achieve a breakthrough understanding of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
              turbulence and its applications. Transfer functions measure the strength,
              wave-number locality, and anisotropy of nonlinear couplings. Previously this
              formalism has been applied to hydrodynamic turbulence, but to date has not been
              applied to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The main effort is to use
              high-resolution numerical simulations to construct transfer function
              expressions that directly measure the strength and anisotropy of local and
              non-local wave couplings. Results will be compared with spacecraft observations
              to clarify several outstanding questions about solar wind turbulence.
