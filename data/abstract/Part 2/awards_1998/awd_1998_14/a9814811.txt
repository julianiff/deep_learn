This research involves the mapping of a feature just above
              the core-mantle boundary referred to as the ULVZ (Ultra-Low Velocity Zone).  It
              is a thin layer (less than 40 km thick) characterized by greatly depressed
              compressional and shear velocities indicating that it is probably partially
              molten and possibly chemically differentiated from the overlying mantle. 
              Inferred properties of the ULVZ make it an efficient conveyer of heat from the
              core, a shaper of the geodynamo, and a potential storehouse for deep mantle
              volatiles.  Correlation of core-mantle boundary ULVZ patches with hotspot
              volcanism at the earth's surface suggests a link to plume genesis, specifically
              that instability within or on top of the layer may orchestrate heat flow from
              the deep mantle.  To date, 44% of the core-mantle boundary has been probed for
              the presence or absence of a detectable ULVZ.  25% of the sampled core-mantle
              boundary is overlain by an ULVZ.  This work involves extension of coverage to
              new areas and more detailed investigation of previously covered areas to refine
              seismic parameters that will be useful to the mineral physics and mantle
              dynamics scientists.
