Abstract    :
              9814250

The U.S. biology community is represented by the National Acadmy of
              Sciences (NAS) in five international scientific unions:  the International
              Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS),  the International Union of Physiological
              Sciences (IUPS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics
              (IUPAB), the International Union of Microbiological Sciences (IUMS),  and the
              International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB).  There are
              two overarching issues to which the five committees of U.S. scientists who
              represent U.S. interests in these international organizations have assigned
              high priorities.  The first is the need for new, inclusive, multidisciplinary,
              and integrative approaches to biological questions.  The second is the need to
              build human and research capacity in developing countries.  This award will
              permit the NAS to continue to manage U.S. participation and assert U.S.
              leadership in these bioscience unions for an additional 36 months.  It provides
              dues payments to the five international organizations and funds to support the
              activities of the five corresponding U.S. National Committees.
