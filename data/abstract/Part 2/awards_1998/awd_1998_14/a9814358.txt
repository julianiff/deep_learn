Abstract    :
                      9814358    SMITH     UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS     The aims of this
              project are to conduct a series of ecosystem process studies at the Nevada
              Desert FACE Facility (NDFF), designed to provide an integrated description of
              responses to elevated CO2.  The particular interest at this site is on
              interactions between water and N limitations in control of desert productivity,
              and how the nature of those interactions might change under high CO2. 
              Processes to be documented include photosynthesis, above- and belowground plant
              growth and allocation, water use, and the fixation, volatilization, and
              nitrification of N.  Integration is to be achieved through development of a
              simulation model.  The location of the NDFF is the Nevada Test Site north of
              Las Vegas, operated by DOE.  The research is particularly important because
              desert ecosystems have been predicted to be among the most responsive to
              elevated CO2 and because the nature of the water-nutrient interaction is poorly
              understood and expected to be critical to understanding responses of these
              ecosystems.
