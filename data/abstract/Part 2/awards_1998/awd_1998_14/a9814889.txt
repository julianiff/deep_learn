	Evidence that large continental blocks have been subducted
              to depths in excess of 100 km, poses a challenge to present geodynamic and
              geochemical paradigms, and understanding the exhumation of ultrahigh pressure
              rocks in orogenic belts is also not well understood.  This project will examine
              ultrahigh pressure rocks in the Scandanavian Caledonides where subsequent
              tectonic overprints have not obscured the high pressure history, existing and
              new tectonic models will be evaluated by constructing
              pressure-temperature-deformation-time histories of key thrust nappes and their
              bounding faults.  In combination with data from other ultrahigh pressure
              examples, results of this work are expected to help clarify the phenomena of
              deeply subducted continental crust and its return to the surface in the context
              of subduction geodynamics.
