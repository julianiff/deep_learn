Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the development of data representation strategies when
              the available data are given in (or have been first reduced to) the form of
              numerically specified proximity information between the objects from a set
              under study.  The representation methods to be emphasized all involve discrete
              structural models that have at their basis the requirement for identifying some
              optimal form of object grouping, partition, or object sequence.  The fitting of
              these combinatorially based models can be approached through a general dynamic
              programming paradigm (GDPP) that allows the construction of recursive
              optimization routines to solve the wide range of combinatorial tasks that
              underlie the various representation structures of interest.

This research
              program will develop and extend the GDPP in four broad topic areas: (a) the
              placement and evaluation of the results obtained from the use of the GDPP
              within a statistical context; this will include defining the diagnostic
              influence of particular objects and the (lack of) uniqueness that may be
              present in the identification of a specific globally optimal result; (b) the
              incorporation of alternative measures of fit to be optimized; this will include
              alternatives to traditional least-squares loss functions and the incorporation
              of optimal scaling either at the level of the given proximity information, or
              earlier and before the proximity calculations are taken; (c) generalizations of
              the formal idea of an ultrametric which characterizes the structure fitted by
              any hierarchical clustering technique; this will include alternatives allowing
              partitions in a hierarchy to be less than perfectly nested, or that weaken in
              other ways the condition of hierarchical representation but which still allow
              convenient graphical representation; (d) evaluating heuristic extensions of the
              GDPP when faced with object sets too large to guarantee, within reasonable
              computational limits, absolute optimality for the identified structures; this
              will include comparisons to several other widely used heuristic combinatorial
              optimization approaches, such as iterative (local) improvement methods.
