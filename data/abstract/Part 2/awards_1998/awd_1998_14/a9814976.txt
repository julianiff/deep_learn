Abstract    :
                    DEB-9814976    BERRY    CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON     The aims of
              this proposal are to continue development of a method for use of radon as a
              tracer for atmospheric transport of CO2.  Field work will be done in the Great
              Plains of Southern Kansas and Northern Oklahoma.  Techniques include eddy
              accumulation and eddy covariance measurements combined with simulation
              modeling.  The research is linked to several other related projects and
              programs that relate eddy flux data to global flux data and models.  Results
              should provide a powerful tool in relating understanding of the carbon cycle at
              different spatial scales.
