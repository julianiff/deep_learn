	This research will address three aspects of problems
              related to the early history of animals: the nature of Neoproterozoic trace
              fossils and their makers; the taphonomy of modern traces and soft-bodied
              animals; and the phylogeny of basal metazoan clades. It will continue
              comparative studies of Neoproterozoic and modern trace-making organisms,
              comparative observations of body fossils and modern taphonomy of diploblastic
              metazoans, and the molecular phylogenetic analysis of the early branching
              metazoan groups. Although many investigators have assumed that Neoproterozoic
              trace fossils were made by bilaterian animals, pre-bilaterian diploblastic
              animals can make similar kinds of traces. Likewise, many modern cnidarians,
              although unskeletonized, have rigid and/or dense bodies that will form the
              basis for experimental taphonomic comparisons to some Neoproterozoic body
              fossils. Molecular sequencing of basal metazoans suggests that bilaterians are
              the sister group to placozoans, and that cnidarians are sister to these two
              groups combined. The work outlined in this proposal will test these hypotheses
              and develop appropriate new ones.
