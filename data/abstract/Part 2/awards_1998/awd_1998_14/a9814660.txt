This research focuses on understanding fundamental processes
              responsible for causing earthquakes.  Crustal earthquakes occur due to rapid
              sliding on faults.  The sliding occurs suddenly because the rocks can slide
              more easily once sliding begins to speed up, but it is not known why faster
              sliding makes rocks weaker.  Thus, the investigators are trying to understand
              why sliding is easier when it occurs faster, and why faults grow stronger as
              they sit quietly between earthquakes.  The laboratory experiments are designed
              to test some of the fundamental explanations that have been offered.  If we can
              understand the processes, the increased understanding of the earthquake process
              might show ways to predict earthquakes and to understand the factors
              responsible for their damaging strong ground motions.
