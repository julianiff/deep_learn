Abstract    :
              9814104  The Federal Communications Commission recently allocated  three 100 MHz
              bands of radio spectrum for the Unlicensed  National Information Infrastructure
              (U-NII), with only  minimal controls on radio emissions. This unprecedented 
              release of unlicensed spectrum provides fertile ground for  technical research
              on coexisting systems in a wireless  "ecology" and raises interesting policy
              issues which must be  addressed if the U-NII is to become all it's envisioned
              to  be. The WINLAB Focus '98 on the U-NII is to provide a forum  for discussion
              of a broad U-NII research agenda for both  technologists and policy makers. It
              is also intended to  provide an introduction to those with an interest in this 
              new and exciting field.***
