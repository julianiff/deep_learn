One of the most abrupt and dramatic global
              warming events in the geologic record took place ~55 Ma in the late Paleocene
              epoch. This event, known as the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM),
              coincided with widespread extinction of deep-sea faunas and rapid radiation in
              surface ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. The proposed four-year study will
              build an integrated reconstruction of ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere
              immediately before and at the peak of the LPTM. We will define the timing of
              effusive volcanism relative to the LPTM, and we will generate and compile
              extensive data bases related to the LPTM.  These data will be used to constrain
              oceanic and climatic conditions preceding and during the LPTM. The defined
              conditions will serve as 
boundary conditions and validation for atmospheric,
              oceanic and coupled climate models that will be used to test theories of
              climate change related to the LPTM.
