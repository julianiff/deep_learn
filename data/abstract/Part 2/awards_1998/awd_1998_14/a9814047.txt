U.S.-Australia Cooperative Research:  Convergence and
              Divergence in Leaf Traits

Improved understanding of convergence and
              divergence in plant traits is one of ecology's central questions.  An enhanced
              capacity to predict variation in leaf traits would be valuable for global
              change modeling.  The counterpart researchers will examine leaf traits along
              regional- and intercontinental-scale climate and soil gradients.  They will
              also synthesize global-scale data from forty sites by evaluating variation in
              leaf traits in relation to moisture and fertility gradients, functional
              groupings, and phylogeny and will develop predictive equations for traits as a
              function of climate, soils, and phylogeny.  The Australian counterpart is Prof.
              Mark Westoby, School of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney.
