Abstract    :
              Wulf  9814135    The National Academy of Engineering and the National Research
              Council's Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education propose to
              increase public awareness for the need for technological literacy.  This is
              achieved through three workshops and a symposium to define technological
              literacy, its importance to the nation and how it is best achieved. The
              workshops and commissioned papers on Teaching, Tools and Resources, and
              Implementing Technological Literacy facilitate constructive dialogue and
              information exchange among the principal stakeholders -teachers and educators
              in K-16, instructional materials developers, businesses and foundations.  The
              four interconnected challenges to achieving technological literacy are a.)
              increasing the public understanding of technology, b.) infusing K-12 teaching
              with technology-relevant curricula, materials, assessments and teacher
              resources, c.) creating stronger and more meaningful links among educators,
              policy-makers, industry leaders and foundations, and d.) effectively
              integrating educational technology into the classroom.  The outcome is a widely
              disseminated, visible, well supported document that "makes the case" for
              technological literacy and a plan for achieving it.
