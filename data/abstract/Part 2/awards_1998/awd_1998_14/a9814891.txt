This work will evaluate the source and evolution of recent magmas
              of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt.  Specifically, there is a fundamental
              question as to whether the magmas that formed the volcanic rocks have
              interacted greatly with the continental crust, or whether the mantle derived
              magmas have not interacted with the crust.  This is an old question that has
              proven difficult to answer with many isotopic systems including those of Sr and
              Nd. However, there is a potential to strongly constrain the question with a
              combined Os and O isotopic study.   Answers to this question have important
              implications to models of continental volcanic arc petrogenesis, crustal
              evolution, regional tectonics and the chemical evolution of the mantle.  The
              Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt is an excellent field laboratory to study the
              crustal contribution to arc magmatism, because the age and chemistry of the
              crust changes dramatically from west to east. The crust in western Mexico is
              Triassic in age and in eastern Mexico, the crust is early Proterozoic in age. 
              This is a significant difference that should be documented in the recent
              volcanic rocks if the magmas interacted with the crust.
