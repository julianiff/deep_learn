This research is a continuation of investigations of the
              region of the earth just above the core-mantle boundary (CMB) region known as
              D".  These include: identifying/mapping out small to medium-scale strong
              lateral variations in heterogeneity beneath the Pacific; mapping variable D"
              discontinuity structure and seismic wave speed anisotropy; discovering a
              variable thin (5-40 km) ultra-low velocity (10% slow) layer at the CMB; and
              probing seismic structure of the outermost core.  This project will address in
              increasing detail the systematics of D" anisotropy.  In addition to documenting
              patterns in travel time splits of D" traversing shear waves, there is
              compelling evidence for geographical systematics in waveform irregularities. 
              These features will be mapped and related to lower mantle heterogeneity for the
              well-sampled D" regions beneath Alaska, the northern Pacific, the Caribbean,
              Eurasia, and India/Indian Ocean.  One of the goals is to better understand the
              relationship that subducting slabs may have with D" anisotropy and structure.
