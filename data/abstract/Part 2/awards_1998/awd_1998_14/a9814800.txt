The Appalachians record is a classic example of mountain
              building, and there is present agreement that they owe this existence to
              accretion of fragments of continents and island arcs to North America during
              the Paleozoic.  However, critical aspects of the evolution of the range remain
              enigmatic or controversial, especially the actual timing of various events. 
              This project, conducted by workers at the University of Tennessee and
              Vanderbilt University, aims to provide new timing constraints for events using
              new techniques that have the potential of producing age data from regions
              having complex, high-temperature growth episodes.  These overprints can not be
              resolved with conventional techniques, but new ion probes dating of overgrowths
              on zircon crystal appear to be successful.  These new data are expected to
              answer or constrain several major uncertainties in the Southern Appalachians.
