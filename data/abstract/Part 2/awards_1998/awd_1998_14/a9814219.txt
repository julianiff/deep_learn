Abstract    :
              9814219  Metz    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National Science
              Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative, will
              focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in grades 6-8
              in Montgomery County Public Schools, Montgomery County, MD.  The primary
              purpose of the grant is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and
              community stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics
              education reform; study and select exemplary instructional materials; engage in
              the strategic planning of professional development; and identify available
              local, state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated
              in support of this mathematics reform.
