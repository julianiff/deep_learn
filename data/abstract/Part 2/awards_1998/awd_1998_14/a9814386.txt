The Delta Research and Education Foundation and the American
              Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) request $50,000 to plan a
              project titled:  Parents as Partners in Science, Mathematics and Technology. 
              The planning process will use focus groups involving 15-25 participants in
              seven geographical sites.  During the planning process, information will be
              collected to design and test an integrative model using innovative materials,
              strategies and experiences for parents to help support the work of their
              daughters in SMT content.  Further, the model will demonstrate techniques for
              use by parents with their children.  These techniques will be designed for use
              in the education of their daughters by assisting them in gaining the knowledge,
              skills and attitudes required for empowering stakeholders to advocate for
              universally available, high-quality SMT education for their children.
