Given the investments into nuclear accelerator facilities
              at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear
              Research, and especially given the excitement of the impending operation of the
              Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven, theoretical support offering
              interpretation of the physics in present and future heavy-ion experiments is
              quite important. This proposal concerns a continuing plan for theoretical
              examinations of various aspects of nuclear reactions at intermediate and high
              energies. Specific emphasis in the proposed research utilizes the Principal
              Investigator's expertise in finite temperature hadronic field theory to
              estimate particle production in nuclear collisions, with a larger goal of
              seeking to identify and explore new and practical knowledge of the collective
              response of nuclear matter to excitation far from its normal state.
              
Analytical and numerical methods will be brought together in transport
              simulations and other model development to push back limits of understanding
              and fill gaps in knowledge of strong interaction physics.  The Principal
              Investigator's specialty lies in electromagnetic probes of strongly interacting
              particle dynamics within the nuclear medium, which echoes as the central theme
              of the proposed research.
