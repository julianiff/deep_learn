The PI proposes to test the reliability of records of
              reversals from ODP advanced piston coring (APC) cores.  This is an enormous
              potential reservoir of reversals records, but there have been repeated
              suggestions that these sediment records are anomalous and cannot be relied
              upon.  The first target will be to test for radial overprints using comparison
              between off center samples and between archive and working half records of
              particular reversals.  The second stage will be to look for overprints by
              testing for antipodality in normal and reversed sections close to reversals. 
              Finally, the individual transitional samples will be subjected to AF and
              thermal demagnetization with principal component analysis.  Anisotropy of
              susceptibility and anhysteretic remanence will be used to check against the
              confounding effect of magnetic fabric on the directions recorded.  To determine
              relative intensity across the reversals, normalization will be by
              susceptibility, anhysteretic remanence and saturation isothernal remanence. 
              The result of this work will be a set of documented tests of particular
              reversal records that can be widely used to assess the fidelity of ODP sediment
              records.  The results will also bear upon the important question of the
              fidelity of relative intensity records from ODP cores.
