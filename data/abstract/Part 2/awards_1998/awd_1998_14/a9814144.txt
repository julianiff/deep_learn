Abstract    :
              This proposal is designed to study the electrodynamic coupling between the
              ionosphere and the magnetosphere at high latitudes.  In particular, it will
              examine the coupling during periods when the interplanetary magnetic field
              (IMF) is northward.  The dynamics of the ionospheric convection and the
              variation in the field-aligned electric currents (FACs) will be examined as the
              IMF By component varies.  Images from the POLAR satellite will be combined with
              particle measurements from POLAR as well as particle and magnetic field
              measurements from the DMSP satellites.  These data sets will be used to
              determine the field-aligned currents and the ionospheric conductivity.  The
              information on the currents and ionospheric convection can then be used to
              determine the way energy is coupled into the ionosphere from the magnetosphere.
