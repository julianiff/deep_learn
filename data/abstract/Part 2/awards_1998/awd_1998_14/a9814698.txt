The CD-ROM (Continental Dynamics-Rocky Mountain Transect)
              project is an integrated geological and geophysical investigation to evaluate
              lithospheric structure in a transect from Wyoming to New Mexico.  The project
              has been funded for the time period 1998-2001.  The project involves 17
              investigators from 12 universities. One of the major goals of the CD-ROM
              project is to understand how Laramide structures may have been influenced by
              older continental assembly structures and how Laramide upper crustal shortening
              is accommodated in the lower crust and upper mantle.  

The Principal
              Investigator of this project is a recognized expert in Laramide tectonics.  His
              studies will strengthen the CD-ROM project by carrying out detailed analyses of
              Laramide structural geometries and sequences of events along the CD-ROM
              transects.  This is important to the success of the project because the effects
              of Laramide tectonism must be identified to discriminate their signatures from
              those of older (Precambrian) and younger (Rio Grande rift) events that have
              also contributed to the present lithospheric structure of the western part of
              the North American craton.  In addition, he can provide valuable advice to the
              project about exactly where to site the seismic lines in the transects so as to
              maximize information about Laramide basement-involved intracratonic
              tectonism.
