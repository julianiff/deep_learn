Abstract    :
                                9814223  Nutter    This planning grant, which is part of a
              joint National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8
              mathematics initiative, will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching
              of mathematics in grades K-12 in the five communities which make up the Maine
              School Administrative District #40.  The primary purpose of the grant is to
              facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community stakeholders in
              order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education reform; study and
              select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the strategic planning of
              professional development; and identify available local, state, and federal
              resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in support of this
              mathematics reform.
