We hypothesize that Paleo Vertisols, which are clay-rich
              paleosols exhibiting abundant evidence for extensive shrink-swell processes,
              contain important paleoclimate information that is generally underinterpreted
              by geologists.  Paleoclimatic studies based on paleosols are hindered by lack
              of diagnostic climate indicators determined from thorough studies of
              climosequences in modern soils.  We therefore propose to examine modern
              Vertisols in the Coastal Prairie region of Texas along a climatic transect in
              order to characterize the distinctive morphological and chemical features that
              correlate well with climate.  Important soil-forming factors such as parent
              material, landscape, and time are held as constants, so that the importance of
              mean annual precipitation, which ranges from 60-140cm/yr across the study area,
              can be evaluated.  Utilizing the diagnostic morphological and chemical features
              that we identify in the modern Vertisols, we will return to previously
              well-characterized paleo Vertisols occurring within the Appalachian basin
              Paleozoic stratigraphic succession in order to reevaluate their paleoclimatic
              significance.
