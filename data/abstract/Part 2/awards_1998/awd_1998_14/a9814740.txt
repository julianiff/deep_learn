Abstract    :
              Aubrey Gorbman
University of Washington
HRD-9814740
Dr. Gorbman truly
              pioneered the concept of "science mentoring of women" by effectively advising a
              significant number of Ph.D. female students and postdoctoral associates at a
              time of significant underrepresentation.  Dr. Gorbman has been retired for 12
              years, and yet continues to keep as active as that experienced mentor that
              young researchers are happy to find.  Over a span of 25 years, he advised 50
              postdoctoral associates (13 of them women) and 16 Ph.D.s (9 women).  Most of
              these women have made significant contributions to the field of research and
              are considered to be role models.  Dr. Gorbman founded and meticulously edited
              the Journal of Comparative Endocrinology for 32 years.  He included in the
              editorial board both women and minorities.
