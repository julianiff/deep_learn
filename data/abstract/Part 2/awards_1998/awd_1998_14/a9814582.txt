The Water Science and Technology Board (WSTB) and Board on
              Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) of the National Research Council (NRC)
              propose to form a new committee to undertake a program of studies in hydrologic
              science.  The studies will identify research needs and provide scientific
              advice on the hydrologic aspects of multi-disciplinary U.S. national programs
              and U.S. contributions to international programs related to climate and
              biogeochemical cycle research.  The initial focus will be on the role of
              hydrology in the climate system, and the implications of climate and water and
              land cover change for the hydrologic system.  It will cover the observational
              (both long-term and short-term) aspects, measurements, and analysis components
              of these programs.

The activity is proposed for duration of 36 months
              initially, with the likelihood that further authorization and funding will be
              sought as additional activities in the hydrologic sciences are identified.  The
              initial phase of this study will result in a report providing an overview of
              the general hydrologic content and an assessment of research priorities for the
              U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) based on the committee's work
              during the first 12 months.  At the end of three years, a second more detailed
              report of the analyses undertaken in years 2 and 3 will be provided.  It is
              expected that the reports will help better focus the work of hydrologists and
              global change researchers so as to produce maximum value and information to the
              USGCRP.

The estimated total cost of this activity over the 36-month study
              period of July 1, 1998 through June 30, 2001 is $472,000, of which 150,000 will
              be required for the first year, July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999.  This
              request is submitted to the National Science Foundation, which is requested to
              serve as the administrative lead for several federal agencies (NSF, National
              Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration, U.S. Geological Survey and others) in supporting the proposed
              activity.
