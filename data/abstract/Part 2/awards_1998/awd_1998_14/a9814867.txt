	The middle Cenozoic post-collisional northward motion of
              India relative to Eurasia and South China was accommodated in a variety of
              ways, and has been extensively studied along the northern boundary.  The
              eastern boundary is more complex because it is an area where the strain field
              has evolved rapidly with large magnitude clockwise rotations and limited SE
              extrusion.  This project will test the hypothesis that crustal fragments
              between the Gaolingong shear zone, which accommodates most of northward
              movement of Indian along the eastern margin, and two NW-trending faults were
              vertically extruded by transpression tectonics.  This study will provide basic
              data on the structural evolution of the neglected eastern plate boundary of the
              India-Erasia convergent system.  On a larger scale, this study will contribute
              to how the India/Eurasia system on the west interacts with the Pacific/Eruasian
              system on the east during middle Cenozoic time.
