Variations in the geomagnetic secular variation of
              Earth's magnetic field come from dipole and nondipole sources.  There is little
              agreement as to the origins of these sources.  The PI plans to carry out
              detailed analyses of paleomagnetic secular variation data and magnetic field
              reversal data to help resolve the differences in viewpoints expressed by
              different scientists.  A more coherent picture of the nature of the changes in
              Earth's magnetic field with time and their relationship to geodynamo theory
              will be developed.
