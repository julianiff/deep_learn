The goal of this proposed research is to test the hypothesis
              that voltage induced by applying ultrasound in the presence of high magnetic
              fields can be used to map the electric properties of tissues.  This may provide
              a means to generate real time images of the electrical parameters, with spatial
              resolutions similar to diagnostic ultrasound.  Applying this method may be
              particularly valuable in breast cancer imaging since breast tumors give rise to
              large variations in tissue electrical parameters.
