Description:  This award is entitled US-India Cooperative
              Research: Chemical Weathering in Granitic Channels of India and the United
              States.  Principal investigators Ellen Wohl and Sally Sutton, Colorado State
              University will collaborate with Indian geologist, Hema Achyuthan, Anna
              University, Chennai.  The primary objective of the research is to obtain
              fundamental knowledge about the means by which channels are incised into
              bedrock and the role that chemical weathering plays in this process.  The
              investigators will study chemical weathering of granite bedrock within active
              fluvial channels in subalpine through semiarid to subtropical climates in India
              and Colorado.   

Scope:  This research has the potential to contribute
              substantially to the fields of geomorphology and geochemistry by furthering
              understanding of the chemical weathering of bedrock and its implications for
              landform development.  It will foster collaboration and intellectual exchange
              among geological communities in both countries and provide opportunities for
              joint field research, laboratory analyses, and seminars.  This is a new
              collaboration among three female scientists at the early stages of their
              careers and fully supports the objectives of the Division of International
              Programs.
