Abstract    :
              9814297    Steele        Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic   
              Institution will allow U.S. ocean scientists, in the academic   research
              community, to participate in activities of the   International Council for the
              Exploration of the Sea (ICES)   and the Scientific Committee for Oceanic
              Research (SCOR),   which are of particular interest to the ocean sciences  
              community, to the National Science Foundation and other   Federal agencies, and
              to ICES as well.  ICES is an    intergovernmental organization designed to
              coordinate    scientific research, management of fisheries, environmental   
              concerns, and oceanographic matters of common interest to    countries
              bordering the North Atlantic. SCOR serves primarily   as an organization to
              facilitate international collaboration   of ocean research through the
              formation of working groups on   various marine topics.  Under this award  U.S.
              academic   research scientists will participate in selected ICES and SCOR  
              activities in 1998-2000.
