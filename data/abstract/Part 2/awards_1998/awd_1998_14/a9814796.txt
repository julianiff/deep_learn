The PIs propose to conduct a series of experiments and
              microstructural measurements to understand the evolution of pore structure and
              permeability during hydrothermal compaction.  The research will focus on
              studying the effect of triaxial stresses on the pore structure of calcite rocks
              that deform by plastic flow or by solution transfer processes.  Compaction
              mechanisms and the effect of fluid chemistry on pore structure and transport
              properties will also be investigated.  An important comparison will be made
              between experiments on aqueous systems and those done using argon, an
              essentially inert pore fluid.  They will quantify the changes in pore size
              distribution and pore connectivity in relation to porosity decrease during
              densification using SEM and laser confocal microscopy.
