Abstract    :
              AT&T

Throughout its 25-year history, the AT&T
              program has had a significant impact on the number of women and minority
              master's and doctoral degree recipients in science and engineering resulting in
              increased diversity in the science and engineering workforce.  The AT&T program
              combines financial assistance with a mentoring component drawn from the AT&T
              labs.  Summer research opportunities are provided for students to prepare and
              motivate them to pursue graduate degrees in the science or engineering fields. 
              Once enrolled in graduate programs, AT&T mentors continue to work with students
              and to provide career guidance.   Approximately 300 students have been
              supported through the AT&T program.
