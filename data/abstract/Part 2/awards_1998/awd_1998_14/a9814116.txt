Abstract    :
              This project is an experimental study of the hygroscopic growth properties of
              organic carbon-containing aerosols.  The studies will involve the generation of
              aerosols with a range of organic and mixed organic/inorganic compositions and
              characterization using a Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (TDMA) coupled
              to a Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter.  The experimental system includes a
              Scanning Electrical Mobility Spectrometer allowing detailed measurements of the
              fine aerosol size distribution in a time scale of seconds and the ability to
              produce internally or externally mixed aerosol.  The properties of organic
              aerosol produced during the photo-oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons will be a
              major focus of the proposed work.
