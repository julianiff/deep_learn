The Association of Science Technology Centers (ASTC)
              will develop "Accessible Science Museum Practices:  A Demonstration and
              Training Project."  Addressing the need to improve and expand communication
              among museum professionals and local disability communities, ASTC will develop
              a program that includes training workshops, developing "Accessibility Guides,"
              and expanding a Web site with information about museums and accessibility.  The
              audience for this project is science museum professionals committed to
              providing access to families with children and youth with disabilities.
