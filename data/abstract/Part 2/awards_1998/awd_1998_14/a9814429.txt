When two tectonic plates converge in a direction that
              is not perpendicular to the boundary between them, there are shear forces
              generated between the plates acting parallel to the boundary.  If this
              convergence occurs along a gently-dipping thrust fault then the upper plate may
              be, and very often is, deforming rapidly.  In many cases the part of the upper
              plate that rests on the subducting plate gets torn and moves along the margin,
              separated from the rest of the upper plate by a margin-parallel strike-slip
              fault.  In this study the P.Is. will examine the factors that control this
              process and from this will gain an improved understanding of the forces acting
              on the margin as well as the material properties of the Earth.  They will
              compile information on the process of strain partitioning globally as a guide
              to numerical computer experiments that simulate oblique subduction.  The main
              goals are to understand what measurements of deformation in this setting can
              tell us about the forces and rheology  in convergent margins and also to
              understand in general terms the factors that produce strike-slip faults.
