Abstract    :
              9814331  Nagy    This award will partially support attendance, especially for
              graduate  students and new investigators, at the conference "Linear Algebra: 
              Theory, Applications, and Computations," to be held at Wake Forest  University,
              Winston-Salem, North Carolina, January 8--9, 1999.   The conference intends to
              recognize Robert Plemmons' outstanding   contributions to core, applied, and
              computational Linear Algebra on   the occasion of his sixtieth birthday.    
              The major themes of this conference will be: matrix analysis and  nonnegative
              matrix theory; large, sparse least squares problems and  parallel algorithms;
              applications of linear algebra in signal and  image processing.  The primary
              purpose of the meeting is to bring  together scientists researching in these
              diverse, yet related areas,  to explore greater commonality.  There will be
              four invited long  presentations, and twenty-five invited short presentations. 
              In order  to facilitate interaction between researchers with varying interests,
               there will be no parallel sessions.  Contributed papers will be  solicited for
              informal poster presentations, and new investigators  will be especially
              encouraged to participate.  The conference will be  held in an intimate setting
              to encourage interaction between  researchers, and between senior scientists
              and new investigators.  Research results presented at the meeting will be
              published in a  special issue of the journal Linear Algebra and its
              Applications.
