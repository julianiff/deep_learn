This proposal requests support to continue long-term
              investigations of the fluvial geochemistry of the large pristine rivers in the
              Russian Far East, east of Lake Baikal.  The objective is a comparative study,
              using existing results from the Tropics and this survey, on the influence of
              climate on weathering rates, specifically the C02 consumption rates by
              aluminosilicate degradation, OC02 in moles/kM2/yr.  None is found!  Since all
              models of paleo-climate on geological time-scales assume a very strong
              relationship, -x IO over the -30'C range examined (only summer temperatures
              included), the results are dramatic and unexpected and therefore controversial.
               It is proposed to continue this work in the Amur, a relatively uncontaminated
              Temperate river, on remote streams in the Far East that drain its extremes,
              including the Kamchatka Peninsula and the high Arctic, and on the headwaters of
              the Olekma and Vitim (major right-bank tributaries of the Lena) that have
              sources in the Trans-Baikal Highlands east and south of Lake Baikal and may
              provide the closest analogues to the basement terrains already sampled at
              Tropical latitudes in the Amazon, Orinoco and Congo and to eroded
              Iiimalayan-type collision zones.  The parallel program on minor and trace
              element geochemistry will continue.  The studies of the geochemistry and
              petrology of the river sands will be carried on by collaborators at no cost to
              this proposal; water, suspended and bed load samples will be distributed to
              qualified investigators in the US and overseas in the usual manner
