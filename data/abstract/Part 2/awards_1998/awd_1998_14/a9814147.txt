Abstract    :
                      This project will construct a Laser Surface Mapping System (LSMS) for
              use on ALVIN or ROV's such as Jason.  The LSMS can provide detailed,
              quantitative orientation and morphometric data on a wide variety of seafloor
              features.  A laser line scanner rapidly produces a digital z-y-z map of
              targeted surfaces from which 3-D images can be produced.  It is intended that
              this tool will become a part of the permanent array of equipment that will be
              available to users of deep-submergence systems.
