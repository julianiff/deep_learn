Abstract    :
              9814275  Burleigh  To hear properly, the brain must integrate information about 
              sounds coming to the two ears.  This binaural nature of  hearing often means
              that sounds are laterally asymmetrical;  acoustic properties like intensity,
              arrival time and  waveform phase can be different between the two ears.  This 
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research builds on an unexpected  and novel finding
              that such asymmetric input in the auditory  system can have effects on motor
              control.  This is an  exploratory high-risk study because the initial finding
              has  not yet been clearly established, but if it is, this will be  a
              high-impact result for neuroscience and biomedical  engineering.  The
              objectives of this work are to develop  tests to assay the hearing thresholds
              to binaural  differences for subjects with auditory pathway disorders in  the
              brainstem, to analyze walking gait and speech quality of  normal and abnormal
              subjects during presentation of  binaurally different sounds, and to develop a
              refined  audiological assistive device to compensate for this  auditory
              dysfunction.    Programs in Biomedical Engineering and in Neuroscience are 
              jointly funding this project because the impact of these  results will be very
              high on understanding sensorimotor  integration and on developing possible
              clinically effective  electronic devices for certain motor control disorders.
