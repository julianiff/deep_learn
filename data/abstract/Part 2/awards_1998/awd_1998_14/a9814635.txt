This grant provides support for development of a 36 node,
              dual-processor PC cluster (a Beowulf cluster) to be used in computational
              geophysical research at Princeton University.  The Beowulf cluster will
              facilitate parallel processing of 3-D mantle convection models, seismic wave
              propagation models and geodynamo simulations  at finite element resolutions
              that have only been achievable elsewhere using supercomputers.  This 36 node PC
              cluster at Princeton will be the very first Beowulf cluster ever developed that
              will be devoted to geophysical modeling and not computational science and
              promises a significant price-performance advantage over state-of-the-art
              parallel architectures.
