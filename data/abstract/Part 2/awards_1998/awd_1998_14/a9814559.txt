Of the volcanic gases, sulfur dioxide (SO2) has the
              greatest potential for climatic impact due to its direct injection to the
              stratosphere during explosive eruptions, its slow conversion to submicron H2SO4
              aerosol and long residence time in the stratosphere.  H2SO4 aerosol loading
              resulting from the climactic 6845+/- 50 yr. B.P. eruption of Mt. Mazama, Crater
              Lake, Oregon is estimated at 2 x 10^14 grams,  approximately one order of
              magnitude more than was released during the recent eruption of  Mt. Pinatubo,
              yet there have been no previous studies of the source of sulfur in Mazama
              magmas. Sulfur isotopic data will be used to delineate the source(s) of
              dissolved sulfur in Mazama magmas based on the characteristic isotopic
              signatures of the Earth's sulfur reservoirs (i.e., mantle, crustal,
              meteoric/hydrothermal) and quantification of isotopic shifts which may have
              occurred due to extensive degassing. Objectives of the proposed research
              include: 1) testing the hypothesis that elevated d34S values in Mt. Mazama
              tephra are the result of open-system degassing; 2) quantifying the amount of
              sulfur that degassed from the volume of erupted magma; 3) experimental
              determination of sulfur isotopic fractionation factors at magmatic
              temperatures; and 4) demonstrating the applicability of sulfur isotopic data to
              characterize degassing style in ancient tephra.  Most importantly, stable
              isotopic data obtained in this study will delineate the likely source(s) of SO2
              released by past explosive volcanism and will contribute towards our
              understanding of sulfur recycling between the mantle, crust, hydrosphere and
              atmosphere.
