Abstract    :
              	Dr. Renno seeks to identify the relative importance of various mechanisms that
              may be responsible for the large-scale variability of the tropical atmosphere. 
              In addition to evaluating a number of theories of mechanisms that affect moist
              convective waves (such as wave-CISK and WISHE), he will also explore a new
              theory of his own, Asymmetric Opacity Instability.  His strategy is to employ
              different cumulus parameterization schemes as a means of eliminating certain
              mechanisms from a particular simulation.  The various mechanisms will be
              examined in relation to tropical waves in general, and the Madden-Julian
              Oscillation in particular, in a series of idealized GCM simulations.  If time
              allows, the PI also intends to compare his model results with ECMWF gridded
              analyses.

	This project will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Isaac
              Held of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
