Abstract    :
              This award supports a program of high resolution radar profiling of the snow and
              ice stratigraphy beneath the traverse routes in West Antarctica that will be
              part of the U.S. component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific
              Expedition (US ITASE).   A coherent, short-pulse radar with a 400 MHz antenna
              will be the primary tool.  The system will allow real time monitoring in a
              horizontally scrolled display and will provide exceptional vertical resolution
              (tens of centimeters) and a penetration depth on the order of 50-70 meters. 
              The primary analysis tool will be simple data compression (stacking), which
              will reveal subtle deformational features and long distance trends.  Advance
              crevasse detection will be one useful operational aspect of having this system
              along as part of the ITASE traverses.  Isochronal continuity will be
              interpreted from the continuity in reflection horizons between core sites.
