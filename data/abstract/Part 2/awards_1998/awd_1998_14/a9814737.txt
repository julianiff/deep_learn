Operating at
              ten UNC campuses, MSEN employs a pre-college program for students and a teacher
              professional development component to enhance K-12 science and mathematics
              student achievement.  Operating since 1984, the MSEN program has an annual
              enrollment of nearly 3,000 7th and 8th grade students and 5,000 teachers. 
              About 1,000 MSEN participants have graduated from high school.  In 1994, 65% of
              the MSEN participants who graduated from college pursued a math or science
              related major.
