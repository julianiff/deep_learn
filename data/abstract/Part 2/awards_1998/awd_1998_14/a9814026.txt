Abstract    :
              9814026  Mangel  One of the most important members of the Antarctic food web  is
              the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba.  Besides being a  food source for many
              species of seabirds and marine mammals,  krill also forms the basis of an
              important commercial  fishery.  Since the First International Symposium on
              Krill  was held in 1982, many research projects have addressed  issues of krill
              distribution, abundance and biology.  The  purpose of this symposium is to
              review current knowledge of  krill biology, to highlight gaps and future areas
              for  research and to show how the comparative study of different  species of
              krill can illuminate more general problems (for  example, krill flux,
              recruitment, swarming behavior, age and  growth).  The symposium will focus on
              the functional aspects  of krill biology, rather than krill distribution,
              abundance  and behavior in different environments. An international  group of
              scientists will participate in the symposium and  results will be published in
              the peer-reviewed scientific  literature.  This symposium will advance the
              field by  providing new synthesis and insight into current research  and by
              providing direction for the future.
