Abstract    :
              Science competitions for K-12 students represent a significant adjunct and
              supplement to the formal science and mathematics instruction that students
              receive in school.  Yet almost no evaluation of the impacts of these
              competitions exist.  The Georgia Science Olympiad proposes to carry out an
              evaluation of its activities over three years that will examine program
              activities and the impacts on students, including standardized achievement and
              student attitudes.  Results will be disseminated to Science Olympiad
              participants throughout the country and to the science and mathematics
              communities.
