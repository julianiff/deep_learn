Abstract    :
              Real-time IP routers that provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees is a
              fundamental building block for Next-Generation Internet, which promises
              differentiated service levels that are independent of external
network loads
              and enforced on a connection-by-connection basis.  Although a large body of
              theoretical work in the past decade has resulted in >advances of our
              understanding of the complexity of various real-time packet
scheduling
              techniques, relatively little research has gone into the implementation aspects
              of building such routers. This project proposes to study in depth
              software/hardware implementation techniques for high-performance scalable
              real-time packet routers. Specifically, we plan to focus on the following three
              issues: routing-table lookup, real-time packet scheduling, and systems support
              for and applications of the concept of active networking.  The project
              directors  are going to carry out the proposed research with an experimental
              approach by building a software-only parallel real-time IP router called Suez,
              which is constructed out of a cluster of high-performance commodity PCs
              connected by a Gigabit/sec system area network. The goal of the Suez project is
              to evaluate the feasibility and performance behavior of the proposed
packet
              routing and scheduling implementation techniques in a fully operational
              prototype, and to demonstrate that with the help of efficient software support,
              off-the-shelf PC components can be interconnected to build multi-million
              packets per second scalable real-time packet routers.
