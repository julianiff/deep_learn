              Abstract  ATM-9814063  Johnson, Thomas C.  University of Minnesota  Title:
              Climate-sediment Linkages in Lake Malawi, Africa During ENSO    This SGER award
              supports measurements of water temperature profiles  and sediment particle flux
              to the floor of Lake Malawi at the  southern end of the East African Rift
              Valley.  It is critical that  this be accomplished as the very strong El
              Nino-Southern  Oscillation (ENSO) of 1997-1998 winds down.  The project has a 
              severe urgency with regard to being quick response research to a  natural
              phenomenon.  Circulation dynamics and sediment trap studies  in Lake Malawi
              will have direct implication for high resolution  studies of past climate
              change in tropical Africa, based on the  analysis of varved sediments from Lake
              Malawi.  This work will  provide essential baseline information for the IDEAL
              project.
