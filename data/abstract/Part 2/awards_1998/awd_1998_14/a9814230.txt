The MHD energy bypass engine to be analyzed in the proposed
              research project was defined by the ANSER research team that developed an
              advanced SSTO concept as part of the NASA Highly Reusable Space Transportation
              (HRST) program.  The MHD energy bypass engine design concept is an unique
              magntchydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass augmented air-breathing ejector ramjet
              engine.  This research project will include a higher order analysis focused on
              the critical elements of the engine design concept.  The simulation will model
              the plasma and the magnetic field interaction of both MHD generator and the MHD
              accelerator.  To optimize the performance of the engine and stabilize the
              interaction between the magnetic field, boundary layer, and the plasma in the
              MHD channels, a learning neural network control system will be defined and
              incorporated into the computer code to analyze the engine cycle and determine
              the performance of the engine.  Textron Systems have design codes used to
              design MHD systems similar to the proposed MHD ejector ramjet engine. 
              Princeton is developing MHD accelerator codes as part of their current
              hypersonic windtunnel formulation and evaluation program.

This project will
              fund the first stage of what is hoped to become a multi-year effort by a
              cross-disciplinary team to address control, MHD and design issues, both in
              simulation and in new experiments.
