Over the past 115 My a significant fraction of the eastern Indian
              Ocean seafloor was formed by magmas derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume. 
              The overall goal of this research is to use this volcanic record to understand
              the origin and evolution of the Kerguelen mantle plume.  This is an important
              objective because magmas derived from mantle plumes provide information about
              physical and chemical processes occurring in the earth's mantle that cannot be
              obtained from study of volcanism associated with diverging and converging
              plates.  Specifically, mantle plumes provide information about convection
              processes in the mantle, and the effects of long-term recycling of crust into
              the mantle.  The Kerguelen Plume is particularly important because: (a) it is
              long-lived; (b) all aspects of plume-related volcanism are accessible for
              study; i.e., a very large igneous province (Kerguelen Plateau) which is
              commonly associated with plume initiation, a long hotspot track of volcanoes
              (Ninetyeast Ridge) which formed as the Indian plate migrated rapidly northwards
              over the plume, and a large, recently active oceanic island (Kerguelen
              Archipelago) located on the Antarctic Plate; (c) lavas associated with this
              plume have a distinctive geochemical signature which reflect recycling of crust
              into the deep mantle; (d) formation of the large igneous province in the newly
              formed relatively small Indian Ocean may have enabled dispersal of these plume
              geochemical characteristics into the Indian Ocean asthenosphere, thereby
              creating the distinctive geochemical characteristics of basalts erupted at
              currently active seafloor spreading centers in the Indian Ocean; and (e) the
              high magma flux reflected by the mid-Cretaceous formation of the Southern
              Kerguelen Plateau may have significantly affected the earth's
              hydrosphere/atmosphere system. Geochemical and age data for igneous rocks from
              the Kerguelen Archipelago and submarine Northern Kerguelen Plateau will be
              obtained in order to understand the source and evolution of the <40 My
              volcanism related to the Kerguelen Plume.
