Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
              Office of Polar Programs, supports vertebrate paleontological research in the
              Transantarctic Mountains. Antarctic field work, to search for and collect new
              terrestrial vertebrates of Triassic and Jurassic age, will be conducted in the
              austral summer of 1999-2000. During this season, exposures of the Feather and
              Lashly Formations in southern Victoria Land will be explored with the support
              of helicopters operating from McMurdo Station. Field efforts will concentrate
              on finding exposures equivalent to the Hanson Formation that has produced the
              only Jurassic dinosaur fauna from Antarctica and searching for new middle to
              upper Triassic fossil vertebrates. In addition to collecting new fossil
              specimens, an interpretation of the taphonomic/depositional settings for each
              of the localities will be made. The preparation and study of the vertebrates
              will occur during the second year of this project and will include
              investigation of the evolutionary significance of the member taxa of these high
              latitude Mesozoic faunas. Antarctic vertebrates of several different ages
              spanning the Triassic to Jurassic that have been discovered in recent years
              provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of high latitude faunas.
              These faunas also contribute to our understanding of high latitude climates
              during the Mesozoic.
