The California Science Center will develop an exhibition,
              "Abracadabra:  The Science of Illusion."  This will be a 6000-sq.ft. traveling
              exhibit.  The theme, the science behind magic, will help visitors understand
              that magic is based on the complex interplay between sensation, perception,
              physical science and math concepts, culture, and the art of performance. The
              goal of the exhibition is to use the public's fascination with magic as a
              bridge to learning basic science in the area of optics, electromagnetics,
              simple mechanics, math, physiology and psychology.  The exhibit will include
              seven thematic sections and an enclosed theater for live and taped
              performances.  The exhibition will open at the California Science Center in
              October, 2000 and then will travel to the six science centers that participate
              in the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative.  It is estimated about 4 million
              people will view the exhibition during its national tour.
