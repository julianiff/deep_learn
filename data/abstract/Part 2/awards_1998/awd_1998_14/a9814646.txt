The Exploratorium will develop an exhibition entitled "
              Traits of Life:  Exploratory Exhibits in the Life Sciences".  There will be two
              versions.  The first will be a 4,500 sq.-ft. exhibit that will include about 35
              life science interactive modules and will be installed at the Exploratorium. 
              Following an evaluation period, about 20 of the exhibits will be used for a
              3,000 sq.-ft. traveling version of the exhibition.  The Association of Science
              and Technology Centers will manage the circulation of the exhibition. 
              Challenging visitors to consider the question "What is Life?" this exhibition
              will be designed to offer learners new ways to explore characteristics shared
              by all living things.  Three traits have been selected to illustrate the
              characteristics common to all living things:  a shared molecular and cellular
              structure, self-reproduction, and adaptation to surroundings.  These traits
              will be reflected in three sections of the exhibit:  "A Common Design",
              "Passing It On" and "Staying Alive".  Complementary elements include
              artists-in-residence, scientists-in-residence, teacher institutes, student
              materials, web-based activities, public programs and publications.  Project
              staff will attempt to develop an understanding of techniques that are most
              successful in stimulating learning about life science in informal settings.
