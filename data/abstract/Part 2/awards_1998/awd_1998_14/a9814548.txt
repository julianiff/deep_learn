Partial melting of preexisting materials of the continental
              crust (anatexis) is an important process leading to long-term crustal
              differentiation and to the generation and evolution of evolved magmas in a
              number of important tectonic settings. Various isotope systems are commonly
              used as tracers of anatectic processes and source compositions, but the success
              of this approach depends on an assessment of  equilibrium during partial
              melting in the continental crust.  However, recent experimental and field
              investigations suggest that the assumption of isotopic equilibrium may not be
              valid for anatectic melts generated in some crustal environments.  The
              objective of this project is to contribute to our understanding of the isotope
              systematics of Sr during dehydration melting of muscovite, biotite, and
              hornblende-bearing crustal assemblages.  The Sr isotopic compositions of
              experimental partial melts segregated from their source using diamond
              aggregates will be measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometry.  This
              technique provides a unique opportunity to investigate (1) the isotopic
              evolution of anatectic melts as a function of reaction progress and mineral
              stabilities and (2) mechanisms and time scales of melt-source equilibration
              during the generation and segregation of crustal melts.
