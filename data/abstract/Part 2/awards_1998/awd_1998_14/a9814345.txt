Abstract

This is a study of one pathway to polychlorinated
              dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), namely their
              formation from chlorophenols in the presence of catalytic surfaces.  A
              differential flow reactor packed with "model" fly ash or fly ash from a
              municipal solid-waste incinerator is used.  Realistic concentrations of
              chlorophenols are used.  The role of oxygen is quantified, and mechanisms of
              formation of PCDD/F tested.

Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans (PCDD/F)
              are among the combustion byproducts produced by municipal solid-waste
              incinerators.  They (or at least some of the isomers produced) are among the
              most toxic materials known; their control should be a public health priority. 
              This research looks at the mechanism of their formation in order to establish
              approaches for control.
