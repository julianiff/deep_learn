The primary goal of the proposed work is to identify the scale
              or scales of the processes that control melt transfer in migmatitic rocks. This
              information will allow the production of realistic models of transport
              properties of migmatites with respect to melt, which will serve to perfect
              integrated numerical models of melt segregation and migration within, through,
              and out of migmatitic rocks. Specific steps will include: 1) the
              characterization, using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography, of the 3-D
              distribution of leucosome in a migmatite (as a proxy for mesoscopic melt
              advection network) from the Onawa contact metamorphic aureole; 2) the
              derivation of mesoscopic permeability estimates from deterministic models of
              flow through the network defined in 1; 3) the characterization of
              inter-leucosome compositional gradients (i.e., in mesosome) within that
              migmatite, using the electron microprobe analyzer and image analysis
              techniques; 4) the derivation of bulk diffusivities associated with these
              gradients by applying appropriate analytical solutions to the diffusion
              equation, as well as error minimization methods; 5) comparison of the resulting
              rates of inter-leucosome material transport with rates of melt advection in the
              leucosome network, in order to identify the scale or scales of the processes
              that control the overall movement of melt through these rocks; and 6)
              assessment of different types of spatial distribution models for transport
              properties of migmatites, in light of these results. Developing models of melt
              transfer in migmatites is a necessary step in understanding crustal-scale melt
              transport because any geometric model of focussed granite ascent requires
              extensive migration of material through the source region.
