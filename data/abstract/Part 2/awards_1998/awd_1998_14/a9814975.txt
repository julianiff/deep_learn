By David M. Mickelson and Paul Cutler (Department of
              Geology and Geophysics, University of Wisconsin, Douglas R. MacAyeal
              (Department of Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago) and Patrick M.
              Colgan (Department of Geology, Northeastern University).  We will reconstruct
              the dynamics and subglacial environment of the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet
              (SLIS) during the late Wisconsin by integrating the glacial geologic record
              with numerical ice-sheet modeling.  We focus on the SLIS because there are
              striking contrasts in landform assemblages from north to south, and the record
              of ice sheets is well documented in time and space.  Data will be organized and
              analyzed in a geographic information system.  Our ice-sheet model is
              two-dimensional, time-dependent, and incorporates the upper 1-km of the
              subsurface in addition to overlying ice.  The model will be adapted to handle
              basal/subsurface processes by adding a 'geologic package'.  This will include
              treatment of permafrost, hydrology, basal motion and till dynamics. This
              modeling will help us understand the conditions of formation of the glacial
              landscape of the Great Lakes area.
