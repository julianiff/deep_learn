This project
              is a continuation and expansion of a hydrology study of the Kuparuk River
              watershed in northern Alaska.  Previous results show that changes in Arctic
              drainage networks in response to climate change may lead to biogeochemical
              changes affecting tundra ecosystems.  The slow change and interannual
              variability of the hydrologic processes in response to climate warming requires
              a long-term project to elucidate climate/hydrology process and temporal trends
              during the past decade during which there is evidence warming air and soil
              temperatures.  A combination of field work, analysis of satellite imagery, and
              modeling will be used to examine the factors leading to changes in network
              geometry, soil moisture, snow melt, and other factors that affect nutrient
              availability in the tundra ecosystem.  The study is an integral component of a
              long-term, group study of climate, soil, and biologic processes controlling
              tundra ecology in the Kuparuk watershed, particularly the ecological response
              to a climate warming.
