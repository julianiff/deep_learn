Abstract    :
              EEC-9814162  University of Minnesota  Francis A. Kulacki    The 1998
              International Conference on Engineering Education (ICEE) to be held in Rio de
              Janeiro, Brazil is a follow up to ICEE '97 sponsored by Southern Illinois
              University, the National Science Foundation and National Cheng Kung University,
              the Technical University of Strata, and the U.S. technical societies ASME and
              IEEE.  After ICEE '97, working groups have carried on a continuing dialog
              through e-mail to fulfill their commitments to share courseware and other
              educational information, and to deepen the collaborative ties.  This proposal
              will provide partial travel support for 20 U.S. participants to the conference.
                 The proposal in intended to facilitate collaboration of engineering
              educators from different parts of the world in order for all parties to benefit
              from what is learned in the various countries.  This is judged particularly
              important at this time when the practice of engineering is becoming a global
              profession.    In the selection of the recipients of the travel grants a
              special effort will be made to assure that the recipients include a significant
              number of younger faculty so that they may gain experience in international
              activities.  The awards for partial travel support will go principally to those
              who do not have travel funds from their local sponsored activities, such as
              work in the NSF coalitions.
