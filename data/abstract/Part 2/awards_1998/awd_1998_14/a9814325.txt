Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9814325       HUCKABAY, JOHN  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS    The project
              takes advantage of the presence of an icebreaker in the Beaufort Sea that is
              supporting the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project and the
              presence of a US Navy nuclear submarine in the same vicinity to conduct an
              exploratory research project.  A sound source on the ship will be used to
              transmit a seismic signal to the seafloor that will be recorded onboard the
              submarine.  The seismic signal will be utilized to determine the crustal
              structure of the Amerasia Basin. This will be the first time that a submarine
              has been used for seismic reflection and refraction studies and could pave the
              way for an entirely new means of collecting high-quality data to resolve
              important geological and tectonic problems.
