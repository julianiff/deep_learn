This planning grant, which is part of a joint National
              Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative,
              will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in
              grades 4-8 in Southwest Georgia and the Chattahoochee/Flint Regional
              Educational Services Area districts.  The primary purpose of the grant is to
              facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community stakeholders in
              order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education reform; study and
              select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the strategic planning of
              professional development; and identify available local, state, and federal
              resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in support of this
              mathematics reform.
