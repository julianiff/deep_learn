Abstract    :
              Time-discrete one- and two- dimensional sequences and arrays find applications
              in signal processing and as aperture functions for electromagnetic and acoustic
              imaging. Applications of two dimensional perfect binary arrays are found in 2-D
              synchronization and time-frequency coding. These are also used
in channel
              coding and cryptographic coding. This research involves the study of perfect
              arrays and their related mathematical objects. Wide-band digital
              communications, optical signal processing, radar and audio coding are other
              disciplines that have applications of these objects.

The conventional binary
              case { +1, -1} as the alphabet. The investigator extends the alphabet to the
              ternary and quaternary cases: the corresponding alphabets being {0, +1, -1} and
              {i,-i,+1,-1}. Here i denotes the complex fourth roots of unity. The problems
              studied pertain to perfect binary arrays, perfect ternary arrays, perfect
              quaternary arrays, almost perfect arrays and periodic complementary sequences.
              The investigator studies these via their algebraic formulations viz. difference
              sets, supplementary difference sets and divisible difference sets. New
              structural theorems will be proved using character sums
of group ring elements
              over suitable abelian groups. These results would enable to produce new classes
              of sequences and arrays with desirable correlation properties.
