Understanding the origin and geochemical characteristics of
              the mantle lithosphere beneath the continents is central to deciphering the
              processes responsible for mantle differentiation and continental crust
              formation. The primary goal of this research is to provide new information and
              insights on a variety of mantle processes; most importantly the formation and
              evolution of low density, high Mg/Fe peridotites that may form an isostatically
              stable mantle lithosphere beneath continental cratons. This goal will be
              achieved by a combination of laboratory and field studies including (1) trace
              element and isotopic analysis of minerals in mantle xenoliths from Tertiary
              dikes in the Weidemann Fjord area in Southeast Greenland and Ubekendt Island in
              West Greenland, (2) comparative studies of samples of similar peridotites
              worldwide (Papua New Guinea, Wyoming craton, and the Kapvaal craton), and (3)
              additional collection of peridotite samples from Greenland. The new data will
              be used to evaluate two hypotheses previously based on major element
              compositions of the same samples: (1) xenoliths from Weidemann Fjord and
              Ubekendt Island, with low modal orthopyroxene, are examples of unmetasomatized
              cratonic peridotite, formed as the residues of about 40% partial melting, and
              (2) orthopyroxene-rich cratonic peridotites, such as those in the Kapvaal and
              North American cratons, were produced by open-system, SiO2 enrichment of highly
              depleted residues.
