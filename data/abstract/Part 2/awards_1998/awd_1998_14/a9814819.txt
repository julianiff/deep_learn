The goal of this proposal is to study the fundamental chemical
              properties of deep mantle and core materials at the relevant pressures and
              temperatures in order to obtain experimental information on the chemical
              composition, formation, and evolution of the planet's interior. The project
              takes advantage of numerous new developments in high-pressure techniques,
              including synchrotron x-ray diffraction, x-ray spectroscopy, infrared, and
              optical techniques, as well as laser heating diamond-cell methods. Fundamental
              bonding properties of key materials will be investigated with these methods,
              focusing particularly on the behavior of transition-metal oxides at deep mantle
              and core pressures.  This will be extended to high pressure-temperature studies
              of phase transitions, phase relations, and element partitioning of deep mantle
              silicates and oxides.  The behavior of volatile components at very high
              pressure-temperature conditions will be examined.  New techniques will be used
              to study phase relations, including melting of natural and model multicomponent
              materials. Finally, phase transformations, structures, and phase diagrams, of
              iron and iron alloys will be studied.
