	There is considerable interest in the role of water in the
              earthquake rupture process, but modern example are very difficult to study. 
              Pseudotachylytes (friction melts) represent one of the few paleoseismic
              indicators in the rock record that may record aspects of the role of water
              during the rupture event that caused the partial melt.  This study will use
              Mossbauer spectroscopy to assess the oxidation state of iron in opaque minerals
              found in several well characterized pseudotachylytes which serves as a proxy
              for oxygen fugacity in the corresponding paleoseismic zones.  If is anticipated
              that Fe +2/ Fe +3 ratios at individual localities will reveal local variations
              of oxygen partial pressure and permit the role of fluid compartmentalization in
              active fault zones to be evaluated.
