Title: The
              Paleoclimate Record in Sediment Cores from Lake Issyk Kul, Kyrgystan

This
              award supports the analysis of sediment cores  recovered from Lake Issyk Kul,
              Kyrgystan.  Ostracode assemblages in four of these cores will be analyzed for
              paleoclimate based on oxygen and carbon stable isotopes, trace element
              composition and faunal abundance of the ostracode assemblages.  Issyk-Kul is
              located on the edge of the Tien Shan Mountains in Kyrgystan, at an elevation of
              just over 1600 m.  It is in a region of the Asian continent where good
              paleoclimate records are scarce and much needed.  The key questions to be asked
              relate to the timing and intensity of climatic change in this remote region of
              central Asia over the last 10,000 years.
