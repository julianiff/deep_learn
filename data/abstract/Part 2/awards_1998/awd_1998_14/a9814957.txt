ABSTRACT: The Shape of Life is a major new documentary
              series that will take viewers on a journey to explore the kingdom of animals
              through the blueprints or body plans that shape every species alive today. 
              Each episode will incorporate current advances in genetics, developmental
              biology, and evaluation, presenting them in a manner that is accessible to the
              lay audience.  The series has been developed by the Sea Studios Foundation and
              is a co-production of Sea Studios Foundation and National Geographic
              Television.  The eight, one-hour television programs will be supported by a
              consortium of informal science institutions that will implement ancillary
              programs in partner museums, zoos, and aquaria and by outreach materials,
              including print and a web site.

Mark Shelley, President of Sea Studios, and
              Nancy Burnett, CEO of the Sea Studios Foundation, will be co-Executive
              Producers of the series.  Chuck Baxter, Professor of Biology at Stanford
              University, will be the Science Content Director.  Science advisors include: 
              Richard C. Brusca, Marine Biology Graduate Program, University of Charleston;
              Mimi Koehl, Department of Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley; Jane Lubchenko,
              Department of Zoology, Oregon State University; Rudolf A. Raff, Indiana
              Molecular Biology Institute; and Dennis Willows, Director, Friday Harbor Marine
              Station, University of Washington.
