This research will explore how crystals of nanometer
              dimensions (nanocrystals) grow, and how rates and mechanisms of subsequent
              reactions are affected by particle size. Nanocrystalline materials are products
              of chemical weathering and microbial biomineralization and account for much of
              the reactive surface area in weathered rocks, soils, and sediments. The
              modified stability and reactivity of nanocrystals is also of significance to
              materials science. Recent experimental work on coarsening of nanocrystalline
              materials has revealed that under a subset of conditions, particles grow by
              crystallographically oriented attachment. This largely unrecognized mechanism
              involves reduction in surface energy by direct elimination of surfaces. 
              Research will examine the importance of coarsening by oriented attachment in
              nature and will quantify the effects of this mechanism on reaction kinetics. 
              Experimental work will continue to use the convenient and important TiO2 system
              and characterization studies will primarily involve high-resolution
              transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The product of this
              work will be new understanding of kinetics in the nanocrystalline size
              domain.
