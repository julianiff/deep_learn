The proposed research will enhance our knowledge of the
              history of eustatic, (or global) sea-level changes over the last 100 million
              years.  This information is critical in earth-science studies because eustatic
              sea-level change is the datum against which all tectonics is measured.  It is
              also an indicator of continental glaciation and of large changes in ocean
              generation and continental orogeny.  Finally, if short-term sea-level change
              (=0.5 - 3 m.y. variations) can be shown to be eustatic, and dated then it could
              be used for global correlation at a scale finer than that of most
              biostratigraphic methods.  The detailed analyses of boreholes drilled in the
              New Jersey coastal plain in conjunction with offshore sequence stratigraphic
              analyses and offshore well data provide an unprecedented data set for analysis
              of both long-term and short-term sea-level changes.  By performing
              backstripping analyses of these data, we expect to make major strides in
              assessing the reality of short-term eustasy and it's magnitude, while at the
              same time providing very important feedback on the implications of
              stratigraphic interpretation as they are made.  Previous work has shown that
              the data obtained from these types of boreholes (ODP leg 150X) is sufficient to
              obtain magnitudes of short-term (0.5 - 3.0 m.y. duration) sea-level events. 
              The new wells will verify or complicate our understanding of the middle to late
              Cenozoic record, extend eustatic (global sea-level) estimates back to the late
              Cretaceous, and extend sea-level (regional) estimates to the middle Cretaceous.
               The results of this work will be critical to studies of offshore sequences and
              studies of sea-level changes of this age in many other margins.
