Abstract    :
              This award supports a two year project to study the oxygen-isotopic composition
              of air in the Vostok and GISP2 ice cores.  Photochemical reactions in the
              stratosphere lead to isotopic exchange between O2 and CO2.  They introduce an
              anomalous "mass independent" signal in the isotopic composition of atmospheric
              O2 in which d17O varies as much as d18O.  Photosynthesis and respiration
              consume anomalous O2 and replace it with isotopically normal O2 in which d17O
              varies half as much as d18O.  At particular times, there is a small
              mass-independent signal in the isotope composition of atmospheric O2.  Its
              magnitude depends on the relative rates of photochemical reactions in the
              stratosphere and photosynthesis and respiration by the global biosphere. 
              Analysis of samples from the Vostok and GISP2 ice cores will give a record of
              how gross production of the biosphere varied during major climate events
              associated with glacial/interglacial climate cycles.  This record will
              contribute to our evolving understanding of the nature of interactions between
              climate and the land and ocean biospheres.
