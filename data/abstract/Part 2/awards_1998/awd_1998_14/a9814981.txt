Abstract    :
              This research involves constructions of combinatorial objects called Ramanujan
              graphs that are special types of expander graphs that have a vast number of
              applications to several areas of computer science and communication science and
              to many other areas of research (e.g., reliable communication networks, sorting
              networks, super-concentrators, construction of highly efficient
              error-correcting "expander codes").  This investigation connects  expander
              graphs to codes, sequences 
and exponential sums, three fundamental areas of
              communication science that are already deeply connected, and that already have
              many important applications in: the correction of errors in transmission and
              storage of data (e.g. to CD's), fault-tolerant systems, secure data
              communication, and cryptography.     

The investigators have recently
              introduced notions of projective coset graphs of codes and have constructed
              Ramanujan graphs and other good expander graphs from codes, sequences and
              related exponential sums that appear as eigenvalues of these graphs.  Research
              thus far has shown that good codes and 
sequences lead to good expander graphs
              in general, and Ramanujan graphs in particular. Also, some exponential sums
              that appear in the construction of Ramanujan graphs and good expander graphs
              lead to  very good codes and sequences.  The investigation involves: i) a vast
              extension and generalization of the  work done so  far; ii)  construction of 
              Ramanujan graphs and other good expander graphs from algebraic geometric codes,
              codes over Galois rings, and other classes of codes; iii) practical and
              
feasible applications of these graphs to the research areas mentioned above;
              and iv)  discovery of new areas of applications. In addition, the investigators
              analyze the highly practical research work  of the last fifty years  in coding
              theory, sequence design and related exponential sums for  efficient
              implementation of the proposed schemes.
