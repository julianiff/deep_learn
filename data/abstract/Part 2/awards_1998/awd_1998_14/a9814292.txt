The Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron is an outlier in
              the distribution of geomagnetic polarity chron lengths.  During the Superchron
              the field was of apparent constant normal polarity for approximately 37 million
              years.  This has led some authors to propose the geomagnetic field has two
              fundamental states: one in which the field reverses and one in which the
              reversal process ceases.  Against these well-founded inferences is the mounting
              evidence for one or more brief (less than 100 kyr) intervals of reversed
              polarity, called reversal events, during the Superchron.  The evidence for
              reversal events includes recent paleomagnetic data from the Rajmahal Hills of
              eastern India.  However, it is unclear from the available data whether
              reversals actually occurred.  In addition, the reported directions could record
              a geomagnetic excursion rather than a true field reversal.  The proposed work
              addresses these questions through a field program in eastern India coupled with
              laboratory studies, including paleomagnetic, rock magnetic and radiometric age
              analyses.  If confirmed, the reversal event in the Rajmahal lavas represents a
              fundamental conflict between model predictions and observations with
              implications for the generation of the geomagnetic field.
