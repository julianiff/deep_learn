	In a number of orogens paleomagentic orientations acquired
              during deposition have been pervasively remagneticized and during tectonic
              deformation presumably by widespread chemical remganetization as orogenic
              fluids migrated through the flanking sedimentary rocks.  The actual tie between
              postulated orogenic fluid passage through rocks and change in the magnetic
              properties of the rock has not yet been established.   This project is a
              geochemical, petrographic and paleomagnetic test of the hypothesis that such
              migrating fluids caused the observed magnetic overprints in the central
              Appalachians.  Results will place the interpretation of orogenic fluid
              remagnetization on a firmer theoretical basis and will be useful in
              reconstructing fluid flows during late Paleozoic deformation in the
              Appalachians.
