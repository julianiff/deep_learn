Tamae Wong, National Academy of Sciences

The U.S. mathematical
              and phycial sciences communities are represented by the Naitonal Academy of
              Sciences (NAS) in seven international scientific unions:  the International
              Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Radio Science Union (URSI), the
              International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the International
              Commission for Optics (ICO),  the International Union of Pure and Applied
              Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), and the
              International Mathematical Union (IMU).   U.S. National Committees  (USNC's),
              staffed by the NAS, will:  lead U.S. preparations for meetings of the
              corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, 
              and workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues,
              and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support
              U.S. scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of
              U.S. dues to the seven unions.  Two overarching objectives of this activity are
              to: (a) forge new or stronger relationships within the U.S. research
              communities to engage them more fully in international scientific challenges
              and opportunities; and (b) build new synergies among the USNC's for the seven
              unions to develop cross-disciplinary activities and address common
              international issues in the mathematical and physical sciences.
