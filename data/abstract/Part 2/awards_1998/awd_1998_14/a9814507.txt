Abstract    :
              Monson  9814507    Studies will be conducted to develop a new technique for
              capturing air  drafts above a forest canopy. The air drafts will be captured in
              such a way  that we can accurately analyze the stable isotopes of carbon and
              oxygen in  carbon dioxide molecules. The relative fractions of the different
              isotopes  will allow us to separate and study the magnitude of soil respiration
              and  photosynthesis within the forest ecosystem. These studies, in turn, will 
              allow us to determine how much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is being 
              accumulated in the forest (i.e., the photosynthesis minus respiration), and 
              whether future changes in climate will affect this accumulation by  stimulating
              respiration more than photosynthesis. In this proposal, the PIs  will only test
              and develop the technique. The funds will be used to support  three campaigns
              at different times of the year in an oak-hickory forest in  western Tennessee.
              Future efforts will be aimed at applying the technique  to different types of
              ecosystems. With this technique, the PIs will be able  to better assess the
              role of forests in the global carbon balance.
