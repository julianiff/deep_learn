This action phases out the operation and maintenance of a
              Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer for various atmospheric constituents at
              McMurdo Station, and an emission spectrometer for nitrogen compound
              measurements at South Pole Station.  The database developed over the years
              includes concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous and nitric oxides,
              chlorine nitrate, hydrogen chloride, and other trace elements active in the
              chemical destruction of stratospheric ozone.  The utility of the information
              has decreased because the chemistry of the seasonal ozone destruction is now
              known quite well, and the tracking and monitoring of atmospheric constituents
              is being done by the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory with its
              observatory at South Pole Station.  

This project is jointly supported by
              the NSF's Office of Polar Programs and Division of Atmospheric Sciences.  The
              funds will be used to analyze existing data on the nitric acid distribution
              over South Pole Station.
