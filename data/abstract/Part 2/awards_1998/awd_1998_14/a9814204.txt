Because of the enrichment of Re relative to Os in
              mantle-derived, basaltic partial melts, and the high Re/Os ratio of crustal
              rocks, the Re/Os isotopic system has proven to be a sensitive tracer in the
              evaluation of dynamic interaction processes between crust and mantle-derived
              mafic magmas.  In the assessment of country rock contamination the application
              of the Re-Os isotopic system as a petrologic tracer is dependent upon the
              proper evaluation of open- or closed-system behavior in the contaminant rock,
              and immobility of Re and Os after crystallization of the igneous rock or
              sulfide-rich ore material.  This project will evaluate the distribution and
              isotopic characteristics of Re and Os in organic-rich sedimentary rocks,
              changes in isotopic characteristics during contact metamorphism and conversion
              of these rocks to hornfels, and isotopic variation found in sulfide-bearing
              igneous rocks produced as a result of assimilation of country rocks or a
              released fluid phase.  The geologic setting of the Duluth Complex and
              Proterozoic country rocks presents an excellent opportunity to trace the
              evolution of the Re-Os system through the processes of contact metamorphism and
              dehydration, and assimilation of country rocks by mafic magma.  Both
              crustally-contaminated and uncontaminated gabbroic and troctolitic rocks are
              present in the area of the Babbitt Cu-Ni deposit, and systematic Re-Os analyses
              will permit an in-depth evaluation of the causes of isotopic variability that
              may originate as a result of metamorphic and hydrothermal processes in the
              country rocks, and magmatic processes related to changes in the ratio of
              silicate magma to sulfide magma.
