Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: CMS-9814023, Poul V. Lade, Johns Hopkins U.    This action is to
              support an international workshop on the physics  and  mechanics of soil
              liquefaction. The objective is to exchange  information,  knowledge, and ideas
              about current investigations into the  processes of  instability and
              liquefaction of soils resulting from earthquake-  induced  strong ground
              motions. Emphasis is placed on experimental research  and the  workshop will
              concentrate on understanding the liquefaction  phenomenon  under static and
              cyclic loading.    The Workshop will bring together experimentalists in the
              field of  soil  liquefaction to review current knowledge, to present recent 
              findings, and  to exchange ideas on research in the areas of instability and 
              liquefaction.    A fundamental understanding of the liquefaction process is 
              necessary to  improve criteria and methods for predicting the collapse of 
              saturated  soils, to enhance the triggering analysis, to develop mitigation 
              measures,  to evaluate the effectiveness of practical remedial techniques,  and
              to  ultimately improve current design recommendations.
