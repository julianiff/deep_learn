Abstract    :
              An international seminar on self-stabilization is supported with  the goal of
              establishing the state of the art in this field and  setting the course for
              future research.  The seminar, to be held  August 17-21, 1998 in Wadern,
              Germany, focuses on practical  applications of self-stabilization in the
              design, control, and  maintenance of fault-tolerant distributed systems and
              computer  networks.  It brings together forty researchers including  leading
              figures in the self-stabilization community, as well as  selected young
              researchers and students.  Its format makes it  possible for participantsto
              give more in-depth presentations than  is customary at conferences; it also
              includes problem-solving  sessions and panel discussions.
