Recent syntheses of the global paleomagnetic database
              for Vendian and Cambrian time (600-500 million years ago) have led to
              provocative hypotheses that true polar wander (TPW) may have occurred during
              that interval, at sustained rates of >30 cm/yr--far exceeding those of the last
              200 million years.  Careful paleomagnetic analyses of well preserved
              Vendian-Cambrian rocks can provide direct tests of the TPW hypotheses.  This
              project will conduct such analyses among suitable geological formations in
              Australia, Quebec, and Siberia.  The results, whether verifying or disproving
              the TPW hypotheses, will have important implications for global geodynamics, as
              well as for improving understanding of the tectonic environment surrounding the
              Cambrian "explosion" of animal life.
