Abstract    :
              Women in Engineering Initiative (WIE), University of

In 1989, WIE served 50
              women; today it serves over 1,300 students a year on the University of
              Washington campus and over 3,000 students off campus  
by providing mentoring
              activities aimed at increasing the number of women in science and engineering. 
              Between 1990 and 1997, the WIE program has increased 
retention rates among
              undergraduate women from 50% to 74%.  WIE research on mentoring has also
              produced a nationally-disseminated cross-gender, cross-racial 
curriculum for
              training mentors and mentees in science and engineering.
