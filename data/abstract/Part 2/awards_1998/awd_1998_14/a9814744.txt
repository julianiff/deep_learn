Abstract    :
              D. Allan Butterfield
University of Kentucky
HRD-9814744
Dr. Butterfield has
              built an excellent record producing doctoral and master's students, many of
              them women.  He has managed to continue supporting students at all levels over
              the years and helped 20 students from Appalachia to pursue successful graduate
              work.  Through his research projects, Dr. Butterfield affords many
              underrepresented undergraduates and graduate students the opportunity to
              experience groundbreaking laboratory research.  Of Dr. Butterfield's many
              students, five females earned doctorates and eight earned master's. Four
              females are currently pursuing doctoral degrees and one is pursuing a master's
              degree.
