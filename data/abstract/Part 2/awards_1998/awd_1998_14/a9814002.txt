Title: Workshop on Integrated Assessment, July 9-11, 1998;
              Washington D.C.

The Association of American Geographers (AAG) will organize
              and host a workshop of approximately one hundred participants on Integrated
              Assessment (IA) in Washington, D.C. on 9-11 July to: 

o	highlight research
              progress related to the field Integrated Assessment;
o	involve researchers
              from related scientific communities in discussions of the role of integrated
              assessment in global change and other topics of basic science
              inquiry;
o	discuss the role of integrated assessment in meeting the goals of
              the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP); and
o	solicit
              recommendations from the scientific community on the future of federal research
              investments in integrated assessment and related fields.

The workshop will
              help answer questions related to future directions for IA research and its
              explicit role in helping to meet USGCRP goals. The meeting will meet that need
              by drawing together researchers and scientists who have been involved in
              USGCRP-sponsored IA research, federal scientists and program managers, and
              members of the scientific community working in related specialties. The
              workshop is important, especially given past federal sponsorship of Integrated
              Assessment research and the need to define more precisely a role for Integrated
              Assessment in the federal investment portfolio. The workshop will be especially
              valuable for the USGCRP, which now plays a direct role its role in conducting
              assessments related to global environmental
              changes
