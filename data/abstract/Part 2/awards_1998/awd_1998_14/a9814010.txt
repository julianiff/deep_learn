Abstract    :
              ESI-9814010    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National Science
              Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative, will
              focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in grades K-8
              in 69 school districts in Northeast Arkansas.  The primary purpose of the grant
              is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and community
              stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics education
              reform; study and select exemplary instructional materials; engage in the
              strategic planning of professional development; and identify available local,
              state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated in
              support of this mathematics reform.
