Abstract    :
              Armando A. Rodriguez
Arizona State University (ASU)
HRD-9814738
Soon after
              his arrival six years ago at ASU, Dr. Rodriguez developed a mentoring program
              entitled MoSART (Modeling, Simulation, Animation, and Real-Time Control) that
              cuts across the entire spectrum of undergraduate education reaching into the
              job market and graduate school.  Through the program, Dr. Rodriguez has
              influenced more than 80 students to complete their degrees in a timely manner
              and to take advantage of opportunities such as internships, publications and
              conference activities.  Dr. Rodriguez has also directed 10 master's and 2 Ph.D.
              recipients and is currently supervising 10 additional graduate students.  Dr.
              Rodriguez has put forth an excellent example of an innovative approach to
              mentoring that can be replicated elsewhere.
