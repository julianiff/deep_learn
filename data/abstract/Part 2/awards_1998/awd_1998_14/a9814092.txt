Abstract    :
              The objective of this project  is to develop analytical tools that could be
              applied to genomic sequence information in order to predict the complete
              phenotype of an organism. This research is a combined effort between
              investigators at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Harvard
              University (HU). The research will involve a dynamic interaction between
              algorithm development and mathematical representations of phenotypes (in silico
              analysis) and experimentally determined patterns of gene expression and growth.
              The in silico work will be performed at UCSD and the experimental work will be
              performed at HU. The three specific goals outlined are: (1) to develop
              algorithms that can use bioinformatic data bases to identify genes and their
              functions, predict the metabolic biochemistry a cell can perform, and represent
              the physiological behavior of a given strain based on its metabolism, (2) to
              develop algorithms that will predict the impact of altering the genotype on
              growth, metabolic flux and pathway utilization, and predict changes in
              genome-wide patterns of gene expression as a function of changes in growth
              conditions, and (3) to develop experimental approaches using E. coli K-12 to
              directly test the predictions made by in silico analysis. The approaches will
              involve the use of DNA chip technology to monitor genome-wide changes in gene
              expression in wild type cells under well-defined environmental conditions and
              the rigorous construction of isogenic strains whose metabolic activities can be
              experimentally determined and compared to the predictions generated by the in
              silico analysis. 

This Award is part of the Interagency Activity in
              Metabolic Engineering (NSF 98-49).
