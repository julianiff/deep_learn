Abstract    :
              ESI-9814214  Jester    This planning grant, which is part of a joint National
              Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Education K-8 mathematics initiative,
              will focus on developing a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in
              grades 6-8 in 27 school districts in South Central Arkansas.  The primary
              purpose of the grant is to facilitate dialogue among mathematics educators and
              community stakeholders in order to: develop a shared vision for mathematics
              education reform; study and select exemplary instructional materials; engage in
              the strategic planning of professional development; and identify available
              local, state, and federal resources, such as Title I, that can be coordinated
              in support of this mathematics reform.
