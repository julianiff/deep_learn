Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research on biomimetic oxidation mechanisms by Dr. John T. Groves of
              the Chemistry Department, Princeton University.  Five types of reactions will
              be investigated:  oxidations by oxo- and peroxo-metal complexes; catalytic
              oxidation by ruthenium porphyrins; hydrocarbon oxygenation by nitrous oxide;
              catalysts for asymmetric oxygenation; and non-heme di-iron catalysts for
              oxidation of hydrocarbons.  The mechanisms of these reactions will be studied
              in detail using fast kinetic techniques, including rapid-mixing methods,
              paramagnetic NMR relaxation, and isotopic fractionation.

Catalytic
              oxygenation of hydrocarbons continues to be of fundamental interest and
              potentially of great economic value in the chemical process industry. 
              Understanding the underlying mechanisms is expected to lead to new approaches
              to important synthetic and industrial organic chemistry, and also to offer
              insights into significant biochemical transformations.  Development of  nitrous
              oxide as an oxidant would offer an industrially ecological alternative to
              oxygen since it would utilize a greenhouse gas generated as a byproduct of
              nylon production.
