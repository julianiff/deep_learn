The Great Lakes Science Center plans to enhance an existing
              facility by adding the Great Lakes Situation Room.  This addition makes
              innovative use of live theater techniques to provide interactive programming
              for the visiting audience.  The Great Lakes Science Center is a relatively new
              addition to the Informal Science arena but the visitation has double the
              expected projections. The programs for the situation room are:  Science and
              Information Technology Show; Great Lakes Data Quest; My Own House Data Quest;
              and Mathematics All Around Us.  These new programs, linked to the Great Lakes
              Environment and exhibitions throughout the facility will further enable the
              visitor to actually learn about science, environment, and technology using a
              unique format and "state of the arts" tools made available by informational
              technology.  

This project will impact a large, diverse audience in the
              Great Lake's area and beyond.  It has the potential for replication in other
              museums and science centers.  The goals of this project are to enhance the
              visitor's experiences and learning while at the science center.  The themes for
              the programs will explore some popular topics among the visiting audience. 
              This is a three-year project that will quintuple the programming capacity of
              the theater, enhance its role in providing Informal Science Education, provide
              new active learning experiences  and expand the center's capacity for
              accommodating larger audiences of families and school students.

The cost
              sharing for this award is 66.5% of the projected total budget.
