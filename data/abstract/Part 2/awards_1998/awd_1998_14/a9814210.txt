Abstract    :
              The Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) and the NSF
              Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center in Monterey are coordinating
              a series of activities designed to target articulation between MATE and the
              community of research universities and institutions involved in oceanographic
              science and technology.  These universities and other institutions represent a
              current and future employer for the graduates of marine technology programs. 
              The project is identifying opportunities, tools, and mechanisms for
              establishing and maintaining a long-term relationship among the oceanographic
              basic research community and the network of community colleges involved in the
              MATE program.    Marine technicians who are the primarily beneficiaries of
              two-year college marine technology education programs work in a wide variety of
              jobs and represent a major portion of the workforce at the oceanographic
              research universities and institutes in the united States.  Three primary areas
              involving marine technicians are being addressed in the projects: 
              demographics, curriculum development, and infrastructure and management of the
              workforce. The workshop organized by CORE will use a multifaceted approach to
              address issues in demographics, curriculum development, and infrastructure. 
              Activities include:  (a)  a survey of research community to establish baseline
              data on duties and responsibilities and education of marine technicians; (b)
              bringing together of a steering committee to define the structure and final
              questions to be addressed in such a workshop; (c) organizing and convening the
              workshop itself; and (d) development and widespread dissemination of products
              relating to workshop activities.
