     Partial melting in the core of orogens likely controls
              the rheology of the crust subsequent to crustal thickening.  Geophysical
              observations suggest that the deep crust under active orogens, such as southern
              Tibet, is decoupled from the lithospheric mantle and the rigid upper crust. 
              This deep crust probably has a low viscosity and is able to flow.  This project
              is aimed at providing an observational database to these conceptual geodynamic
              models by study of migmatites associated with the Shuswap metamorphic core
              complex in the Canadian Cordillera.  The work will determine the P-T time paths
              of the metamorphic rocks, locate partial melting on this path and determine
              pressure of emplacement.  Textural and petrologic analysis will constrain the
              conditions of partial melting and will determine flow of the partially mullen
              crust from shape preferred orientations of minerals.  Results will be useful in
              testing and refining models of orogenic collapse and extension.
