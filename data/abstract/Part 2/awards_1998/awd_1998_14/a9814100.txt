The inability of insect cells to generate glycoproteins
              similar in carbohydrate composition to those of mammalian cells has limited the
              wider application of insect cells as vehicles for the production of
              glycoproteins of mammalian origin.  While mammalian cells often produce
              glycoproteins containing complex oligosaccharides terminating in sialic acid,
              insect cells typically generate glycoforms containing short truncated
              oligosaccharides terminating in mannose or N-acetylglucosamine.  The
              composition of these covalently-attached carbohydrates, especially the presence
              of sialic acid, can significantly affect a glycoprotein's structure, stability,
              biologicaal activity, and in vivo circulatory half-life.  Consequently, the
              objective of this project is to manipulate carbohydrate processing pathways in
              insect cells in such a way that these cells will produce sialylated
              glycoproteins.  This inter-disciplinary and inter-agency project will involve
              participating scientists and engineers from Johns Hopkins University, the
              University of Wyoming, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National
              Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Forest Service of the Department of
              Agriculture (USDA).
