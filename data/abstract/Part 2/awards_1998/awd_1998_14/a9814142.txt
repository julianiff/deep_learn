Abstract    :
              9814142  Zborowski  A conference on "Scientific and Clinical Applications of 
              Magnetic Carriers" is being convened by the Cleveland Clinic  Foundation on May
              28-30, 1998.  The overall objective of the  meeting is to provide an
              opportunity for investigators  involved in the development and applications of
              magnetic  microcarriers to discuss the current and future directions  of the
              field.  The conference is the second of what is  expected to be a series of
              meetings that were initiated in  Rostock, Germany in 1995.  The National
              Science Foundation  is providing funding for partial support of conference 
              expenses for 15 U.S. academic researchers.    Magnetic microcarriers are
              finding important applications in  medicine such as nanoparticle contrast
              agents in diagnostic  MRI procedures, drug delivery, automation of clinical 
              chemistry, blood flow visualization, and magnetic fluid  hyperthermia.  Ways
              are being investigated to introduce such  materials into viruses that seek out
              particular types of  cells, with the potential these could be used as probes in
               non-invasive diagnostic techniques, particularly magnetic  resonance imaging. 
              Such microcarriers represent important  developments in nanotechnology, which
              is an area of research  with special interest to the Foundation.    The meeting
              addresses an important and emerging field of  research and application, is well
              organized, and contributes  to research program planning as well as the
              assessment of  new technologies.  ***
