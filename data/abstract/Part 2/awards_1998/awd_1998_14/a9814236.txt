Abstract    :
              Julian Talbot is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of two specific problems: 1)
              the adsorption of macromolecules such as proteins from solution; and 2) the
              compaction of granular materials.  The theoretical approach to these problems
              involves computational lattice simulation techniques and the theory of  random
              sequential adsorption.  

Granular compaction is important in the production,
              packing and transportation of foods, grains, chemicals and drugs.  Protein
              adsorption is a key step in many industrial and biomedical applications.  In
              spite of this the kinetics of absorption and compaction, particularly of
              mixtures, is poorly understood at the present time.  The proposed work will
              advance our fundamental understanding of the kinetics of these important
              systems.
