Abstract    :
              9814388  DeGrandpre    In  this  project,  the  principal  investigator  will 
              take  advantage  of  an  oceanographic cruise  of  opportunity  to  study  the
              relationship between the in-situ partial pressure  of  carbon  dioxide  in
              surface seawater  of  the  northeast  Pacific  Ocean and ocean color satellite
              data from the  NASA  SeaWiFS satellite.  The site, called Ocean Station Papa,
              has  been well studied over the past two decades, so there is  an  excellent
              historical database of carbon dioxide, chlorophyll-  a,  and other variables
              related to the oceanic carbon cycle.  The  site  is  known to undergo seasonal
              variations  in  sea  surface  temperature and primary production, both  of 
              which  are  observable by satellite color sensors.   The  principle 
              investigator will explore relationships between the  partial  pressure of
              carbon dioxide and these two variables and  also  with   episodic  inputs  of 
              atmospheric  dust,   which   is  observable  with satellite aerosol images.  
              If  successful,  the  project could be extended eventually to monitor and map 
              variations  in the CO2 physicochemical state of the  surface  ocean worldwide
