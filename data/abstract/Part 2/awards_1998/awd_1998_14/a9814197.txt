Abstract    :
              During the growth phase of a substorm the magnetic field in the Earth's
              magnetotail stretches out in the anti-sunward direction and becomes compressed
              in the N-S direction.  This produces a thin sheet of electric current near the
              center.  The proposed research will examine the physics of these thin current
              sheets and investigate the conditions under which the sheet may become
              unstable.  Instabilities in the current sheet are a likely cause of the
              explosive release of energy known as a magnetic sub-storm.  The proposed
              research will use a nonlocal linear stability analysis for a two-fluid plasma. 
              Several potential instabilities will be examined, including the Cross-field
              current Instability, the ballooning mode instability and various interchange
              instabilities.  After the nonlocal stability analysis has been completed the
              results will be generalized to a kinetic formalism that can be used to examine
              the collisionless tearing instability.
