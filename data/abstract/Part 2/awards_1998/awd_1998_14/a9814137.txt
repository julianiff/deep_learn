Abstract    :
              9814137
A series of two planning workshops are supported with the goals of
              establishing the state of the art in the
three scientific communitiesof
              Computer Security, Fault Tolerance, and Software Assurance ant to set the
              
course for future research.  The meetings, July 7-9, 1998 in York, UK and
              November 11-13 in  Williamsburg, VA, focus on the practical needs of system
              development, where security, fault tolerance, and assurance requirements are
              increasing dramatically with the rapid spread of commercial enterprises into
              cyberspace.  The workshops are designed to promote a true dialogue between the
              communities, as well as foster collaborations between researchers in the USA
              and abroad.  The motivating idea for the workshops is that these three
              communities face many closely related problems, and consequently solutions from
              one community are likely to be relevant in all communities.  Participants are
              asked to elaborate the fundamental challenges facing their community, map these
              challenges to related problems in the companion communities, and identify
              promising solution paths.  A book is planned to capture the results of the
              workshop, including papers and supplementary reports from the meetings.***
