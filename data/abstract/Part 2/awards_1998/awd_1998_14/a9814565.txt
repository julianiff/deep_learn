This research involves the determination of seismic
              heterogeneity and anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath North America using
              two complementary analyses of surface and body waves recorded at broadband
              stations across the continent.  Data will be retrieved from the Global Seismic
              Network (GSN), the U.S. National Seismic Network (USNSN), and numerous
              temporary deployments of the high-capability PASSCAL seismometers.  Two new
              analysis techniques will be applied to explore the nature of seismic anisotropy
              and its relationship to the tectonic behavior and evolution of the continent. 
              The first technique involves multi-station differential phase-delay analysis
              applied to fundamental and higher-mode surface waves, both Love and Rayleigh
              waves, propagating across the array at various azimuths.  The data will be
              inverted for a three-dimensional model of azimuthal anisotropy, with length
              scales spanning roughly a few 100 km to a few 1000 km.  The second technique
              involves measuring S-wave splitting time separations throughout the region. 
              Depth sensitivity is achieved through the use of a variety of body- and
              surface-wave phases.  Application of these techniques to shear wave propagation
              across North America will illuminate the basic geodynamic processes giving rise
              to seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle.
