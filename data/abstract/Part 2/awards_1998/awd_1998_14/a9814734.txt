The Office of Women's Programs (OWP) at Stevens Institute of
              Technology has offered a wide array of mathematics, science and engineering
              programs over the past 20 years at the precollege and college levels in support
              of women.  OWP has also served as a national model, developing and implementing
              several initiatives to provide other colleges and universities with resources,
              curricula, materials, and technical expertise to effectively mentor students
              and increase the representation of women in engineering in the U.S.  Over
              17,000 young women in grades seven through eleven have participated in OWP
              engineering and science career awareness programs.
