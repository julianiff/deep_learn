The P.I. and collaborators are proposing a Global
              Positioning System (GPS) survey to develop a detailed velocity field for the
              western Mediterranean region including the Betic-Rif and Atlas mountain
              systems.  Furthermore, in cooperation with their European colleagues, and in
              conjunction with their ongoing efforts in the eastern Mediterranean and the
              Middle East, they will develop comprehensive maps of present-day motions and
              strains extending from the Azores to the Caucasus using continuous and survey
              GPS stations throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Middle East. 
              These crustal deformation maps, together with auxiliary geologic and
              geophysical data, promise to provide fundamentally new information on earth
              dynamics in the Africa-Arabia-Eurasia plate collision zone with direct
              implications for earthquake hazard evaluation and mitigation.
