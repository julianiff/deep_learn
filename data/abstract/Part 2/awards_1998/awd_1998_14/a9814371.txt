Determining Transient Physical Conditions under the
              Southern Laurentide Ice
Sheet Using Geologic Information and Numerical
              Modeling by David M. Mickelson and Paul Cutler (Department of Geology and
              Geophysics, University of Wisconsin, Douglas R. MacAyeal (Department of
              Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago) and Patrick M. Colgan (Department
              of Geology, Northeastern University).  We will reconstruct the dynamics and
              subglacial environment of the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet (SLIS) during the
              late Wisconsin by integrating the glacial geologic record with numerical
              ice-sheet modeling.  We focus on the SLIS because there are striking contrasts
              in landform assemblages from north to south, and the record of ice sheets is
              well documented in time and space.  Data will be organized and analyzed in a
              geographic information system.  Our ice-sheet model is two-dimensional,
              time-dependent, and incorporates the upper 1-km of the subsurface in addition
              to overlying ice.  The model will
be adapted to handle basal/subsurface
              processes by adding a 'geologic package'.  This will include treatment of
              permafrost, hydrology, basal motion and till dynamics. This modeling will help
              us understand the conditions of formation of the glacial landscape of the Great
              Lakes area.
