Design Technology in After School Programs is a
              collaboration between science centers and community-based programs to provide
              "hands on" activities for children age 6-10 in an informal setting.  This
              project enables science centers and community-based organizations to use their
              expertise to conduct outreach for students and their parents using activities
              developed.  The activities will consist of a variety of design projects that
              will challenge children to build working models of technological devices.  The
              materials involved in the activities are common everyday items that are usually
              found around the home.  The project will be scaled up each of the three years
              to reach six science centers and 25-30 after school programs in major areas of
              the eastern part of the United States.  The PI will produce a manual for
              collaboration and a design technology guide for publication and national
              dissemination.

The cost sharing for this project is 33% of the total project
              budget.
