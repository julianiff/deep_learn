Abstract    :
              The investigators at this undergraduate institution will study the mechanisms
              that drive solar torsional oscillations.  The rotational perturbation exhibits
              a time-dependent pattern which links it to the Sun's magnetic activity cycle. 
              Comparisons of the torsional pattern with the cycle-related patterns of
              meridional flow and magnetic field suggest that it is actually made up of three
              separate phenomena, and that each is the result of Coriolis forces.  These
              three are: (1) a polar spin-up associated with poleward meridional flow to a
              downdraft at the poles at the time of polar field reversal; (2) a migrating
              zone of enhanced shear associated with meridional flows to a downdraft
              overlying the toroidal field band that gives rise to the active regions of the
              cycle; and (3) an equatorial slowing due to an updraft at the equator that
              feeds a poleward meridional flow.  The principal investigator and students will
              examine these and other scenarios that have been proposed through the analysis
              of data taken in two spectral lines at Mount Wilson since 1986 and with data
              taken in the GONG and SOHO programs.  This investigation will probe the
              torsional pattern's longitudinal and radial structure, and compare it with the
              structures in the patterns of meridional motion and magnetic field.  The
              investigators will also examine the methods used to reveal the pattern and
              address the possibility of making solar cycle predictions.
