This research involves the investigation of the nature of
              the rift-flank system of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, using data from a portable
              seismograph array deployment.  One target of the array is to record the seismic
              waves generated by earthquakes whose seismic waves propagate through the deep
              part of the Kilauea East Rift Zone in order to detect the possible presence of
              a postulated deep magma body underlying the zone.  If the deep magma body
              exists, the array should detect strongly increased attenuation (or possibly
              complete shadowing) of shear waves compared to paths that do not propagate
              through the deep part of the rift, and may record converted or reflected waves
              from the edge of the deep magma zone.  A second target of the array is to
              investigate the nature of the interface between Kilauea's volcanic pile and the
              underlying oceanic crust (the basal interface), and the relationship between
              that interface and the seismically active zones beneath the South Flank.  There
              is a continuing question as to the location of the fault surface of the 1975
              Kalapana, magnitude 7.2, earthquake on or near this interface.  The seismic
              array data will be used to (a) derive local models of Vp and Vs structure of
              the South Flank, (b) determine high-precision relative locations of South Flank
              earthquakes to resolve the geometry of the seismically active zones,
              particularly along the central portion of the rupture zone of the 1975
              earthquake, and (c) image the basal interface using Sp converted waves to
              assess the spatial relationship between the basal interface and the seismically
              active zones.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.
