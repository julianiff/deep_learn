Abstract    :
              This award provides support to the operation of the Subcommittee on Construction
              and Building (C&B) which operates under the National Science and Technology
              Council.  The operation of the C&B Subcommittee is managed through NIST.  This
              subcommittee is an effective organization in coordinating activities of federal
              agencies that are important for the construction and building regulatory
              agencies and industries.  The C&B Subcommittee has several on-going projects,
              including:a project to streamline the nation's building regulatory system,
              performed by the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards;
              the Partnership for Advanced Technology in Housing (PATH), lead by the
              Department of Housing and Urban Development; and the Partnership for Advancing
              the Infrastructure and its Renewal (PAIR) which is coordinated with the Civil
              Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) and the National Research Council's
              Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE.
