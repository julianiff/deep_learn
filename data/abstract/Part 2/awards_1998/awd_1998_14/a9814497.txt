The metamorphic core region of the Himalaya displays
              spectacular exposures of leucogranites produced by partial melting of the
              continental crust. These melts were produced over a wide range of pressure and
              temperature conditions as the orogen evolved through Late Oligocene to Middle
              Miocene time. This research will capitalize on the opportunity presented by the
              Himalaya to better understand the process of orogenic anatexis in time and
              space. Over a three-year period, an integrated field, petrologic, and
              geochemical study of multiple generations of leucogranites in the
              Everest-Makalu region of eastern Nepal will be conducted. This project is
              unique, compared to previous studies of leucogranite petrogenesis, in that it
              features high-resolution geochronology designed to explore the rate and
              episodicity of the melting process. Since the successful dating of
              leucogranites relies on U-Th-Pb analyses of accessory minerals (zircon,
              monazite, xenotime, and uraninite), one key to understanding leucogranites is
              understanding the behavior of accessory minerals during the anatectic process.
              This requires direct and continual feedback between experimental studies and
              field/analytical studies of geologic examples. The experimental component of
              this proposal builds on current research by Watson and associates at the
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by focusing on xenotime solubility in granitic
              melts.
