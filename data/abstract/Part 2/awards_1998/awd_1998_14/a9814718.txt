Abstract    :
              Jesse M. Nicholson
Howard University
HRD-9814718
During his 32-year tenure at
              Howard University, Dr. Nicholson has served as advisor to 14 doctoral students,
              9 master's degree students and countless undergraduates.  Under Dr. Nicholson's
              stewardship there has been a 100% increase in total enrollment in Howard's
              chemistry program and in the number of students pursuing doctoral degrees in
              chemistry. The program annually produces 20-25% of the nation's African
              American Ph.Ds. in chemistry.  Dr. Nicholson also collaborates in a precollege
              program that allows high school students to experience hands-on scientific
              research at Howard.
