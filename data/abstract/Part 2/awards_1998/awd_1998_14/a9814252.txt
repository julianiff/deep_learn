Abstract    :
              Professor Larry Sneddon, Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              to investigate polyborane compounds, which in general possess relevant
              properties useful in applications ranging from cancer agents to high
              temperature polymers, burn rate modifiers, and most recently as ceramic
              precursors. To exploit the properties of these polyboranes necessitates a
              rational, selective development of high yield reaction pathways. Hence, as a
              first step, Professor Sneddon will focus on novel, general methodologies to
              enable the development of systematic high-yield syntheses of polyboranes.
              Concomitantly, attention will also be directed at exploring metal coordination
              and other chemical and bioactivity properties of the unique clusters so
              produced. Next, the effort will be expanded into totally new directions, namely
              into formulating novel types of metal-catalyzed reactions for high-yield
              selective polyborane modifications, along with the synthesis and evaluation of
              new types of early metal metallapolyborane clusters, with a particular focus on
              those metallapolyborane systems that have the potential for antitumor and/or
              catalytic activity.
