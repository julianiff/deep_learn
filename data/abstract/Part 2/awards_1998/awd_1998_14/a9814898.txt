Abstract    :
              
This project will design instructional sequences and computer-based minitools
              that support students' development of sophisticated statistical reasoning. 
              This follow-up study of a previous 7th grade student experiment will enact an
              instructional sequence designed to support student development of conceptual
              understanding of co-variation and general ability to reason multiplcatively
              with data.  Also, the study will develop minitools which illustrate a vision of
              curricular design which integrates instructional sequences and technology. 
              Third, the study will investigate the role of technology intensive
              instructional sequences as resources to support the development of professional
              teaching communities.  And the project will investigate the sustainabilty of a
              professional teaching community within the context of the school.

The
              primary date sources for documenting the school contexts will be interviews and
              observations of teachers, administrators and parents.
