The mode of incorporation and consequent mobility of
              the trace and minor elements in coral skeletal aragonite are a concern to
              researchers who derive records of global and local change from chemical proxies
              in corals.  We are using synchrotron-based x-ray absorption spectroscopy to
              determine the structural site location at the atomic level (e.g., substitution
              for calcium, occupation of defects, discrete phase) of such elements as Sr, U,
              Ba, Mg, and Pb in the skeletal carbonate of a variety of corals and other
              calcareous taxa.  
Using transmission and analytic electron microscopy and
              electron probe microanalysis, we also will perform microstructural and
              microchemical characterization of the strontianite phase which we recently
              documented in coral aragonite.  Knowledge of structural incorporation is
              fundamental to the development and validation of new data sets being derived
              from Mg, U, Pb, Cd, and Ba.  The project results will be of interest to
              researchers studying sea surface temperatures, ocean circulation, marine
              pollution, biomineralization, and carbonate petrology.  Because of the
              importance of carbonate minerals in surficial non-marine environments, our
              results also will have bearing on problems in radionuclide and toxic metal
              migration.
