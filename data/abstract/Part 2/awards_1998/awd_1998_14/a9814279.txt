	The Film Arts Foundation is producing a science documentary
              film to present accurate renditions of the local part of the Universe in a form
              accessible to the public.  While work on our knowledge of the network structure
              of the universe has been rapidly growing over the past 20 years, there have
              been only rudimentary attempts to convey this information to the public because
              of the technical complexities that have made it a challenge to create an
              accurate display that is understandable by the lay person.  New technological
              advances have greatly allieviated that problem.  The high resolution animation
              in the series is being created by the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications.  This prime-time television series will be produced in
              high-definition television and will be broadcast as part of the NOVA series on
              PBS.  Ancillary material for use by viewers and schools is being developed by
              the Museum of Science in Boston.

	Additional project elements will include a
              set of half-hour programs called "What's Up in the Universe" for younger
              viewers.  This series begins with discoveries of the properties of the Earth,
              then steps outward progressively until by the sixth program the audience is
              introduced to the scale of the universe.  A paper and CD-ROM Atlas of the
              Nearby Universe provides easy access to important information and views of the
              universe and will allow users to choose from an index of rendered flights
              through space.
