Abstract    :
              This is a study of the residential and labor force positions of ethnic and
              racial groups in this country's two largest cities, New York and Chicago, in
              the period 1900-1920. This was the high point of European immigration into both
              cities, and it also included the first wave of large-scale migration of
              Southern blacks to the North. Discussions of this historical period, like those
              of the current time, attempt to assess the degree to which these groups
              experienced a process of assimilation into the mainstream or, alternatively,
              created or were confronted by enduring group boundaries. The principal
              questions involve the degree to which blacks and/or the main immigrant groups -
              Germans, Irish, Italians, Russians, and Poles - were segregated into specific
              neighborhoods and occupational niches, and the extent of their mobility over
              the life cycle and across generations.      To examine residential patterns,
              previously untapped data on the racial and ethnic composition of census tracts
              of both cities in 1920 will be used. Newly released census data files for
              individuals (the 1920 IPUMS files), which include people's address and census
              enumeration district, will be linked to these tract data, making possible the
              estimation of individual-level models of residential attainment.  To examine
              labor force patterns, the IPUMS files will be analyzed in terms of occupational
              clustering and segregation, levels of occupational standing, and the existence
              of ethnic economies based on concentrated group ownership and employment in
              certain sectors.  A unique feature of the study is the tracing of a random
              sample of 4000 of the 1920 residents of each city to 1900 census records. This
              will allow evaluation of assimilation and group boundaries to be based on
              analyses of occupational and residential mobility over time for a
              representative sample of the population including both men and women.    This
              study not only contributes to an improved understanding of the history of
              American cities, but it also will test specific  hypotheses about the origins
              of contemporary urban segregation and general theories about the social
              processes by which groups may come to be separated and experience different
              histories of mobility.
