Description: This award is for the support of a collaborative
              research project between Professor Michael Kifer, Computer Science Department
              at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. I. Hakki Toroslu,
              Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Middle East Technical University
              in Ankara, Turkey.  These scientists plan to work on the development of a
              powerful logic-based formalism for modeling of workflows and for verification
              of their correctness.  The formalism will be built on top of Concurrent
              Transaction Logic (CTR) for which there is already promising results.   They
              also plan to develop a prototype of a workflow management system scheduler and
              verifier based on this formalism.  There is already an implementation of a
              CTR-based workflow scheduler, which proves the feasibility of this approach. 
              The proposed implementation will build on this experience and will result in a
              flexible workflow management system centered on an extensible and verifiable
              task scheduler.

Scope:  This project will support collaboration between two
              scientists with complementary qualifications and institutional facilities.  The
              US scientist has been the developer of much of the theoretical background in
              this study, while the Turkish side has experience in the database management
              which is required to test the model.  The problem to be solved, namely
              improving workflow management systems is significant scientifically, but also
              has many important applications to the two countries.  The project fits well
              within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.
