Abstract    :
              9809738  Romanowicz    This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              upgrading the  Ethernet network for both the Geophysics Computer Lab (GCL) and 
              the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) at the University of  California at
              Berkeley.  A new 100 Base T (100 Mbits/s) network  with associated peripherals
              will replace the 10 Base T (10  Mbits/s) network currently in place.  The GCL
              and BSL provide the  primary data acquisition and analysis infrastructure for
              the  Berkeley Digital Seismographic Network (BDSN), the Bay Area  Regional
              Deformation (BARD) network and data archival for the  Northern California
              Seismic Network (NCSN) operated by the USGS.  In addition, the upgraded network
              will permit high bandwidth  connections to a number of Pentium desktop systems
              that were  recently awarded to the Geology Department as part of a larger UC- 
              Berkeley "Millennium" computer award from Intel.  An order of  magnitude
              increase in baud rate will improve the PI's abilities  to utilize parallel
              processing for 3-D seismic attenuation and  shallow crustal wave propagation
              models and will serve the  greater geophysics community by providing more rapid
              access to  publicly archived data from the BDSN, BARD and the NCSN.  ***
