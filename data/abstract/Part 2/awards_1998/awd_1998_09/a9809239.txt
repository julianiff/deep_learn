              Abstract  ATM-9809239  Barron, Eric J.  Pennsylvania State University  Title:
              High Resolution Simulation of Oxygen Isotope Stage Three  Climate    This award
              supports an investigation designed to provide a firm  physically-based
              foundation for explaining the climatic record of  Europe during Oxygen Isotope
              Stage 3 (between 60,000 and 25,000  years before present), and specifically to
              assess the nature of its  spatial an temporal variability.  This study will
              describe and  explain, using existing data and a series of climate model 
              simulations, the climatic and paleo-environmental conditions of  OIS-3 "warm"
              and "cold" climate excursions, and will examine the  sensitivity of European
              climate to variations in OIS-3 northern  hemisphere ice sheets, conditions in
              the North Atlantic, orbital  elements and atmospheric carbon dioxide.  This
              study will also  assess the ability of high-resolution, limited-area
              paleoclimate  models as a means of simulating past climates in cases for which 
              the quality and spatial-temporal resolution of the environmental  data exceeds
              much of the capabilities of coarse resolution General  Circulation Models
              (GCMs).
