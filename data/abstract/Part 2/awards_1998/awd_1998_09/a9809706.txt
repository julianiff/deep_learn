Since the publication of the Preliminary Reference Earth
              Model (PREM) in 1981, there has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and
              quality of seismic data as well as an appreciation and understanding of the
              effects of 3D structure.  Furthermore, there is now a sense that a model
              unifying several aspects of global geophysics and geochemistry is a possibility
              in the forseeable future.  Such thinking has led to several CSEDI-sponsored
              workshops on new Earth models, the latest being at La Jolla in May, 1997. 
              There is now general agreement that a reference Earth model should be broadly
              interpreted as a suite of models, data sets, and codes.  As a consequence, this
              grant broadens the scope of  the P.I's. collaborative work on reference Earth
              models.  The overall objective is to provide the community with a variety of
              internally compatible data sets and some of the codes needed to model them. 
              They expect that providing these "reference data sets" will result in more
              tightly constrained 3-dimensional models, and might naturally lead to a
              provisional 3-D reference Earth model.
