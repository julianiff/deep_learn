Abstract    :
              



This project focuses on the extent to which judges' introduction to voir
              dire can increase the level of self disclosure of potential jurors
              (venirepersons) during voir dire.  The research has two major components.  The 
              first is an analysis of  voir dire transcripts of actual felony trials to
              determine systematically whether judges and attorneys emphasize a juror
              standard of being fair and impartial and less so on being honest and
              forthcoming during voir dire. The second component is a laboratory experiment
              to test the consequences of such presentations on self-disclosure and honesty
              during an interview modeled on voir dire procedures.  In this portion of the
              research, the emphasis on the standard of juror fairness an impartiality is
              compared to an alternative emphasis on a  standard of open an honest
              self-disclosure of attitudes and experiences whether or not the may be
              disqualifying.  Participants in this research are to be jury eligible community
              residents. Previous research has shown that potential jurors may not disclose
              important information during voir dire.  The experimental research herein being
              conducted will begin to explain why.  Further, a method that theoretically will
              increase the self-disclosure and honesty is being tested
