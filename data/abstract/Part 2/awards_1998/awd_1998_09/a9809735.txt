Abstract    :
              9809735  Romanowicz    This grants provides two-years partial salary support for
              the  computer Systems Manager position shared by the Department of  Geology and
              Geophysics and the Seismological Laboratory at UC  Berkeley. This is a Phase II
              technician support grant under the  Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) program
              and follows three  years of Phase I support (EAR-9506660). The computer systems
               manager (Charles Paffenbarger) has been responsible for  maintaining a
              Unix-based network of workstations shared by the  Geophysical Computer
              Laboratory (GCL) and the Seismological  Laboratory. In 1998, two new faculty
              with strong computer needs  (Burgmann and Fung) are joining the department of
              Geology and  Geophysics and a new instructional facility, the Instructional 
              Computer Laboratory (ICL) is coming on-line, organized around a  cluster of
              Intel Pentium stations. Continued support of this  technical position will
              allow better integration of the high-end  computational facilities of the
              Department of Geology and  Geophysics and the Seismological Laboratory, as well
              as the  installation and operation of the new ICL.  ***
