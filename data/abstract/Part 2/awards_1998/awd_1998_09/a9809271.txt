Abstract    :
                    9809271  Urban    The Ocean Studies Board (OSB) will organize and host a  
              symposium in the fall of 1998 to celebrate the history of   basic ocean
              research at the NSF as part of the International   Year of the Ocean. In the
              year following the symposium, a   report will be published based on symposium
              papers   supplemented by other background materials and personal   histories
              that will document the progress of ocean sciences   over the past 50 years and
              NSF's role in achieving that   progress. The report will not include any
              recommendations   from the Board, although individual authors may express  
              personal opinions.
