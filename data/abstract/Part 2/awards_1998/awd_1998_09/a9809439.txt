The Department of Chemistry and the Materials Science
              Institute at the University of Oregon will conduct an integrated graduate
              education program with focus on the chemistry and physics of semiconductor
              materials and devices.  The goal of the program is to enhance and broaden the
              chemistry Ph.D. experience by offering broader coursework, industrial
              internships and teaching experiences in a multidisciplinary setting.  The
              so-called LANTERN (learn and intern) program includes: (a) an industrial
              internship program with the regional semiconductor industry, (b) associated
              graduate coursework on the chemistry and physics of semiconductor materials and
              devices, and (c) short courses on semiconductors and their devices, partially
              taught by the graduate students, for undergraduates and for non-technical staff
              employed by the industrial affiliates.

This effort seeks to broaden the
              traditional chemistry Ph.D. curriculum by incorporating lecture and laboratory
              courses in semiconductor materials and devices, a topical area typically under
              the purview of physicists and engineers.  The LANTERN program in chemistry is
              implemented in conjunction with an applied physics masters program; students in
              both programs will share courses and will co-participate in industrial
              internships, which will assist in nurturing a common language between both
              groups.
