Abstract    :
              9809983  Elmore         This award provides partial funding for the operation
              and  maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory, a 
              multi-user national facility supported by NSF to provide  accelerator-based
              mass spectrometry (AMS) capabilities in measuring  the cosmogenic nuclides
              10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I for the  U.S. research community. The technical
              goals of the facility are to  develop and calibrate methods for the analysis of
              very low  concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides found in natural  samples.
              The analytical data are used in tracer and  geochronological methods applied to
              studies of the geological  history of rocks, soils, ground water and
              extraterrestrial  materials.  ***
