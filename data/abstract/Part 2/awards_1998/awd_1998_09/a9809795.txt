              Abstract  ATM-9809795  Miller, Gifford H.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum Paleoclimates of the  Eastern Canadian Arctic
              Reconstructed from Biotic and Geochemical  Proxies in Lake Sediments    The
              Arctic includes many of the most sensitive feedbacks in the  climate system,
              especially those that may change substantially on  time scales of relevance to
              humans (duration of seasonal and  permanent sea ice and snow cover, position of
              treeline, permafrost  and associated gas hydrates, loci of oceanic deep water
              formation).   Sediments cores from Baffin Island lakes serve as records of 
              paleoenvironmental change; these sites provide the first continuous 
              terrestrial paleoenvironmental records through the Late Glacial  Maximum (LGM)
              from the Canadian Arctic or Greenland.  Recent  studies of Holocene lake
              sediments have also focussed on the  utility of this medium to evaluate
              lacustrine responses to Little  Ice Age (LIA) cooling, the best documented late
              Holocene climate  oscillation.  This award supports a study to evaluate
              regional  paleoenvironmental change during the LIA, and to place 20th-century 
              warming in a larger context.  This study will focus on "glacial  age"
              terrestrial conditions in the Eastern Canadian Arctic, and the  impacts of
              known dramatic reorganizations of the climate system  (e.g. Heinrich or D/O
              events) on terrestrial ecosystems in the  Arctic.
