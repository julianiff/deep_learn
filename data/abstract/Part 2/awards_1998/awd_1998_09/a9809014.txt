Abstract    :
                Whether or not  centralized wage-setting institutions enhance economic
              efficiency has been the subject of continuing controversy.  On one side are
              those who believe that centralized bargaining institutions enable wage-setters
              to incorporate various externalities in their decisions that would be ignored
              by actors with only local concerns.  On the other side are those who believe
              that centralized wage-setting suffers many of the same informational and
              incentive failures as central planning.  Recently, some have argued that
              centralized wage-setting worked well in the past but has become less efficient
              over time.  Previous attempts to study the impact of collective bargaining
              institutions on unemployment have been limited by the absence of reliable
              measures of institutional variables.  Through the efforts of several scholars,
              a new data set containing time-series data on the organization of unions,
              employers' associations and wage-setting practices for 16 advanced industrial
              societies over a 42 year period (1950-1992) has recently been completed.  The
              new data allows the testing of the importance of labor market institutions on
              the distribution of income and economic performance with much greater precision
              than previously.  Past work by the principal investigator has found a strong
              impact of wage-setting institutions, particularly of the centralization of wage
              -setting and the concentration of union membership, on pay inequality. 
              Centralized wage setting institutions and concentrated unions produce
              relatively flat wage distributions.  In the current investigation, the
              researcher examines the impact of the centralization of wage-setting and union
              concentration on unemployment.
