              Abstract  ATM-9809431  Hughes, Malcolm  University of Colorado  Title:
              Temperature Variability Since AD 1000 in the Western US from  Tree Rings   
              This award supports the development of long tree-ring based  temperature
              reconstructions for the Sierra Nevada, the Great Basin,  and the Canadian
              Rockies regions.  This will make it possible to  complete a western North
              American network of temperature records  for the last millennium.  In turn,
              this will permit the  reconstruction of spatiotemporal patterns of temperature
              (primarily  spring and summer) variation, and the placing of the fluctuations 
              of the last century into a longer perspective.  The project  constitutes a
              contribution to the global effort to reconstruct the  climate of the last two
              thousand years (IGBP/PAGES), and in  particular to the PEP-I (Pole-Equator-Pole
              through the Americas )  Transect.
