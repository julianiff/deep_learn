              Abstract  ATM-9809322  Arbogast, Alan F.  Michigan State University  Title: Late
              Quaternary Eolian Environments in the Interior of  Michigan    This award
              supports a study of post-glacial eolian landscapes in  the interior of
              Michigan.  A variety of large dune fields are  scattered throughout upper and
              lower Michigan, where they mantle  swampy lacustrine and outwash surfaces far
              from the modern Great  Lakes.  This study will reconstruct the geomorphic and 
              paleoenvironmental history of these dunes by documenting both the  timing of
              eolian-sand mobilization and the destabilizing variables.  In order to meet the
              research objectives, subsurface  investigations will be conducted over a broad
              geographical area.   Stratigraphic characteristics, including the relationships
              of  pedostratigraphic units and the morphology and orientation of  sedimentary
              structures, will be described in detail.  Geochronometric data will be derived
              through soil descriptions,  Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, and
              by estimating the  radiocarbon ages of organic-rich deposits (e.g, charcoal,
              peat)  buried by eolian sand.
