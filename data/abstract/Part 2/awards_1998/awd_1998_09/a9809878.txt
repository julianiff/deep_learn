Abstract    :
              IBN 98-09878 SHEA.  "Neurons" (the cells of the brain) transmit  electrical and
              chemical signals that allow us to think, feel and  move.  Neurons connect to
              each other by long extensions of their  bodies termed "axons".  These axons
              function essentially like  telephone wires, allowing neurons to transmit their
              signals to  each other.   Neurons are unlike other cells in the body in that 
              they are never replaced.  Once a neuron dies, its functions are  therefore lost
              forever.  Accordingly, excessive loss of neurons,  or disconnection of their
              axons, can lead to human disorders such  as Lou Gerhig's Disease, Alzheimer's
              Disease or mental  retardation.   Importantly, the axons are supported
              internally by  a scaffold comprised of many proteins.  These proteins 
              interconnect like building blocks, a form a skeleton (the  "cytoskeleton")
              within the axon itself.  This cytoskeleton  maintains the shape of the axon
              like girders can hold up a  building.  Unlike the static girders of a building,
              however, the  cytoskeleton of the axon must continually be repaired and 
              maintained with new building blocks. This process places a  considerable burden
              on neurons.  Our studies address how neurons  manage to maintain this scaffold
              for a person's lifetime, and will  identify particular aspects of this process
              that are prone to  errors that may lead to disconnection of neurons.
