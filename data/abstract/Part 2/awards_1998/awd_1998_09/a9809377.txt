Haimes
     There is a proliferation of existing techniques for
              solving multicriteria decision-making problems (MCDM).  The emphasis and style
              of these techniques depends largely on the field of expertise of its
              developer(s). This Workshop is aimed at bridging the gap between the camps. The
              workshop program, themes, and sessions are organized on the fundamental premise
              that MCDM has emerged as a philosophy that integrates common sense with
              empirical, quantitative, normative, descriptive and value-judgment-based
              analyses.   The workshop will consist of parallel sessions featuring invited
              and contributed sessions.  The final day will be reserved for a Workshop with
              panels on emerging MCDM topics in research, methodologies, theory, and
              applications.  The Workshop, will provide a forum (mechanism) to identify
              prospective collaboration between U.S. and non-U.S. scientists.
     The
              Workshop will serve as an excellent medium for the exchange of knowledge among
              U.S. and non-U.S. scientists and engineers interested in the planning, design,
              and operations of technology  (and non-technology) based systems where
              decisions are made under conditions of risk and uncertainty.    We expect a
              large number of participants from the Republics of the former Soviet Union and
              other third-world countries.
This broad participation of international
              scientists and engineers as well as selected international Ph.D. students will
              enable the establishment of international collaborations and networks.
