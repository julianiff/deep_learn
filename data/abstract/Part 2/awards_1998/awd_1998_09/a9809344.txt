Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Johnson will continue his studies of the structures and
              dynamics of nanosolvated anions including electrons.  He will use pulsed ion
              beam and laser sources to synthesize and characterize (X-)(M)n clusters
              (X=halide or an excess electron; M=solvent molecule; n=1-100).  Using two
              optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), he will obtain both vibrational and
              electronic spectra via photofragmentation action spectroscopy.  He also has
              ultrafast (100 fs) pump-probe capabilities based on time-resolved photoelectron
              spectroscopy.  Part of this work focuses on further development of the
              spectroscopic characterization using double resonance strategies or Raman
              spectroscopy.  

The goal of this research is to examine the structure and
              interactions involved when charged ionic species are "solvated," that is,
              surrounded by a shell of solvent molecules, most often water.  This type of
              information aids our understanding of the properties of these solvated clusters
              as well as of the different strengths of bonds within and between the ion and
              solvent molecules.  With this understanding it is possible, for example, to
              predict the spectra of solvated ions as well as the course of ion-molecule
              reactions, both of which are important for applications in ionospheric or
              plasma chemistry and physics.
