Abstract    :
              Using existing equipment for nighttime astronomy at Lick Observatory, the
              investigators hope to form a new approach to high resolution solar
              spectroscopy.  Their high resolution spectroscopic Sun observations are taken
              over much of the day, providing especially unique and valuable in solar fare
              studies, where typically only the spectrum around selected lines is observed. 
              In particular, the observational setup is valuable for observing and
              understanding 'white light' flare emission.  Previous tests with this concept
              resulted in a very detailed optical spectrum of a solar flare, and the
              investigators' dramatic improvements will lead to a permanent capability at
              Lick Observatory.
