Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a lasting collection of tools for converting speech
              to text and for speech understanding.  The collection is based on an extensible
              C++ speech recognition system, for which both source code and object modules
              are available.  Public access to this system is encouraged in three ways:  by a
              web site, with community-wide design reviews, and with educational materials. 
              The website includes the C++ software, together with a toolkit for evaluation
              of speech-recognition software and a set of Java applets for educational
              purposes.  The design reviews are similiar to workshops, and cover topics such
              as software design and algorithm selection for new versions of the publicly
              available speech system.  Finally, educational web sites and tutorials lower
              the barriers to performing research in speech-to-text systems.
