Caves offer accessible subterranean environments in which to
              study the
diversity of microbial life. These ecosystems are exposed to
              extreme
environmental stresses and may be based on inorganic energy sources
              rather than sunlight. An excellent example of subterranean microbial life is
              found in Lechuguilla Cave (New Mexico), the deepest cave in the
continental
              United States. Lechuguilla Cave, an immense, ancient cave
in near pristine
              condition, contains sulfur, iron, and manganese deposits and extremely low
              nutrient environments harboring diverse microbial life. The carbonate wallrock
              and overlying corroded limestone provide an excellent model for studying how
              life has survived, adapted, and altered this rock environment. Preliminary
              evidence suggests that the diverse community of microorganisms inhabiting
              corrosion residues includes fungi and bacteria that live by using manganese and
              iron. We will investigate the nature of the unusual microorganisms present, the
              means by which they adapt to their extreme environment, the energy sources that
              they use, and the overall level of biological activity of the communities. 
              Because of the potential for subsurface life on other planets and possible
              chemical similarity to Lechuguilla Cave, our research will also explore the
              relevance of cave communities to those that may exist elsewhere.
