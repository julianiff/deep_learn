Abstract    :
              This ESH award will support a coring cruise along the upper continental slope of
              Baja, California, targeting the oxygen minimum zone.  The goal is to assess
              variations in oxidation state during the Holocene, using presence of
              laminations and geochemical tracers (Mo, Cd) in order to assess (1) whether the
              variations identified in the Santa Barbara Basin represent regional conditions
              and (2) the timing of events, using radiocarbon dating.
