Abstract    :
              9809702  The PI's request funding to plan for the expansion and
              institutionalization of a marine science academy for high ability high school
              students within the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution. This is a
              partnership with Lincoln Park Academy, a public academic magnet school. During
              a well-received pilot program, the LPA students and teachers have come to HBOI
              for about 1.5 hours at the end of their normal school day.  This proposal
              requests funding to sustain, evaluate and enrich Year 2 of the pilot program
              and to hold a workshop to improve and expand the program, particularly for
              minorities and economically disadvantaged students.  Considerable cost-sharing
              from the school district, HBOI and corporate sponsors is provided.
