High altitude ecosystems are extremely harsh environments
              for life.  Unstable talus slopes and prolonged snow cover exclude plant
              establishment and soil development.  Almost nothing is known about the
              microbial life in these sites.

In this LExEn project, Steven Schmidt and
              Mark Williams will follow on from preliminary studies indicating that the
              microbial communities of talus slopes are composed of oligotrophic bacteria,
              but primary production is dominated by chemoautotrophs.  The PIs predict that
              reduced forms of iron and sulfur from rock weathering, and nitrogen from
              atmospheric deposition, to be the principal sources of energy for life in
              talus.  They will measure these factors, as well as organic and light energy
              inputs to the microbial communities.  They will also track the biogeochemical
              activity and population dynamics of functional groups, and test the
              ecophysiological limits of isolated organisms.  This integrative approach is
              facilitated at the chosen research site (upper reaches of Green Lakes Valley in
              the Colorado Front Range) by its proximity to nearby high altitude laboratories
              that allow frequent sample collecting and immediate sample processing.
