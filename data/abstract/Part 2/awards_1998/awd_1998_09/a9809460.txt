              Abstract  ATM-9809460  Schwartz, Mark  University of Wisconsin  Title:
              Connecting Spring Phenology with Lower Atmospheric Energy-Mass  Exchange    The
              objectives of the proposed  research are to gain further understanding of the
              progression and intra-annual variability of the first appearance of spring
              foliage--the green wave-within North  American biomes and selected other
              mid-latitude regions; and to develop a prototype technique (utilizing new high
              temporal resolution remote sensing data in concert with surface phenological
              data and models) to monitor annual and long-term variability of the
              mid-latitude green wave. The work is important because it will enhance
              theoretical understanding of the atmosphere and biosphere  by integrating data
              on a variety of spatial scales (global to local) thereby clarifying the
              relative importance of different physical processes for modeling at all scales.
