Abstract    :
              This ESH award will support a team of investigators to address three separate
              project, each combining the use of radiochemical dating techniques (14C, 230Th
              and 231Pa) with stable isotope and trace element analysis of corals and
              speleothems. Projects include:  (1) Calibration of the radiocarbon time scale
              between 10,000 and 48,000 years BP using previously-collected corals from Papua
              New Guinea and speleothems from the Bahamas; (2) Establish a high-resolution
              climated record for the mid-continent of North America from Missouri
              speliothems; (3) Determine the age and sea-level history for the Penultimate
              deglaciation (Termination II) using coral outcrops in Barbados.
