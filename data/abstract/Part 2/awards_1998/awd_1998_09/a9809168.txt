Abstract    :
              9809168  Kadko         One of the important unknowns in the summer surface 
              energy balance of the Arctic Ocean involves the fate of the  energy inputs
              (mostly shortwave radiation) in the  heterogeneous ice-ocean system during the
              melt season.  Downwelling solar radiation is the primary source for the  direct
              heating of the ocean through leads, but the fate of  the solar energy absorbed
              through the leads is not  adequately known. To understand the ice-albedo
              feedback, one  must know how the energy is partitioned between lateral  melting
              of floe edges, bottom melting of ice, or warming of  the water column.       In
              this work, the heat exchange between the leads and  underlying mixed layer will
              cosmic ray produced species  which is delivered to the earth's surface, and as
              such can  be used as a proxy for incoming solar radiation. Because it  has a
              known decay rate, it can be used to estimate the mean  exposure time of lead
              water to solar insolation, and the  delivery rate of solar energy to the ice
              bottom. The mean  life of the isotope is 77 days, and thus it is an ideal 
              tracer for evaluating seasonal processes.  Samples for this  analysis were
              collected as part of the initial SHEBA  (Surface Heat Budge of the Arctic
              Ocean) field program, and  measurement of Be-7 were successfully made. These
              are the  first measurements of this isotope ever made under the  Arctic ice.
