Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to study C-F bond activation in solution   using
              carbocation intermediates as electrophilic fluoride abstractors.    Systems
              wherein fluoride shifts between carbon atoms and  are reversible and  
              spectroscopically characterizable will be studied and ions containing   (C-F-C)
              bonds will be prepared.  The carbocation mediated activation of   C-F bonds in
              chlorofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons will also be   examined.  With this
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Thomas Lectka of the Department   of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins
              University.  Professor Lectka will focus   his work on developing methods for
              achieving selective C-F bond   activation.  The project has potential impact
              for the better production   of poly- and perfluorinated hydrocarbons, important
              commercial products.
