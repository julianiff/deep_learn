Abstract    :
              Argentina's incomplete industrialization between 1895 and 1940 has long puzzled
              scholars studying Latin America and comparative economic history.  By 1914,
              Argentina had the prerequisites for industrialization including the most dense
              railroad network in Latin America, a well-integrated consumer market, and a
              relatively active stock exchange.  At the turn of the century, entrepreneurial
              families expected Argentine industry to take-off and invested heavily in
              diverse enterprises.  Despite investments and attempts made by the Argentine
              government and entrepreneurs to stimulate the industrial sector,
              industrialization still failed to propel or sustain economic growth.  What were
              the obstacles to successful industrialization?  This research focuses on the
              business environment and firms' behaviors to explain Argentina's forestalled
              industrialization.  This project will evaluate the circumstances by which
              industry emerged along with the decision-making processes and rational choices
              made by Argentine entrepreneurs.  The objectives are: 1) to detail the
              structure of production in industry; 2) to assess how government policies
              affected entrepreneurial decisions; 3) to assess how accessibility to capital
              markets and the size of profits motivated entrepreneurial behavior; 4) to gauge
              the productivity and investment performance; 5) and finally, to employ the
              Argentine case as a model for explaining unsuccessful industrialization in
              poorer countries that also failed to achieve successful industrialization.
