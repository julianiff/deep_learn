This award supports the American Association for the
              Advancement of Science [AAAS] in advancing scientific infrastructures in the
              successor states to the USSR and European Communist regimes.  The activities
              will develop cooperative networks of and information exchange between U.S.
              scientists and researchers from this region;  assist these countries in
              developing new scientific structures based on competition, peer review, and
              democratic norms;  and will encourage the development of independent
              non-governmental scientific societies.  This award will fund: proposal writing
              workshops in Yerevan (June 1998) and Novosibirsk (September 1998); a program
              management workshop in Yerevan (May 1999); science writing and data exchange
              workshops in Prague and St. Petersburg; and AAAS Society Fellows for the AAAS
              and Rural Sociology Society. 

These activities fulfill the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity,
              and mutuality of benefit.
