Abstract    :
              9809928  Griffith  It has been known for decades that nitric oxide is a product
              of combustion and a major component of air pollution. Nonetheless, the effects
              of nitric oxide on biological systems received only modest attention. Interest
              in nitric oxide escalated in 1986 with the discovery that nitric oxide is
              produced endogenously in mammals including man; in the subsequent 12 years
              there has been an explosion of research and knowledge in this area. Because
              nitric oxide is a small, freely diffusible, free radical gas it is a most
              unusual biological mediator. Understanding the biochemistry and biology of
              nitric oxide requires not only the usual disciplines of enzymology, physiology
              and pharmacology, but also a sophisticated appreciation of nitric oxide
              chemistry. It is particularly important that scientists with these diverse
              interests and areas of expertise meet together periodically to share questions,
              insights, and experimental approaches.  The third biennial Gordon Research
              Conference on Nitric Oxide in Biochemistry and Biology, which is supported by
              this grant, meets this need. The conference will be held in February, 1999, in
              Ventura, California, and will bring together for a five-day meeting
              investigators from across the country and around the world. In traditional
              Gordon Conference style, participation will be limited to 125 scientists.
              Topics to be covered at the conference include the biological chemistry of
              nitric oxide, the enzymology of nitric oxide synthesis, the regulation of
              nitric oxide metabolism in intact cells, the molecular mechanisms of nitric
              oxide cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and nitric oxide production, signal
              transduction mechanisms involving nitric oxide, and metabolism of nitric oxide
              in bacteria and fungi. NSF funds will be used to facilitate the attendance of
              beginning investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students by
              reimbursing their travel and registration expenses.
