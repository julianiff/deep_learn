Abstract    :
              This project will examine the relation between clay-sized particles and the
              organic matter that is sorbed to them as they are transported through a river
              system (Eel River, California) and deposited on the continental shelf. 
              Preliminary work indicates that during episodic floods, particles discharged by
              this river carry a smaller load of terrigenous organics to the marine
              environment than during nonflood periods.  Analyses of the organic material
              (stable isotopes, C/N, molecular composition) and of clay particles
              (mineralogy, surface area) will be used to determine whether the amount of
              organic material associated with the clays is controlled by residence time of
              particles in the river, preferential erosion of deep soil horizons or rocks
              during periods of intense rainfall, or breakup of soil aggregates during
              turbulent transport.  The results of this investigation will improve
              understanding of the controls on the amount of terrigenous carbon buried on
              continental margins, which play a primary role in the global carbon budget.
