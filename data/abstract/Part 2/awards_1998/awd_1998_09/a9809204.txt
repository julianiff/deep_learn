Abstract    :
              Kasperson  Industrial Restructuring and Corporate Risk Management  Since 1980,
              U.S. manufacturing firms have cut more than two million workers.  More than 85
              percent of the Fortune 1000 firms downsized their white-collar work forces
              between 1987 and 1991.  The 1996 survey of the American Manufacturing
              Association reported that in the twelve months ending in June 1996, 49 percent
              of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs.  A decade ago, industry downsizers
              were chiefly failing companies who were responding to reductions in sales or
              shrinking business.  More recently, however, restructuring has involved
              successful firms engaged in a wide array of changes to realize broad corporate
              ends.  Corporations now seek to restructure the workplace, the workforce, and
              the production process to achieve the increased flexibility and efficiency
              required in a period of greater economic uncertainty, rapid technological
              change, and intense global competition.  But this restructuring has occurred
              just as corporations have been actively developing environmental and
              risk-management programs.  What have been the effects of restructuring on
              corporate environmental programs and capabilities?  Have such programs and
              capabilities been disproportionally affected vi-a-vis other corporate
              functions?  How have corporations adjusted to meet environmental and
              risk-management goals in a context of downsizing and outsourcing?  How
              successful have they been and are new corporate vulnerabilities in
              environmental and risk management surfacing?  This project analyzes these
              issues through an analysis of case studies have been conducted on corporations,
              am economic and statistical analysis of data from the Census Bureau's Center
              for Economic Studies, a survey of firms in the pulp and paper industry, and
              in-depth interviewing and document analysis at three selected firms.  An
              outstanding interdisciplinary team of researchers at Clark University's George
              Perkins Marsh Institute has been assembled to conduct the research, advised by
              a distinguished team of academic and industry representatives.
