Abstract    :
              University of California, Los Angeles   The proposed research will focus on
              urban poverty and joblessness experienced by segments of the African-American
              and Latino communities and addresses the debate about whether spatial or social
              factors are more important.  The specific objectives of this proposal are to
              analyze the merits of the spatial and social explanations of urban joblessness
              and poverty, particularly those of minority groups and to examine their
              relative importance.  Innovative survey data from a multi-city study of urban
              inequality in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles will be used to assess
              questions of job information, lack of private transportation, job skills and
              how these may affect employment.  Hiring behavior at the firm level will be
              carried out to determine whether suburban firms are more likely to discriminate
              than urban firms are.
