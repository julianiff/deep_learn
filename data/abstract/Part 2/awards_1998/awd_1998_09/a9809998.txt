Abstract    :
              The investigator is conducting comprehensive ionospheric E- and F-region
              electrodynamics studies at Arecibo Observatory.  Inspired by discovering an
              ionospheric phenomenon termed 'ion rain,' he is testing and extending
              hypotheses about the origin and scale of these 'new' electrodynamic processes
              resulting in ion rain, and related phenomena, including true sporadic E.  Using
              intensive incoherent scatter radar observations, numerical simulations and
              theoretical studies, he is hoping to better understand the origin and evolution
              of apparently small horizontal-scale structures observed as linked sporadic-E,
              ion rain, and spread-F events.  His observational approaches will confirm or
              deny the existence of hypothesized small horizontal-scale electric field
              structures, mapped along the largely equipotential geomagnetic field lines, and
              thus connecting the electrodynamics of the E- and F-regions to the magnetic
              conjugate point.  The studies are interactively continued with data obtained on
              actual three dimensional plasma distributions and drifts/E-fields.
