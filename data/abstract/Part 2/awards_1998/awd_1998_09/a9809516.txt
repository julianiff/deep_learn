Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9809516  G. F. Pinder, U. of Vermont    This is a collaborative
              project between research groups at the University of Vermont (Prof. G. F.
              Pinder) and the Autonomous University of Mexico (Prof. I. Herrera) in the area
              of multiphase flow simulation in porous media.  Transport of non-aqueous phase
              fluids will be simulated using finite element method and collocation method
              with a new interpolation approach based upon splines under tension.  The
              resulting set of algebraic equations will be solved using the conjugate
              gradient method based upon the optimal location of the collocation points.  The
              method will allow for simulations of flows with sharp fronts and use of
              parallel processing algorithms.  The collaborative project will include the
              professors and their students.  This project was awarded as part of the
              NSF-CONACyT initiative.    The collaboration will contribute to the development
              of long-term US-Mexico research collaboration in the area of computer
              simulation and environment (underground contaminant transport).
