Abstract    :
              Adams
This is a collaborative research project with Drs. Robert M. Kelly at
              North Carolina State University (Grant Number 9816492) and John A. Baross at
              the University of Washington (Grant Number 9816491). The overall objective of
              this project is to study the microbial populations released from within deep
              sea subsurface environments. This project has four components: 1) to
              characterize the biodiversity that exists in subseafloor environments and
              determine the nature of constituent microbial physiologies; 2) to determine the
              chemical bioenergetics of the subsurface, specifically the carbon, nitrogen,
              sulfur, and phosphorous species of microbial relevance that are prevalent in
              subsurface environments; 3) to determine the intracellular bioenergetics of
              model heterotrophic hyperthermophiles and those newly-isolated from the
              subsurface, including their primary energy currency and electron carriers, and
              their organic and inorganic "signatures"; and 4) to characterize known and
              newly-isolated hyperthermophiles from subsurface environments as to their
              extracellular bioenergetics.  This includes electron donors and acceptors,
              inorganic nutrients, and the capacity of the bacteria to produce exocellular
              polymers, to inhabit biofilms, and to exist as consortia. The results of this
              project should serve as a paradigm for the characterization of extraterrestrial
              ecosystems and potential life forms therein.
