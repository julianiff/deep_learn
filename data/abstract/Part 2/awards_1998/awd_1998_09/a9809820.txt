Abstract    :
                9809820  Heath  The instability of  fused cell lines such as hybridoma 
              remains a major complication in the production of  commercially important
              monoclonal antibodies.  In previous  work, these PIs demonstrated that the
              diminished  productivity of hybridoma cells is due to the formation of a 
              non-productive cell subpopulation rather than a weakening  across the line. 
              The non-productive cells were not  producing the essential antibody heavy chain
              (HC).  The loss  of HC production can be the result of DNA loss or mutation  or
              some kind of event affecting mRNA production, regulation,  or translation.  In
              this proposal the DNA-loss hypothesis  will be investigated.  ***
