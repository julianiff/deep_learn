Abstract    :
              9809273  Anderson    This ESH project will attempt to obtain precise and
              accurate  radiocarbon dates from Antarctic diatomaceous sediments.  Preliminary
              work suggests that modern radiocarbon  is  adsorbed onto the material during
              preparation, resulting in  artificially young ages.  A variety of directions
              will be  explored, including replacement of ambient CO2 in the gas  vacuum line
              by other gases, and separation of the organic  matrix from the enclosing
              silica.  Successful application  will permit the dating of known records of
              climate change  hitherto undateable.
