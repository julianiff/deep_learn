Abstract    :
                In an age of internationally mobile capital, how is government policy choice
              constrained by financial markets?  Despite significant research on the subject,
              this question has not been addressed satisfactorily.  Some political scientists
              claim that financial market pressures produce a convergence of national
              economic policies.  Others argue that national governments remain autonomous
              from financial market pressures.)  This Doctoral Dissertation Research project
              employs evidence from interviews with financial market participants, along with
              quantitative analyses and case studies, to describe the interaction between
              financial market operation and government policy choice in advanced industrial
              democracies.  The student first investigates the nature of the financial market
              constraints:  when making investment decisions, which aspects of government
              policy do investors consider?  How strongly do investors react to changes in
              these policy areas?  I then explore the implications of these financial market
              pressures for government policy choice.  The student concludes that governments
              of developed nations are strongly constrained by financial market pressures,
              albeit in only a few macro-policy areas.  Many policy outcomes in the 1980s and
              1990s are explained not by financial globalization, but by domestic political
              factors.  National Science Foundation support improves this dissertation by
              funding additional interviews with financial market participants.  These
              interviews gauge changes over time in the financial market participants.  These
              interviews gauge changes over time in the financial market constraint and
              expand the scope of the project to developing nations.
