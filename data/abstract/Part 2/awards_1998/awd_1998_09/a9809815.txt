Abstract    :
              9809815  Karniadakis    A new class of projection methods, the Discontinuous
              Galerkin Methods (DGM),  has been developed recently and has found its use very
              quickly in such diverse applications as aeroacoustics, semi-conductor device
              simulation, turbomachinery, turbulent flows, materials processing, MHD and
              plasma simulations, and image processing. While there has been a lot of
              interest from mathematicians, physicists and engineers in DGM, only scattered
              information is available and there has been no prior effort in organizing and
              publishing the existing volume of knowledge on this subject.    The authors of
              this proposal plan to organize the first international symposium on DGM with
              equal emphasis on the theory, numerical implementation, and applications. They
              plan to publish a book to serve as the first reference on this subject with
              both review articles and state-of-the-art contributions presented at the
              symposium. The Symposium will include both invited papers as well as other
              contributions in order to encourage wider participation especially from young
              scientists and under-represented minorities.
