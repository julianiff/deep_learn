              Abstract  CTS-9809784  Glauser & Ahmadi  Clarkson University      Presently
              Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurement cannot be experimentally obtained
              at sufficiently high sample rates due to bandwidth limitation with pulsed YAG
              lasers (15 Hz or less typically).  This poses a problem when dealing with high
              Reynolds number flows and, in particular, with time dependent and temporally
              evolving flows if more than just snapshots of the flow are required.  The
              objective of this research is to develop and fine tune a technique that is
              based on two-dimensional (2-D) Spatial Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE) which
              will provide a solution to the low sample rate problem.  The method combines
              the outstanding temporal bandwidth characteristics of hot-wires with the superb
              spatial resolution of the PIV.  The instantaneous velocities are measured via
              hot-wire anemometry at a few optimally selected points in space, simultaneous
              velocities are then estimated at the remaining spatial positions where the
              correlations, obtained from the PIV measurements, are known.  This new and
              important technique can be developed to its fullest potential at Clarkson
              University.  In addition, the PIV system will add a much needed capability to
              the Experimental Turbulence Laboratory and will impact several current and
              future major experimental research projects.
