Abstract    :
              This research will test key hypotheses and expand the scope of Cooperation
              Theory. This theory explains how cooperation and conflict emerge between two or
              more social units when there is no outside agent enforcing transaction rules.
              Although analyzed via game theory and computer simulations, few of the theory's
              propositions have been tested against data in natural settings. This research
              will use historical data from journals describing the first encounters of
              European explorers, traders, conquerors, and missionaries with indigenous
              peoples all over the world, during the 15th to 19th centuries. Some 20 Pacific
              Ocean voyages from a 280 volume historical collection will be content-analyzed
              for transaction sequences including such behaviors as trade, theft, aggression,
              and sanctioning. Many hypotheses can be tested with a before-after design when
              attributes and explanatory variables change in the course of an encounter or
              during the life of an expedition. By examining test cases for cooperation
              theory from natural historical settings, the generality of the theory will be
              enhanced, as will its applicability to issues of conflict and cooperation among
              contemporary groups in modern society.
