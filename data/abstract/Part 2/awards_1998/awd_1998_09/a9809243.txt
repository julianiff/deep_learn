The objective of this research is to develop a three-dimensional
              dynamic model of the knee joint to include the tibio-femoral joint and the
              patello-femoral joint, and to obtain experimental data to validate the model
              predictions.  The model will allow deformable contact and piecewise
              mathematical representation of the articular surfaces.  Model validation will
              be conducted by performing experiments that simulate dynamic activities of the
              lower limb, such as kicking, by applying impulsive loads to the quadriceps
              tendon of cadaveric specimens.  Once validated, and as a first application, the
              model will be utilized as a surgical simulator to determine the knee response
              under dynamic quadriceps loading following common reconstruction procedures for
              patello-femoral disorders.  This will increase the understanding of how the
              function of a joint or body segment can be affected by a surgical
              procedure.
