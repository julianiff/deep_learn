Abstract    :
              9809581  Bellamkonda  The goal of the proposed research is to design novel three
               dimensional substrate systems based on agarose to act as  bridges for the
              regeneration of neural tissue.  The approach  is based on previous work by the
              investigator.  The goals of  the research are to better understand the process
              of neurite  extension into the agarose gels, to investigate the behavior  of
              neurites at interfaces of gels, to develop novel delivery  systems designed to
              deliver effector molecules that would  influence the maturation and
              proliferation of cells, and  finally to evaluate the optimized agarose based
              three  dimensional systems in a severed sciatic nerve gap model.  ***
