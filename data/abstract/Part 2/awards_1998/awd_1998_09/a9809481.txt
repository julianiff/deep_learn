Abstract    :
              9809481  The PI's propose to provide affordable, up-to-date geoscience
              information and hands-on, interactive curriculum to middle school science
              teachers.  The project will involve faculty from the University of South
              Florida (USF), middle school science teachers, and an editorial staff
              consisting of USF marine science graduate students and a scientific writer, who
              will work together to write concise, provocative articles on cutting-edge
              geoscience issues such as El Nino, sea level rise, coral reefs, etc.  The
              articles will be published in six bimonthly editiions of Interactive Teacher, a
              magazine reaching 185,000 teachers nationwide.  Each article will reference a
              web site that offers middle school teachers an original curriculum guide
              designed by a team of teachers and scientists.
