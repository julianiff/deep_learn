Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   CTS-9809016  Hilary Lackritz/ACS    The American Chemical Society and
              the Optical Society of American (OSA) are cosponsoring a symposium entitled
              "Organic Thin Films for Photonic Applications" to be held at the National ASC
              meeting in Boston, Massachussetts, August 23-27, 1998.    The principal
              objective in organizing this symposium is to promulgate the science and
              engineering of nonlinear optical polymers (NLOP) which has emerged as an
              important and exciting area of research.  This symposium is designed to bring
              together engineers chemists and optical scientists to discuss polymer science
              and engineering capabilities and photonic device requirements so that their
              combined efforts will lead to new advances.  Schedule topics include NLO
              theory, optical characterization techniques, physics of glassy polymers, thin
              film waveguide fabrication and promising applications which will provide the
              researchers with a solid basis from which they may direct their research
              programs.  ***
