Abstract    :
              This award funds a workshop on Shape Computation.  This event continues
              discussions began at an   earlier event on the same set of topics sponsored by
              UCLA in  May of 1997.Shape computation is focused   on the study and
              application of shape grammars.  Shape grammers were developed originally to
              compute   with shapes directly in pen and pencil, paper drawings and physical
              models, with no requirement for   intermediate stmbolic structures or abstract
              representations.  The approach is novel in that shape    grammars possibly
              allow for any arrngement of spatial elements (points, curves, surfaces, and 
              solids) to be seen and interpreted in many ways within a fixed computational
              scheme - shapes can be   divided into parts at any time within a computation. 
              Shape grammars have been successful in furthering   the process of design in
              many topical areas.  This workshop will concentrate on theoretical refinements,
                computer implementation, applications in design sciences and applications in
              library and information   sciences.
