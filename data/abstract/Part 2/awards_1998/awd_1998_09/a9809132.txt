Abstract    :
              9809132  Trayanova  The objective of this research is the development of a novel
               model of the electrical activity of the fibrillating  myocardium with the
              objective of optimizing lead placement  for defibrillation.  The model is novel
              in the use of a  biodomain approach which incorporates both extra and intra- 
              cellular ionic currents as well as the active membrane  behavior.  The model
              also takes into account the orientation  and structure of the muscle fibers
              making up the myocardium,  something which the investigator has discovered has
              an  important bearing on the electrical activity induced by  defibrillating
              currents.  The fiber structure is to be taken  from a detailed map of
              myocardial fiber orientation derived  in New Zealand.  Model validation is to
              be carried out with  ongoing experimental work being done in the investigator's
               lab.  This research is in collaboration with a company,  Pacesetter, Inc., an
              industry leader in the design and  manufacture of cardiac rhythm management
              devices.  ***
