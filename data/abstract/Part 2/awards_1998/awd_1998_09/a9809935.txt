This award supports the PI, Juin Liou, and two graduate students
              from the University of Central Florida in a collaboration with Frank Schwierz
              of the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering at the Technical
              University of Ilmenau, Germany.  The research focus is on the modeling,
              simulation, fabrication, and reliability of a new and promising semiconductor
              device called the heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT).  The new transistor
              has a very high switching speed and superior current-handling abilities, and is
              ideal for use in high-frequency, high-speed, high-current applications such as
              frequency mixers and power amplifiers operating in the microwave range.  The
              U.S. group has extensive experience in the analytical modeling of HBTs under
              steady and transient operations, and the German group specializes in the
              development of simulators for predicting HBT behavior under varying
              circumstances.  The combined expertise will result in a significant advancement
              in knowledge of HBT behavior and improved HBT devices.
