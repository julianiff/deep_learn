Abstract    :
              Berg is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study  
              fundamental problems in liquid and glass dynamics using a combined  
              experimental/theoretical approach.  The broad viscosity range available   in
              supercooled liquids will be utilized for exploring the origin and   temporal
              development of dynamical features within the 50 femtosecond to   25 nanosecond
              window accessible to ultrafast laser methods.  Femtosecond   techniques and
              related theory will be employed for studies that include   probes of intertial
              and diffusive dynamics, the development of dynamic   inhomogeneity near the
              liquid-glass transition, and whether liquid   dynamics can be described in
              terms of `modes.`  An essential feature of   this project is the comparison of
              different dynamical measurements within   the same system.  The outcomes from
              this research are expected to   contribute understanding useful in developing a
              comprehensive molecular   theory of the collective dynamics of liquids and
              glasses.  Many technologically important processes are influenced by the
              dynamics   of simple liquids or other disordered materials. For example,
              materials   such as polymers, inorganic glasses, and biological materials are
              used or   processed in a fully or partially fluid state.  New insights into the
                nature of supercooled liquids and the liquid-glass transition that will  
              result from this project could impact materials design and processing  
              technologies.
