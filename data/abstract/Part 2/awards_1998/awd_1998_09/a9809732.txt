The focus of this project is on metathesis, the process whereby
              sounds 
appear to switch positions with one another.  Thus, in a string of
              
sounds where we would expect the linear ordering of two sounds to be
              
...xy..., we find instead ...yx....  While less common than processes 
such
              as assimilation or sound deletion, regular metathesis nonetheless 
occurs as a
              regular phonological process in synchronic systems  cross-
linguistically,
              thus countering the commonly-held view of metathesis as 
sporadic and
              irregular. Moreover, preliminary research suggests that by 
taking into
              account considerations of perceptual ease, a unified account 
of the
              motivation behind a wide range of metatheses is possible. 
However, basic
              knowledge is lacking concerning the full range of 
metatheses that are
              possible in synchronic systems, under what 
conditions metathesis applies,
              whether perceptual factors are able to 
account for all cases, and how
              metathesis interacts with other processes 
affecting sound structure.  This
              information is critical to the 
development of a predictive theory of
              metathesis. It is also of crucial 
importance for the advancement of
              phonological theory since without a 
clear understanding of the fundamental
              phonological processes possible 
in human language, developing an explanatory
              theory of sound systems 
is impossible. The goal of this project is thus
              two-fold: first, to compile 
a comprehensive database of attested metathesis
              cases; and second, to 
develop a predictive and constrained theory of
              metathesis.
