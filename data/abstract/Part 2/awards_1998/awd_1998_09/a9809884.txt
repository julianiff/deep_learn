Abstract    :
              Abstract  9809884  Walker  This research is aimed at understanding how
              environmental factors interact with the receptors in plants to influence plant
              growth and development.  Because plants must adapt to an ever-changing
              environment it is important to understand how information is transmitted
              between cells and how a response is evoked in the plant cell.  This process of
              perception, transmission and processing of biological information is known as
              signal transduction.  The research in this proposal is looking at the
              interaction of a plant plasma membrane receptor with protein kinase activity,
              which has been found to interact with a protein phosphatase.  The hypothesis to
              be tested here is that this phosphatase dephosphorylates the activated receptor
              and turns off the signaling response.   The regulation of signaling receptors
              is an important and active area of biological research, and these studies will
              provide important information in this area.  ***  The research in this grant is
              looking at the regulation of plant receptors which respond to environmental
              factors and affect plant growth and development.  These studies will provide a
              better understanding of the molecular basis of the response of plants to
              extracellular signals.
