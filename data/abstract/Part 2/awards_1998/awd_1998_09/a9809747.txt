Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project will focus on a historical study of
              scientific debate over mechanisms of evolution.  It will concentrate on Germany
              and Austria from the 1880's through the 1920's and take into account a wider
              range of Darwinian and non-Darwinian theories than has been analyzed in detail
              before.  Among the better known evolutionists to be considered are August
              Weismann, Ernst Haeckel, Theodor Eimer, Ludwig Plate, Richard Goldschmidt, and
              Paul Kammerer.  The project will build upon the solid foundation provided by
              recent literature on social Darwinism in Germany, discipline formation in the
              life sciences, and cultural aspects of German science, as well as a number of
              monographs on individual scientists.  The attempt will be made to bring out the
              diversity and contentiousness within the field of evolutionary biology and to
              show how experimental evidence was used to support opposing views.  A special
              effort will be made to sort out the varieties of Lamarckism and the sources of
              their appeal during this period of apparent `eclipse of Darwinism.` This
              project will also consider how advances in heredity, development and cytology
              around 1900 affected the evolutionary debates as Darwinians and non-Darwinians
              alike had to reconcile their postulated mechanisms with new findings
