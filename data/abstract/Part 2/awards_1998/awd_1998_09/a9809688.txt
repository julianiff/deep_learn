The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at Michigan State University focuses on sensing materials for control and
              diagnostics.  The Center also provides seed funding for new opportunities in
              sensor materials.  The Center supports education outreach efforts that include
              research experiences for undergraduates and outreach to the pre-college level
              through hands-on workshops for junior high school science teachers.  The MRSEC
              also supports shared experimental facilities that are accessible to center
              participants and to outside users, and broad industrial outreach
              efforts.

Research in this MRSEC is organized into two interdisciplinary
              research groups.  One group emphasizes optical probes of processes critical to
              engine diagnostics and sensing.  A second group explores various transduction
              methods for transforming chemical and physical information into electrical
              signals.  Participants in the Center currently include 21 senior investigators,
              3 postdoctoral associates, 11 graduate students, 8 undergraduates, and one
              administrative support personnel.  Professor Brage Golding directs the MRSEC.
