Abstract    :
                This is a project in linguistic semantics, the study of how meanings are
              interpreted from linguistic structures.  A central question of linguistic
              semantics is whether meanings may be interpreted directly from `surface
              structures`, the patterns of language as it is actually used, or whether a more
              abstract linguistic level must be posited in order to capture significant
              generalizations of semantic interpretation.  Evidence has been offered on both
              sides of this question.  The present project adopts the position that meanings
              can be interpreted directly from surface structures, and proceeds to
              investigate some of the clear problems that that position raises, with the aim
              of resolving those problems in theoretically satisfactory ways.  The
              investigator is attempting to construct a `variable-free semantics`, a semantic
              theory of language in which variables and assignment functions play no
              essential role.  Success in this effort would be a significant advance in
              linguistic theory.
