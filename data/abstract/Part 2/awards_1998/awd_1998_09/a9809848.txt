              Abstract  ATM-9809848  Davis, Margaret B.  University of Minnesota  Title:
              Holocene Climate Reconstruction in the Upper Midwest Using  Pollen Analogs   
              This award supports a project to use the modern analog method to  derive
              quantitative estimates of Holocene climate in the Upper  Great Lakes region
              from fossil pollen data.  An unusually dense  grid of fossil pollen diagrams,
              surface samples, and samples of  presettlement age exist in this region.  By
              stratifying these data  by lake size, substrate, and other variables, this
              study will be  able to determine the influence of these factors on climate 
              reconstructions.  Continuous climate trajectories will be  reconstructed at
              sites with good dating control to observe  millennial and short-term climate
              variation.  To define the  boundaries of climatic provinces recognized from
              patterns of change  in lake levels, maps of reconstructed temperature and
              precipitation  will be prepared for the entire area at 500-1000 year intervals 
              throughout the Holocene.
