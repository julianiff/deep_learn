Abstract    :
              9809438  Ravelo    This project has two separate goals, both using Pliocene 
              sediments collected from the California margin.  Objective 1  is to determine
              whether an interval of high calcite  accumulation in the mid-pliocene was a
              result of  high  plankton production, rather than an effect of dissolution.  If
              the former, this would imply stronger upwelling and wind  stress during the
              Plioene warm interval.  Objective 2 is to  look for evidence of century- to
              millenial-scale variability  in upwelling during the same time interval. 
              Accumulation  rates of calcite and organic carbon, and taxonomic  assemblage
              and stable isotope composition of planktic  foraminifera will be used in both
              studies to assess primary  production and sea surface temperature variations.
