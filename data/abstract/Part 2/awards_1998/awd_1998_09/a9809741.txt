Abstract    :
              Duncan James   This grant funds a project to explore the relationship between
              mutual fund managerial compensation on the one hand, and asset market price
              bubbles and instability on the other. As such, this research has potentially
              important implications for financial market oversight.  Earlier research by the
              PIs has shown that compensation schemes modeled on those occurring in the
              mutual fund industry lead to price bubbles, even in an environment where price
              bubbles have previously been found not to form. If this result carries over to
              the field, then it suggests that risky assets attract too much money (and safe
              assets too little); if so, then a potentially severe macroeconomic shock could
              result from this misallocation of investment capital.  The current project
              takes the next logical steps in investigating whether James and Isaac's results
              are likely to transfer to a field situation. To this end we conduct additional
              experiments; new treatments allow us to add further degrees of realism to our
              laboratory environment, so as to enhance comparability with field markets. 
              Examples include the introduction of  compensation contracts calibrated to
              various estimates of field contracts, and expansion of the scope of decisions
              so that unsuccessful traders may exit.  Results will inform discussion on the
              form of mutual fund managerial compensation.
