Abstract    :
              9809120  Blumenthal, Marjory  National Academy of Sciences    Special Project: 
              Computing and Communications Research to Enable Better Use of Information
              Technology in Government    This two-year award totaling $550,500 will support
              three workshops exploring the possible application of research and development
              to the arena of Federal information services.  Two communities who do not
              normally converse, academic researchers and Federal managers, will be asked to
              work together to identify the technical hurdles and possible research
              directions which might be applied in surmounting those hurdles.  Focus of the
              first two workshops will be on the domains of crisis management and Federal
              statistics, with the final workshop addressing the broad area of Federal
              information services in general.
