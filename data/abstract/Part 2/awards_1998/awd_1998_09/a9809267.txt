Abstract    :
              Within the context of policy analysis, this pilot project will assess the
              current state of statistical methods and computational algorithms for
              meta-analysis of time-to-event data, prescribe improvements for current
              practice, and carry-out preliminary development and implementation of these
              improvements.  The research will make advances in statistical science that are
              of broad interest and practical relevance to scientists and researchers
              involved in statistical modeling and inference in the policy areas of
              education, law, health, employment, housing, poverty, crime, and economics. 
              The assessment and development work will focus on the following: 1)
              Meta-analysis of time-to-event studies, including use of complete data and
              incorporating statistical output into a decision-theoretic framework; 2)
              Bayesian hierarchical modeling of time-to-event studies, introducing new
              theoretical and computational algorithms for the application of these models;
              and 3) Stochastic simulation and computer algorithms for implementation of
              simulation-based Bayesian time-to-event models.  In addition to developing
              innovative time-to-event models for meta-analysis of broad interest to the
              statistical sciences, the project will contribute to advances in
              cross-disciplinary applications through collaborations with disciplinary policy
              analysts and through initiation of students of statistics into such project
              areas, thus contributing to cross-disciplinary fertilization via research and
              education.
