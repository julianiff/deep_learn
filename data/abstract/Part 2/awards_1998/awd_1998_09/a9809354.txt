Abstract    :
              9809354  Berger    There is a dearth of accurate and precise numeric dating
              techniques  for Pleistocene terrestrial sediment older than 40-50 ka, the usual
               limit of radiocarbon dating.  Luminescence dating methods for  unheated
              sediment have the potential (based on kinetics studies) to  directly date
              detrital- feldspar burial time to well beyond 1 ma,  a time period embracing at
              least half the Pleistocene and therefore  many glacial-interglacial cycles. 
              This award supports high-  precision measurements on loess samples using the
              new, more  precise, infra-red- stimulated-luminescence (IRSL) dating 
              procedure.  Use of this method is expected to improve luminescence-  dating
              precision for loess by more than a factor of two, in the  established time
              range for IRSL dating (<400Ka).  Companion  termoluminescence (TL) measurements
              will be made on several samples  to validate previous TL results and to improve
              their precision  using more recent TL experimental protocols.  Furthermore,
              both TL  and IRSL measurements will be made on new loess samples to be 
              collected from sites in Alaska and the Yukon Territory (Canada).   These sites
              have newly documented independent numerical ages up to  2 Ma, based on
              paleomagnetic polarity-reversal boundaries and  fission track ages of volcanic
              ash beds.  Improved luminescence  dating of Pleistocene terrestrial feldspars
              should benefit global  efforts to extract time-series data from much of the
              Pleistocene  land record.
