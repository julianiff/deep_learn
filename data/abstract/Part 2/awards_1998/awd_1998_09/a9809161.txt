Abstract    :
              9809161  KOOYMAN  The habitat conditions and distribution patterns of emperor 
              penguin foraging in the Ross Sea during winter are unknown.  This must be one
              of the most extreme environments within  which any species of bird searches for
              food.  Working from  the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer a preliminary
              study  of these aspects of emperor penguin natural history will be  initiated. 
              Distribution patterns of emperors and other  vertebrate species will be
              determined along the cruise  track.  Single sample diet analysis of up to
              twenty foraging  birds will be conducted at various segments of the cruise. 
              The travel characteristics and diving patterns of four adult  birds will be
              determined using satellite telemetry.  The  results of these observations
              should provide an initial  picture of the preferred prey and foraging areas of
              birds  that inhabit the Ross Sea.  In addition, a spring census of  the
              colonies of the Ross Sea is proposed to assess if the  earlier perturbations of
              the past years El Nino  significantly affected the following years breeding
              success.
