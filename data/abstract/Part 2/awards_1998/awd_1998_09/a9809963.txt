              Abstract  ATM-9809963  Ratelle, Michael J.  Bates College  Title: Reconstructing
              Late Holocene Climate Change in the Central  Canadian High Arctic Using
              Laminated Sediments     This award supports a study of late Holocene climate
              change in the  central Canadian arctic archipelago using laminated lacustrine
              and  marine sediments.  In addition, through studies of modern  climatological,
              hydrological, and sedimentological processes in  several basins containing
              varves, researchers will attempt to  understand some of the complexities
              linking the varved sediment  record to the climate system, thus providing an
              accurate means for  interpreting the paleoclimate record in the sediments.  The
              major  focus of these studies is to evaluate the impacts and significance  of
              climate changes of the last millennia, particularly the impacts  and regional
              variability of the Medieval Warm period and Little Ice  Age.  Varved sediment
              records from the region will extend the  detailed information from instrumental
              records (post-1950) and  provide a spatial resolution to accompany
              paleoclimatic information  from other source.
