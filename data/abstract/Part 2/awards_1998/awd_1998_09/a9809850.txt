The project involves exploratory synthesis together with
              physical characterization of  metal-rich halides and, increasingly,
              chalcogenides of group 3 transition metals.  The studies will feature a unique
              group of highly reduced compounds in which metal cluster and condensed cluster
              phases are stabilized by strongly bound, interstitial elements in  nominal 
              metal octahedra.  The cluster hosts will include Scandium, Yttrium, and the
              lanthanides (R), halogens, the chalcogens, Sulfur, Selenium and Tellurium, with
              the interstitials usually being late transition metals.  These
              cluster-interstitial combinations are in a general way related to local
              interactions present for interstitials in pure metal systems.  Identification
              and characterization of new compounds, including phases known only by powder
              patterns, will be emphasized, especially for the new and novel metal-rich but
              electron-poor chalcogenides.  Physical properties of interesting phases will be
              defined by crystal structure, electronic conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,
              and photoelectron spectroscopic measurements, and these will be augmented by
              extended-Huckel (band) calculations.

Pursuing new and unexpected
              chemistry and materials properties in metal-metal bonded compounds together
              with an understanding the nature of their bonding and physical properties
              expands the boundaries of what is possible in solid state chemistry. 
              Ultimately such investigations will cover a wide range of new materials for
              which sufficient information and experience will allow broader systemization
              and reasonable predictions of new classes of functional materials.
