This grant to run the CESR facility and to perform high
              energy physics research with the CLEO detector will support studies of the b 
              quark, one of the six types of quark known to exist. The b quark is the
              heaviest quark which is stable under strong interactions.  Only the top quark
              is heavier. This fact allows many studies to be made of its properties.  An
              understanding of the quark couplings and of the couplings between different
              types of quark is basic to an understanding of the particles and forces of
              nature.  The ultimate goal of this experimental program is to understand how
              basic symmetries, e.g. CP, are violated in nature, which leads, for example, to
              the mechanism by which the Universe becomes composed largely of matter and not
              anti-matter.
