Abstract    :
              9809965  Chapman    The project is for a numerical modeling study of the shelf 
              break front.  The objectives are to identify and understand  the basic
              processes in both the formation of a shelf break  front and the frontal
              response to seasonal heating, wind  forcing and offshore forcing in the form of
              isolated eddies.  The goal is to understand the physics of the cross-frontal 
              circulation and the processes by which cross-frontal  exchange is achieved.
