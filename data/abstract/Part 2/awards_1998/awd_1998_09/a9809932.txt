Agrawal

This award will support Mr. Drew Maywar, a Ph.D. student
              under Professor Govind Agrawal, University of Rochester, to conduct
              dissertation research in collaboration with Professor Yoshiaki Nakano at the
              University of Tokyo in Japan.  Mr. Maywar will spend 12 months working in Japan
              on optical memory elements for use in photonic packet switching circuitry.  The
              student's dissertation research to date has focused on numerical modeling.  The
              proposed fabrication and experiment are intended to demonstrate a
              one-directional, 10-GHz optical buffer driven by submilliwatt holding beams.
              

The tremendous increase in the capacity and performance of communication
              networks resulting from the use of optical transmission lines is expected to be
              matched by a similar evolution of network-node technologies.  Work on this
              project will be towards that end.  The project enables collaboration between
              complementary laboratories in the United States and Japan and provides
              international research experience for an American graduate student.
