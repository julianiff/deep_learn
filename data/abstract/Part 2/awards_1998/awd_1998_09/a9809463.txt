              Abstract  ATM-9809463  Steig, Eric J.  University of Colorado  Title: The
              International Ice Core Data Cooperative    Ice-core drilling over the past few
              decades have yielded an  unprecedented volume of high-quality data from sites
              around the  globe.  Yet, data access and consistency of data quality in ice 
              cores remains a hindrance to the widespread application of these  important
              data to crucial questions in paleoenvironmental research.   The International
              Ice Core Data Cooperative (IICDC) was established  as the main contact point
              for the submission of ice core data to  the World Data Centers.  It has been
              successful in obtaining ice  core data sets and making them available to the
              community and has  helped to establish positive precedents for data management
              and  archival, including a particular effort to properly credit original 
              investigators for their work.  This award supports further  improvement in the
              availability of ice-core data to the scientific  community.  The project will
              place particular emphasis on  completing older deep ice core data sets and on
              obtaining a  comprehensive collection of shallow core, snow pit and 
              meteorological data, and on ensuring ease of use through  standardization of
              formats.  A major goal is to establish a  relational database that allows for
              comparison of ice core data on  common timescales.
