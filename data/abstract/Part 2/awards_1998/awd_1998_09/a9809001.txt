Abstract    :
              This ESH award will support participation in an international coring cruise on
              the Marion Dufresne to collect high-resolution cores from both sides of the
              Denmark Strait in the North Atlantic.  The cores will be anlayzed fro numerous
              sedimentological parameters (including stable isotopes and assemblages of
              planktic and benthic foraminifera and rock magnetics) to reconstruct the local
              variability of sea ice and land/ocean interactions during the Holocene and the
              late Pleistocene at decadal to centennial time scales.
