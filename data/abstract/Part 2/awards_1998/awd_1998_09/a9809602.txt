The goal of this project is integration of thermal and
              kinetic models with seismological data for subduction zones that exhibit
              seismological evidence for sluggish transformation of basalt and gabbro to
              eclogite.  The PIs begin by producing a kinematic thermal model that yields
              transient and steady-state thermal structures and the pressure-temperature-time
              evolution of the subducting slab and overlying mantle wedge.  Next, equilibrium
              and kinetic phase transformation models are used to predict mineral
              assemblages, densities, and seismic wave speeds.  The calculated velocity
              structure is then evaluated by its ability to predict observed seismic
              properties of waveform dispersion and converted phase amplitudes.  Misfit
              between the petrologically predicted and the seismologically observed velocity
              structure is then minimized by iterative repetition.  If the assumption is made
              that high fluid pressures are required for intermediate depth earthquakes, then
              the loci of dehydration reactions and the resultant volatile flux can also be
              used to predict hypocenter locations and compared to observed earthquake
              hypocenters.  The resulting integrated model of the thermal, petrological, and
              seismological properties of subducting slabs will yield further insight into
              other plate boundary processes such as intermediate-depth earthquakes, arc
              magmatism, and the recycling of volatiles.
