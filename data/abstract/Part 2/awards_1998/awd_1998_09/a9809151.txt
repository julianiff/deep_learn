Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
              Division, Prof. Delroy Baugh of the University of California at Los Angeles
              will conduct experiments on state-to-state studies of fast photo-initiated
              unimolecular reactions.  The goal of these studies is to determine structural
              and dynamical information regarding the molecular fragmentation process with an
              emphasis on separating the role of nuclear dynamics from that of the electronic
              orbital effects.  By selecting the states of the parent and resolving the state
              of the products, Baugh can obtain an unprecedented degree of detail that allows
              stringent testing of electronic structure computations and quantal scattering
              methodology.

This research is directed at determining the potential energy
              surfaces that control elementary chemical reactions.  Molecules are initially
              prepared in well-defined quantum states, which allows detailed tracking of the
              reaction process.  The results of this work will play a significant role in
              validating existing theories of chemical reactions on the molecular level. 
              Insights into atmospheric or combustion chemistry may be expected to result
              from these studies.
