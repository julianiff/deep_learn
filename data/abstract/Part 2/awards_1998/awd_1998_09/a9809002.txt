Research over the past two decades has shown that signed
              languages conform to the same grammatical constraints and exhibit the same
              linguistic principles found in spoken languages. However, unlike spoken
              languages, signed languages depend upon high level visual-spatial processes for
              interpretation. This project investigates the use of physical space to encode
              linguistic distinctions within American Sign Language (ASL) and builds upon
              this lab's previous studies of on-line processing in deaf ASL signers.
              Specifically, the proposed experiments examine the spatialized encoding of a)
              co-reference and pragmatic contrasts within a discourse and of b) locational
              contrasts and spatial perspective.

The research will advance our
              understanding of human language by illuminating the ways in which the sensory
              modality of a language affects its structure and processing. In addition, the
              results have clear implications for how ASL is used within an educational
              setting for the deaf by indicating how signing space can be manipulated to
              foster the comprehension of complex information. Finally, this project will
              promote the participation of Deaf people in research, providing an environment
              and training that facilitate entrance into scientific fields.
