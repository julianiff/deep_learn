Abstract    :
              The MOSIS service, through this award, provides low-cost custom and semi-custom
              VLSI prototyping and small-volume production quantities to educational
              institutions.  Cost savings are achieved by sharing the fabrication expenses
              between the different designs submitted by users.  Since the designs are merged
              into a single phototooling mask set,which is then used to produce a
              multi-project fabrication cost.  The details of fabrication and mask generation
              are transparent to users, who are therefore fre to concentrate on design rather
              than on the details of interfacing to an IC fabricator.
