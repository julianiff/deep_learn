Abstract    :
              9809585  Schiffries         A study will be conducted to identify high priority
              research  opportunities in the earth sciences as they relate to the 
              responsibilities of the National Science Foundation's Division of  Earth
              Sciences.  It will consider the role of NSF in the context of  related
              activities being conducted or sponsored by other government  agencies,
              industry, and international partners.  Linkages between  research and societal
              needs will also be explored.  Significant  efforts will be made to gather input
              from members of the broad  earth sciences community.  The project will involve
              workshops or  other information gathering sessions that may be held in 
              conjunction with scientific society meetings.  It will also relay  on published
              literature, technical reports, personal expertise and  other sources of
              information.  ***
