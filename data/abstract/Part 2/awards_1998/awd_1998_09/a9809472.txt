Title:
              Lacustrine Records of Late Quaternary Water Balance Fluctuations in the
              Venezuelan Andes: Assessing the Interplay of Insolation and Ocean Circulation
              as Paleoclimate Controls in the Tropics

This award supports a project
              designed to produce new multi-proxy high resolution paleoclimate records from
              the Venezuelan Andes and to test hypotheses concerning the causes of shifts in
              the precipitation-evaporation (P-E) balance from 18 ka B.P. to the present. 
              Previous work provides only a broad paleoclimatic picture for this period:
              prolonged and intense aridity from the Last Glacial Maximum to the
              glacial-interglacial transition, and a complicated history of water balance
              shifts throughout the Holocene.  The proposed research has three key
              goals:

(i)  The produce well-dated records of several climatically-sensitive
              proxies at century-scale resolution, in order to identify regional patterns of
              P-E balance from 18ka to present;
(ii)  To identify higher frequency
              hydrological fluctuations over the past 2000 years, using more detailed
              analyses of the same proxies at higher resolutions (multidecadal or better) and
              ;
(iii)  To compare these results with findings from ongoing research on
              montane lake records in the Southern Hemisphere (Bolivian Andes).
	
This work
              will reconstruct the climate history of the region by applying an integrated
              methodology that combines seismic survey, sedimentology and sediment magnetic
              characteristics, elemental and isotopic geochemistry, diatoms, and pollen.
