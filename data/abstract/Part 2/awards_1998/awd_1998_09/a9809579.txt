Abstract    :
              9809579  Computer technology is taking an increasingly important role in
              geoscience education, however in depth studies of how students can best learn
              from a virtual environment are lacking.  With prior NSF funding, Prothero has
              created a "virtual environment" for an undergraduate geoscience course for
              UCSB's large oceanography class of 200 to 300 students per quarter.  The PI's -
              a cognitive psychologist (Mayer), a science education researcher (Kelly), and a
              geophysicist (Prothero) - will collaborate to determine the effectiveness of
              learning in this "virtual environment". Some of the questions to be
              investigated include 1) how can educational technologies be used to create a
              virtual environment that promotes students' understanding of science?, 2) what
              are the necessary characteristics of a virtual environment that make it an
              effective learning tool?, 3) how can educational technologies support students'
              learning of scientific practices, such as posing researchable questions,
              arguing from evidence, weighing alternative explanations?  The results of this
              research will be used to create a teacher's manual oriented toward middle
              school and college level teachers of earth science. The manual will be made
              available on the Web and in other forms as necessary.
