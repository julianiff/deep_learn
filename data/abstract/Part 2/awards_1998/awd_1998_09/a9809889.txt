Abstract    :
                Description: This award is for support of a collaborative research project
              between Dr. S.K. Kawatra, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering
              at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, and Dr. Adel A. Nofal,
              Chairman of the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute in
              Cairo, Egypt.  The purpose of the research is to address pollution from coal
              combustors by identifying means for direct utilization of the high-carbon
              fly-ashes that are produced by Low-NOx coal combustors.   Specifically this is
              to address the use of these ashes, which have a higher carbon content than 6%
              by weight. The objectives of this study are to better understand the behavior
              of fly-ash in binder applications, and to use this information to determine
              methods for controlling the kinetics of the binding reaction, and to optimize
              the fly-ash binder characteristics for particular applications.          Scope:
               This project will support collaboration between two teams with complementary
              capabilities and institutional facilities.  The US team is currently studying
              the use of high-carbon fly-ashes as binders for organic particulates, such as
              foundry sands.  The Egyptian team will provide needed capabilities in the study
              of the interactions of molten metals with fly-ash.  The project fits well
              within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.
