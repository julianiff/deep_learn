Abstract    :
              This project involves four studies of macroeconomic dynamics all set in contexts
              where decisions are made under model uncertainty.  The first  involves
              extending the authors previous work on robust decision and equilibrium theory. 
              Here, model uncertainty induces decision makers to incorporate a preference for
              robustness of decisions across models.  The aim is to extend characterizations
              of the effects of Knightian uncertainty on prices of risky securities.  The
              second study analyzes adaptive learning as a source of recurrent dynamics.  The
              author develops and applies a theory of the recurrent dynamics that a class of
              adaptive models displays away from rational expectations equilibria.  The third
              study involves the discovery of key technical principles governing the proper
              supply of monies of different denominations as an historical case study of
              social learning.  The final study employs the use of an econometric model of
              hidden periodicity as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing theoretical
              models of heterogeneity of beliefs (i.e., rational beliefs versus merging of
              beliefs).  The first two studies and the last one are united in various ways,
              including the use of common econometric and mathematical methods used to
              characterize and manipulate the distance between models.
