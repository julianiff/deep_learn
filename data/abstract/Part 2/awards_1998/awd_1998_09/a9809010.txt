Abstract    :
                          9809010  Shiller      This study of management of income and
              inflation risks consists of three parts:  I. Institutions for Intergenerational
              and International Risk Management. Overlapping generations models aree used to
              study the role of government in intergenerational and international risk
              management. Partial government intervention in risk management, such as social
              security trust fund investments, may be justified because individuals cannot
              insure risks after they have been realized. Optimal social security systems
              from a risk-management perspective are derived, as well as optimal government
              investment in risky assets. Some data analysis of national incomes and
              speculative prices are undertaken to give some perspectives of the parameters
              of such models, analysis directed at measuring short-run as well as long-run
              uncertainty and at discovering the long-run correlations of existing assets'
              returns with national income innovations.  II. Indexed Units of Account. The
              experience of countries that have adopted indexed units of account, such as
              Chile with its unidad de fomento, is studied. The indexed units of account are
              considered from a theoretical perspective, for possible application of the
              units in other countries. The optimal choice of index number formula is
              considered. The dynamic effects in macroeconomic equilibrium of expressing
              prices in terms of the units are considered for the case where some but not all
              prices are rigid.  III. Miscellaneous Related Topics. A. Psychological
              literature is applied to issues on public risk management and saving. B.
              Econometric work on forecastability of financial market returns is extended and
              C. Improved indices of factors in individual labor incomes are developed.
