Abstract    :
              The State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) and the National
              Association of System Heads (NASH) propose to co-sponsor a one-day meeting of
              state and system leaders to examine current reform efforts to prepare high
              quality teachers.  The discussions will focus on changes in undergraduate
              education programs at public colleges and universities, and include profiles of
              programs supported through grants from the National Science Foundation's
              Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP).  The goals of the
              meeting are to (a) examine state-and system-level initiatives to improve the
              preparation of pre-service teachers for K-12 classrooms (with a particular
              focus on mathematics and science program); (b) identify continuing challenges
              to these efforts; (c) profile innovative and effective practices; and (d)
              recommend follow-up action.    To inform meeting participants and encourage
              group discussions on current and emerging policies and practice, two white
              papers will be published jointly by SHEEO and NASH:      A background paper
              outlining current state initiatives on teacher education and professional
              development.  The paper will include information on the roles and
              responsibilities of diverse state agencies, outcomes of recent state-level
              studies on teacher education, and supply and demand studies.      A report that
              analyzes new and emerging state teacher certification and licensure
              requirements aimed at strengthening the knowledge and abilities of new and
              veteran teachers.    The meeting will precede the annual joint meeting of NASH
              and the Association of Governing Boards (AGB) in Nashville, TN, April 18-19,
              1998.  Approximately 40 participants will be drawn from the SHEEO and NASH
              membership, and invited presenters and speakers.
