This project proposses to offer two National Association
              of Geoscience Teacher workshops on the Preparation of Geoscience Graduate
              Students for Teaching in conjunction with meetings of the Geological Society of
              America and the American Geophysical Union.  The workshops will bring together
              faculty from departments or programs representing an intentionally varied set
              of established and successful teaching preparation programs with others who
              want to implement or improve their teaching preparation programs.  The emphasis
              will be on demonstrating best practices for preparing graduate students to
              teach in inquiry-based instructional settings.  Dissemination will include an
              interactive web-site and publication of a short synopsis of the workshop to a
              longer summary article describing successful models for TA and future
              preparation in the geosciences.
