The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center
              (MRSEC) at Harvard University supports a broad research program organized
              through three interdisciplinary research groups, as well as a wide range of
              educational activities, including project TEACH (The Educational Activities of
              Cambridge-Harvard) which aims to interest seventh grade students in preparing
              for college.  The MRSEC is supporting the introduction of  "peer instruction"
              in area public schools and supports a nationally advertised Research Experience
              for Undergraduates (REU) program.  The Center supports well maintained shared
              experimental facilities which are accessible to outside users and also supports
              interactive efforts with industry and other sectors.  

One of the three
              interdisciplinary research groups is investigating artificially structured
              materials and electronic microsystems.  This group supports work on atomic
              surface transport, nanowires, soft lithography, and atom lithography.  The goal
              of some of this work is the fabrication of small structures without the use of
              visible light projection and patterning.  A second group is exploring the
              interfaces between synthetic and biological systems with opportunities in
              sensors, biocompatible devices, and tools for molecular and cell biology
              research.  The third group investigates thermo-mechanical properties at small
              length scales of diverse systems such as carbon nanotubes, multi-layer
              metal-semiconductor assemblies, and novel microsystems made with soft
              lithography.  

Participants in the Center currently include 22 senior
              investigators, 8 postdoctoral associates, 21 graduate students, 14
              undergraduates, and 10 technicians and other support personnel.   Professor
              Robert M. Westervelt directs the MRSEC.
