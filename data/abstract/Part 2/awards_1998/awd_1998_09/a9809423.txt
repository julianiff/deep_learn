The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
              the University of Alabama carries out a vigorous program on materials with
              potential applications in ultra-high density data storage.  Two
              interdisciplinary groups investigate thin films and particulate materials,
              respectively.  Of particular interest in thin films are fundamental studies of
              magnetotransport, nanoscale surface studies, the investigation of high speed
              magnetic switching phenomena, as well as nanoscale tribological studies.  In
              the area of particulate materials the focus is on potential applications in
              flexible (tape and floppy disk) storage media.  Investigations include the
              synthesis of small, orientable magnetic nanoparticles, and the characterization
              and simulation of the microstructure of magnetic particle dispersions.  The
              Center has an educational outreach program to high school science teachers and
              has very strong links with the information storage industry.  

Participants
              in the Center currently include 10 senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral
              associates, 8 graduate students, and 1 support person.   Professor William D.
              Doyle directs the MRSEC.
