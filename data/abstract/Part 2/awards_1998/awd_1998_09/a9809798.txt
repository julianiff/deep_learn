Abstract    :
              The study examines the paleoecology, paleoclimate, and geomorphology of the
              highlands in the Dominican Republic, and it responds to suggestions that this
              area was once glaciated.  Resolution of the controversy surrounding this
              assertion will provide insight into paleoclimatic circulation in the tropical
              Atlantic region as well as empirical evidence for calibration of global change
              scenarios.  Extensive field and laboratory techniques will lead to the testing
              of several hypotheses about the Pleistocene glaciation in the tropical eastern
              Caribbean. A range of techniques will be employed including coring, trenching,
              sampling of diamicton lobes, pollen analysis, and quantitative analysis of
              quartz grain microtextures and diamicton micromorphology.  The researchers have
              conducted pilot studies in the region previously and the proposed work is a
              logical and necessary continuation of that earlier research. The investigators
              hope to find evidence of late-glacial paleoecology and climate and to compare
              island chronology with the neotropical mainland.  The results will be important
              to paleoecology (vegetation dynamics in particular) and to paleoclimate
              dynamics.
