This award is a Cooperative Agreement between Cornell
              University and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to operate the National
              Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) for a period of 60 months.  The award is
              based on the response to a Request for Proposals (NSF-97-154) issued by NSF in
              September 1997, and on the subsequent review of proposals submitted in response
              to this request.

The primary research tool of the NAIC is the upgraded 305-m
              radio/radar telescope located near Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the largest and most
              powerful single radio telescope in the world.  The Arecibo Telescope and
              associated instrumentation have been extremely productive in the areas of
              atmospheric and ionospheric studies, solar-system radar investigations, and a
              wide variety of radio astronomical research.  Recent discoveries made with this
              instrument include the detection of the first planets found in a solar system
              other than our own.

The scientific research carried out at Arecibo is
              supported by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of
              Atmospheric Sciences of the National Science Foundation, as well as by the
              National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
