Abstract    :
                9809281  Kochar    This research analyzes the determinants of the savings and
              portfolio decisions of households in developing economies, using household data
              from rural Pakistan. While there is a body of high quality research on this
              topic, this project will extend this literature in a number of important
              dimensions. First, while much of the existing literature focuses on the effects
              of crop income volatility on savings, this research recognizes that households
              face several other equally important sources of risk. It will distinguish one
              such source, the illness of household members, and contrast the effect of
              ill-health on savings to that of income volatility attributable to other
              sources. Second, it will develop estimates of the uncertainty in individual
              incomes and use these to investigate the responsiveness of savings to such
              uncertainty. Third, it will analyze the role of credit market imperfections in
              explaining portfolio choices. Finally, it proposes to unify the literature on
              the economic role of the household with the savings literature, by allowing the
              determinants of savings to vary across households distinguished by structure.
