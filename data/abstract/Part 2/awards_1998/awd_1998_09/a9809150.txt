The primary objective of the project is to provide new,
              high temporal resolution data on local and regional responses to climate change
              in Alaska during the last 14,000 years.

For this purpose two lacustrine
              sequences in southwest Alaska (Grandfather, Ongivinuk) and detrital input will
              be analyzed by rock magnetic by rock magnetic, chemical and granulometric
              methods.  The high-sensitivity magnetic signal will also be compared with our
              existent (and partly published) pollen and sedimentological records from the
              same sites.  Due to this interdisciplinary approach the quality and complexity
              of the average Late Pleistocene and Holocene climate record of Alaska, now
              dominantly based on pollen data, will be validated and corrected.  In the last
              stage of this project, this improved record will be compared with the climate
              records at similar high latitudes in the North Atlantic and
              Greenland.

Preliminary studies show that short thermal fluctuations during
              the Late Glacial-Holocene transition, the beginning of the Holocene and the
              arrival of a lusher vegetation 7500 years BP are all visible in some of the
              magnetic properties of the target lake sediments.  This indicates that the
              magnetic signal accurately reflects environmental changes.  By using additional
              magnetic proxies, in situ oxidation and reduction processes can be separated
              from the detrital signal, and magnetic grain size can also be estimated. 
              Validating these proxies by chemical elemental analysis, non-magnetic grain
              size determinations, and Mossbauer spectra and comparing these proxies with the
              existing vegetational data, will allow us to reconstruct a high-resolution
              climate record over the last 14,000 years.
