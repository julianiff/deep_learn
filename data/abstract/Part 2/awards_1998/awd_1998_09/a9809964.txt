Abstract    :
              9809964  Zeikus  This project is to investigate: 1) mechanisms responsible for
              enzyme thermal and acid stability; 2) structural features that control enzyme
              activity, substrate specificity, and cofactor specificity; 3) new xylose
              isomerases with different activities and thermo-acid stabilities; 4) strategies
              for creating thermo-acid-stable enzymes and catalytically improved xylose
              isomerases for high fructose corn syrup production; and 5) knowledge about the
              performance of immobilized high temperature enzymes.  The interaction between
              engineering and biochemistry students provided by this project is to be an
              excellent preparation for their future participation in the expanding fields of
              bioprocesing and biotechnology.  ***
