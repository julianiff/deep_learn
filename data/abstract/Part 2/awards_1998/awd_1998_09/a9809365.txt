The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst focuses on fundamental problems in
              polymer science and engineering.  The Center also provides seed funding for new
              opportunities in polymer research.  The Center supports education outreach
              efforts that include collaborations with nearby women's colleges and with
              minority institutions, development of curricular materials for middle-school
              students and outreach to the general public through the National Plastics
              Museum.  The MRSEC also supports shared experimental facilities that are
              accessible to center participants and to outside users, and broad industrial
              outreach efforts.

Research in this MRSEC is organized into two
              interdisciplinary research groups.  One group emphasizes the manipulation of
              polymer morphology by controlled interfacial interactions.  A second group
              explores the use of environmentally benign supercritical carbon dioxide to
              enhance the efficiency of polymer processing.  Participants in the Center
              currently include 24 senior investigators, 6 postdoctoral associates, 23
              graduate students, 10 undergraduates, and 2 technicians and other support
              personnel.  Professor Thomas P. Russell directs the MRSEC.
