Abstract    :
              The research will explain the processes and controls on expansion of western
              juniper in the interior West. Tree-ring information, air photo interpretation,
              and field reconnaissance will be used to compare changes in western juniper
              establishment, cover, density, and growth rates on both semi-relict and nearby
              disturbed sites over a wide range of environmental settings.  Expansion
              processes will be related to changes in climate, land use, and increased levels
              of atmospheric CO2.  The study will record century-scale environmental changes
              within the western juniper community and will provide insight into how land-use
              history and climate change can influence biotic systems.  Management decision
              regarding range lands in the Pacific Northwest will be informed by the results
              of this research.
