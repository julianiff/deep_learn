Abstract    :
              This proposal is to study the critical medical area of ex-vivo expansion of
              bone-marrow stem cells into mature blood cells useful for a variety of
              therapies, e.g., neutrophils to fight infection, platelets for clotting, etc. 
              The research team, which includes bioprocess engineers, a computer-modeling
              expert, and a physician expert in bone-marrow transplantation, will attempt to
              employ metabolic assays (cell-signatures) to characterize these complex
              cultures.  The group has recently developed a mathematical model that can
              discriminate between hypotheses effecting red blood cell cultures and plans to
              extend this model to granulocytes and megakeryocyte lineages.  In order to
              achieve these goals, the group will extensively characterize cell
              proliferation, progenitor cell content, differentiation markers (e.g., surface
              antigen expression), and cell metabolism.
