Abstract    :
              Glacial deposits formed during past expansions of the Patagonian ice fields
              provide a continuous record of southern hemisphere glaciation and climate
              change.  A precise chronology of these mid-latitude glacial advances is
              necessary to determine if climate changes were simultaneous in the northern and
              southern hemispheres, which is a key factor in understanding the triggering
              mechanism(s) for the ice ages.  The common assumption, that glacial advances in
              the Andes were synchronous with North American glaciations, is based on limited
              chronological information.  This award supports a study to obtain a new high
              precision chronology of glacial moraines at Lago Buenos Aires, which record
              Quaternary fluctuations in the Patagonian ice fields.  The moraines are
              extremely well-preserved and have excellent bracketing chronology, due to
              coexisting Ar-dated lava flows, but there is no direct chronology.  This study
              will obtain surface exposure dates, using 3He, 21Ne, 10Be and 36Cl on boulder
              samples from the distinct moraine ridges.  This research will combine field
              efforts for sample collection and a laboratory effort to determine the ages of
              the moraines.
