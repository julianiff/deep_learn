Abstract    :
              Abstract - Pekny - 9809733  The Foundations of Computer Aided Process Operations
              Conference (FOCAPO 98) to be held in Snowbird, Utah from July 5-10, 1998 will
              be the third in a series of conferences dealing with the use of computers in
              support of process operations.  Since the first FOCAPO conference in 1987 and
              second one in 1993, there has been an enormous increase in interest in
              improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process operations.  Since much
              of the restructuring within the process industry over the past few years has
              been operations focused, and given the likely continuation of this trend and
              the host of related research and technical issues, FOCAPO 98 will bring
              together practitioners, management, and researchers for a comprehensive look at
              the state of the art in computer aided process operations, a discussion of
              strategies important to thriving in an environment of continuos change and
              rapidly advancing technology, and the important challenges to be overcome.   
              The program will concentrate on the following themes:    o Advances in the
              Integration of Process Subsystems  o Advances in Quantitative and Qualitative
              Methodologies for Process Operations, Analysis, and Engineering  o Advances in
              Interaction of Tools and Environments for Process Operations  o Integration of
              Operations Goals Including Economic, Quality, and Environmental Concerns  o
              Advanced Computing and Networking for Process Operations  o Human Factors in
              Deploying Advanced Technology
