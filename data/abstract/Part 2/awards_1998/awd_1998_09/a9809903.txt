Abstract    :
                Description: This award is for the support of collaborative research between
              Dr. Hitay Ozbay, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Ohio State University
              in Columbus, and Dr. Altug Iftar, Professor of Electrical Engineering at
              Anadolu University in Eskisehir, Turkey.  The scientists plan to study the
              development of dynamic routing and flow algorithms for high-speed
              data-communication networks.  A team of researchers from Turkey will
              investigate specific routing problems, and the US team will concentrate on flow
              control issues.  For flow control, specific robust control techniques will be
              developed for a generic mathematical model, which is a varying time delay
              system.  The routing controller will be designed with the aim of minimizing
              total delay and queue length, and maximizing the throughput in the network. 
              The ultimate goal of this collaboration is to integrate routing and flow
              control under one design paradigm.  Scope:  This project involves two
              scientists with complementary qualifications.  They will work on different
              aspects of a complex scientific problem to obtain integrated algorithms for
              high speed data-communication networks.  They will study the implementation of
              these algorithms in several important applications.  The two scientists have
              already established a working relationship, so that this collaborative project
              should proceed smoothly and successfully.  The Turkish scientist works at a
              relatively smally university in Turkey, and this project will help establigh
              its linkages to researchers in the United States.  The project fits well within
              the objectives of the Division of International Programs.
