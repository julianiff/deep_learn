This project will complete a dictionary of Montana Salish,
              a Southern Interior Salishan language. It will also include a collection of
              analyzed texts introduced by a grammatical sketch that focuses on explanations
              of the terms and functions of the grammatical morphemes in the texts. 

The
              extensive material in the thousand-page 1877- 79 dictionary of Montana Salish
              will be incorporated into this dictionary in a form that makes it readily
              accessible to linguists.  The database includes systematic coverage of cognates
              from Spokane, a dialect of the same (nameless) language as Montana Salish, and
              from Colville-Okanagan, a closely-related language, as well as numerous
              cognates from other Salishan languages.

Both of these features will make the
              dictionary a valuable resource for historical research on Salishan languages.
              In addition, the l9th-century material, partially re-elicited from current
              speakers, comprises an unusually rich set of elaborate morphological data on a
              polysynthetic language data which, in its present form, can be used only with
              great difficulty. All this material has implications for theoretical concerns
              in a number of areas: historical phonology (e.g. the poorly understood
              phenomenon of irregular sound change), synchronic phonology (e.g. truncation),
              morphology (e.g. the unusually complex overt morphological representation of
              event structure), syntax (e.g. the interplay between pronominal arguments and
              the case marking of NP adjuncts or arguments), and discourse (e.g. the tracking
              of participants in a text). Both the texts and the dictionary files display
              features that are unusual cross-linguistically and in part even within Salishan
              studies.

The dictionary and texts will be published in hard copy, and the
              full dictionary files will be made available through the Web.
