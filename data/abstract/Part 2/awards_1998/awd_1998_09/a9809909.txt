Abstract    :
                9809909  Sheridan  Hormones of the gastoenterpancreatic system play an
              important part in regulating the growth, development, and metabolism of
              animals.  This symposium will bring together scientists fro molecular biology,
              cellular biology and organismal biology to provide an integrated synthesis of
              the function and evolution of this important group of chemical mediators in
              vertebrate and invertebrate organisms.  This symposium is in honor of Dr. Erika
              Pisetskaya, Research Professor Emeritus, who has had a long and distinguished
              career and who has contributed so much to the fields of comparative
              endocrinology and comparative physiology/biochemistry.  The symposium will have
              both oral and poster sessions.  Ten invited speakers will deliver oral
              presentations while postdoctoral fellows or graduate students fro the
              laboratories of each of the speakers will present posters as a means to
              encourage the participation of young scientists.  The proceedings from the
              proposed symposium will be published in the American Zoologist by a peer review
              process.     Dr. Sheridan hopes to foster a broader discussion and integrated
              synthesis of the comparative structures and functions of these chemical
              mediators in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms.  In addition, the
              relationship of the hormones of the enteropancreatic systems will be discussed
              in relationship of these factors and hormones in other systems will be
              discussed in relationship of these factors and hormones in other systems such
              as the central nervous system.
