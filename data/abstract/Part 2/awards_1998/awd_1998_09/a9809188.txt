Abstract    :
              The concept of defensive projection suggests that when people are motivated to
              avoid seeing certain faults in themselves, they contrive instead to see those
              same faults in others. This concept helps to explain why many people regard
              their rivals and opponents as exploitative and unscrupulous, and also how
              people form stereotypes of groups whose members they scarcely know. In this
              project, a new framework is being developed for understanding when and how
              people become prone to seeing in other people the qualities they would least
              like in themselves. The research is aimed at developing a deeper understanding
              of the relationship between trait possession and defensive projection.
              Projection plays an important role in interpersonal problems. Similarly, other
              social scientists have speculated that projection is a psychological process
              that contributes to intergroup hostility and conflict. Designing effective
              interventions to ameliorate the pain and distress caused by projection will
              depend on a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying it and the
              circumstances in which it is likely to occur.
