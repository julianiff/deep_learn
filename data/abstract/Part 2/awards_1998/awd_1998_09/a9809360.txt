Abstract Soils are a great source ofbiodiversity on
              earth due to its heterogeneous chemical and physical properties. In this study,
              the first comprehensive examination of prokaryotes and their viruses, will be
              perfomed in an extreme thermal soil (temperature range 60-85C) located in
              Yellowstone National Park. Prokaryotes and their viruses are inextricably tied
              and understanding their relationships in this environment promises a new view
              ofthermophily and evolution. Molecular techniques will examine phylogenetic
              relationships of thermal soil prokaryotes and their viruses, and extreme
              thermophiles and viruses will be isolated using traditional culturing methods
              and novel methods that take advantage of the flow-through properties of a
              bio~lm reactor and a soil chemostat. Information derived from this study will
              expand our understanding of the distribution of thermophily in the microbial
              world and will be of fundamental importance to science. The knowledge and
              resources gained from this study are predicted to be of significant value to
              the biotechnology industry.
