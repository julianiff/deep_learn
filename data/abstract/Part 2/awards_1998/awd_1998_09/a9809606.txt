Abstract    :
              9809606  Charles    This award supports the establishment of the Diatom
              Paleolimnology Data Cooperative (DPDC).   Diatoms are used widely to infer
              climate characteristics from lake sediment cores.  New methods  for inferring
              past climatic conditions are developing rapidly,  and many diatom-based studies
              are  addressing key climate issues.  The purpose of the DPDC is to both 1)
              provide the climate  change community with improved and more accessible
              estimates of past temperature,  precipitation, water chemistry, lake level and
              hydrologic characteristics, and 2) provide diatom  paleolimnologists with data
              that will significantly improve their ability to produce such estimates.     In
              addition to ecological data, the DPDC is designed to contain the climate
              related inferences  from diatom paleolimnology studies of sediment cores. 
              Long- and short-term values of inferred  salinity, lake level, and other
              characteristics are very useful to paleoclimate researchers for  understanding
              past climate systems and for developing and evaluating climate models.  All
              data  will be stored in a standard format.  It will be freely available to the
              scientific community.  ***
