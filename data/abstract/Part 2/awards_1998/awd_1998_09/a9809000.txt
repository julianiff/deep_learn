Abstract    :
              Recent research has demonstrated the automaticity of much of social perception.
              Stereotypes have been found to become active automatically upon the presence of
              the group features (e.g., skin color, gender), and behaviors have been found to
              be automatically categorized in trait terms. In recent research, the PI
              expanded on these findings to investigate other direct and preconscious effects
              that the social environment has on psychological phenomena. The current project
              addresses the next natural question: What is the adaptive significance of these
              various automatic responses to the environment? One possibility is that they
              serve a general signaling or appraisal function. Another is that they help
              smooth social interactions. This research investigates the influence of
              preconscious thought processes, such as those triggered by particular
              situations and racial groups, on behaviors, such as task persistence and
              hostility, which occur without the person's awareness of why they are behaving
              that way. As such, this research is studying the mechanism of unconscious
              motivations. Among the implications of this work will be insights into the
              pervasiveness of discrimination against certain groups and the prospects for
              change.
