Abstract    :
              The International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) contains hundreds of tree-ring
              data sets that are useful for the study of climate variability and change,
              including attribution studies of possible climate forcing by greenhouse gases. 
              The mean annual tree-ring chronologies, however, which are typically used in
              dendroclimatic studies, do not include associated meta-data that explain how
              the chronologies were developed from the raw data.  This award supports
              re-standardizing the most important  subset of tree-ring data sets for climate
              studies in the ITRDB, i.e. those that begin on or before 1700.  The important
              features of the tree-ring chronologies will be documented as they relate to the
              conservation of low-frequency climate variability.  These re-standardized
              tree-ring chronologies will be placed in the ITRDB as a separate, enhanced,
              full-documented library that will be freely available to the scientific
              community.
