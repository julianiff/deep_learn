Ocean science faculty from the California State University and
              community college systems in the San Francisco bay area have developed the
              Ocean Network of Science Educators using Technology (ONSET), a program for the
              enhancement of K-16 science education through the use of technology and
              field-based methods.  A pilot program of ONSET will introduce teachers to the
              ocean sciences through a series of workshops, coastal and sea-going field
              excursions, and school site visits.  Teachers will be assisted in developing
              innovative curricula that combine the best attributes of technology-enhanced
              and field-based instructional methods.  World Wide Web (WWW) technology will be
              used to develop a cummunity of teachers to share classroom resources that
              incorporate inquiry-based methods in student learning.  Six days of teacher
              workshops, divided evenly between electronic and field-based concentrations,
              will be held in 1999, culminating in the fall 1999 ONSET conference at the Bay
              Conference Center of the Romberg-Tiburon Center where marine research
              scientists will discuss educational outreach projects and current research
              issues with local educators, including potential future participants in the
              ONSET program.
