The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
              the University of Colorado supports a research program on ferroelectric liquid
              crystals, as well as a wide range of educational activities, including K-8
              outreach.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities,
              which are accessible to outside users and also supports interactive efforts
              with industry and other sectors.   The research is focused on three areas. 
              These include the study of the molecular structure and macroscopic properties
              of liquid crystals; the control of interfaces and surfaces of liquid crystals
              with the goal to advance potential device applications; and the study of
              polymers and gels, which seeks to develop glassy liquid crystals for nonlinear
              optical applications.  Participants in the Center currently include 10 senior
              investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 10 graduate students and 12
              technicians and other support personnel.   Professor Noel A. Clark directs the
              MRSEC.
