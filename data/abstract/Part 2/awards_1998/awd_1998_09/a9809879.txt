The structures of a number of filamentous plant viruses
              will be determined in molecular detail, using fiber diffraction methods.  The
              viruses to be studied include two tobamoviruses, odontoglossum ringspot virus
              (ORSV) and sunn-hemp mosaic virus (SHMV), and members of the furovirus,
              potexvirus, and potyvirus groups.  Structures of the tobamoviruses will be
              determined by molecular replacement, using the known structure of tobacco
              mosaic virus (TMV).  The other structures will be determined de novo, using
              methods developed in P.I.'s laboratory.  All structures will be refined using
              molecular dynamics methods, as adapted in P.I.'s laboratory for use with fiber
              diffraction data.  The structures to be determined will be important in
              understanding the molecular characteristics of viruses, and will advance
              understanding of viral assembly and disassembly, viral-host interactions and
              specificity, and vector transmission, as well as the relationship between
              structure and the rapid evolution of RNA viruses.

              are of increasing importance in biotechnology.  Potexviruses and especially
              potyviruses are of major agricultural importance.
