Abstract    :
              Description: This award is for the support of a collaborative research by Dr.
              Clifford Pollock, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Cornell University and
              Dr. Alphan Sennaroglu, Assistant Professor of Physics at Koc University in
              Istanbul, Turkey.  The scientists aim at developing a room temperature, broadly
              tunable solid-state laser based on chromium-doped zinc selenide (Cr:Z-S).  This
              laser will be suitable for applications such as remote sensing, LIDAR, and
              medical diagnosis.  They will investigate ways of pumping the laser crystals
              using powerful continuous wave lasers, and explore methods for improving the
              Cr:Z-S crystal quality to reduce optical losses.  They also plan to investigate
              Cr:Z-S waveguide structures, which would accommodate diode laser pumping.    
              Scope:  This project will support collaboration between a recognized leader in
              the field of optoelectronics and a young scientist at a new university in
              Turkey.  The Turkish scientist received his Ph.D. degree four years ago under
              the P.I.'s supervision, and has since done significant research work, with
              important publications in the field, since his graduation.  It is expected that
              this project will enable the two scientists to resume collaboration, this time
              between their respective laboratories, to their mutual benefit.  The project
              fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.
