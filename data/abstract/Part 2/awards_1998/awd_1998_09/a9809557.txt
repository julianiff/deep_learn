Abstract    :
              9809557  The PI's propose to revise the content and pedagogy of undergraduate
              instruction in sedimentary geology to highlight the broad application of
              sedimentary geology and enhance the relevance of the material for future
              geoscientists.  The primary goal is to shift from an approach that emphasizes
              classification and memorization skills to a contextual problem-solving approach
              that emphasizes critical thinking and communication skills. The PI's will also
              produce a model course complete with web-based and hardcopy materials that can
              be adopted at other institutions.  The University of Oklahoma is providing
              substantial cost-sharing for this project.
