Abstract    :
              The similarity between attributional (lazy, hard-working, bright) and labeling
              (father, murderer, professional) processes offers a promising point of
              rapprochement between psychological and sociological social psychology. Affect
              control theory (ACT) offers a falsifiable synthesis of the two social
              psychologies. The theory allows for rigorous operationalization of fundamental
              concepts underlying both disciplinary approaches: balance theories, theories of
              equity and justice, symbolic interactionism, dramaturgical studies, person
              perception studies, theories of emotions, etc. A newly created version of ACT
              indicates that Japanese use different schemata for characterizing social
              identities. That is, ACT models indicate that the Japanese employ an entirely
              different set of heuristics than used by Americans for making sense of common,
              everyday experiences. These findings led to the question of whether the
              Japanese model is representative of the larger Northeast Asian culture from
              which the Japanese people derive, or does it portray a unique culture? This
              proposal offers a series of five experiments to test these competing
              hypotheses. The methods employ the semantic differential through a computerized
              program called ATTITUDE that randomizes stimuli, scale endpoints, and scale
              dimensions to reduce typical interviewee biases and errors. The design reduces
              collinearity problems in the derivation of the regression equations
              representing the impression-formation processes of any particular culture.
              Because the Japanese and American equations have predictive validity
              approaching 90%, there is every reason to expect that a Chinese version of ACT
              should prove as successful.
