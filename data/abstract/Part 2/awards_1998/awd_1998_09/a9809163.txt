Abstract    :
              ***  9809163  Shen       This award will provide partial support for the
              Fourteenth International Symposium on Ice, to be convened at Clarkson
              University, Potsdam, New York, in July 1998.  The symposium will provide a
              forum for the presentation and discussion of current results of original
              research in sea, lake, and river ice processes, ice mechanics and geophysics,
              ice engineering, and ecological and environmental problems in cold regions. 
              These symposia are typically held at venues where there is a center of
              excellence in cold regions research; they have been held previously in the
              United States in 1986 at the University of Iowa, and in 1975 at Dartmouth
              College.  The expected attendance at the symposium is approximately two hundred
              international scientists.    ***
