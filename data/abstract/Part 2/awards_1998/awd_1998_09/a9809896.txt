Abstract    :
              9809896  Shepherd    Professor Ursula Shepherd of the General Honors Program of 
              the University of New Mexico and her counterparts in  Australia, including Dr.
              John A. Ludwig of the Tropical  Ecosystems Research Center, CSIRO, Darwin, will
              provide a  summer research experience in tropical biology in the summer  of
              1998 for twelve American undergraduate students and two  graduate students. 
              The students will visit CSIRO research  facilities near Kakadu National Park
              where they will assist  Drs. John Ludwig and Rosalind Blanche in their ongoing
              work  on tropical savannas.  They will also receive lectures from  Australian
              researchers and visit a number of ecological and  cultural sites.  Upon their
              return to New Mexico, they will  conduct a symposium at which they will present
              the results  of their work.
