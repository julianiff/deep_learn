Longley
In this RUI  proposal Prof. Longley  requests support for
              participation  in the MACRO and MINOS  Collaborations for himself and two
              undergraduate students. Both of these efforts have components directed toward
              the study of neutrino oscillations, one from cosmic rays, the other from an
              accelerator beam.
