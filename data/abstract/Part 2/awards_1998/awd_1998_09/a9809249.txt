Abstract    :
              Organizations often look to other organizations as models for what they do. 
              Recent research has shown organizations sometimes imitate the most common
              practices ( frequency imitation), the practices of large or prestigious
              organizations (trait imitation), or practices that appear to have a good
              outcome (outcome imitation).  Most important work in this area has assumed that
              if many organizations imitate, they will all tend to look alike over time. 
              This research explores the important contrasting possibility that imitation can
              lead to innovation and complexity in practices, rather than similarity.  The
              paper uses inductive, qualitative analysis of fine grained interview data from
              a two year study of 40 manufacturing firms in three industries, and a sample of
              14 universities in seven countries.  We will examine (1) whether organizations
              use more than one imitation rule, (and produce new mixes of practices) (2)
              whether they combine different rules in patterned ways (producing systematic
              patterns in mixes of practices) and (3) what impact the imitation processes
              have on (a) innovation at the organizational level (b) innovation at the level
              of whole groups of organizations (organizational populations).  The research
              will contribute to scholarly research on vicarious learning by organizations
              and population level learning by advancing understanding of how new bundles of
              practices arise in populations of organizations.  It will have value to
              practitioners as well.  For example, contemporary firms often 'benchmark' other
              organizations.  This research will suggest conditions under which adopting
              practices form other organizations will be more likely to create unintended
              problems or advantages for both the imitating organization and the industry to
              which belongs.
