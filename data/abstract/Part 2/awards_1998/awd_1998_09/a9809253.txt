Abstract    :
              9809253  Hemming    This project will analyze Nd isotopes in ferromanganese 
              precipitates from Atlantic Ocean Sediments spanning the last 
              glacial/interglacial cycle. The authors propose that Nd  offers advantages as
              tracer of deepwater circulation because  it is unaffected by biologic
              processes.  Depth transects of  cores spanning the modern ranges of North
              Atlantic Deep  Water and Antarctic Bottom Water will be analyzed in the  Cape
              Basin, The Rio Grande Rise, the Ceara Rise, and the  Blake-Bahama-Bermuda Rise
              regions.  Isotopic ratios will be  compared with known water-column values, and
              mineralogic and  geochemical tests will be used to develop criteria to 
              identify unaltered material.  Samples from glaical and  interglacial periods
              will be compared to assess previous  inferences of deep water circulation
              derived by other  techniques.
