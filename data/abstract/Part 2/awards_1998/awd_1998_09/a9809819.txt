Abstract    :
                Creek is a member of the Muskogean language family with some 4,000, mostly
              elderly speakers residing in three communities: the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of
              eastcentral Oklahoma, the Seminole Nation of central Oklahoma, and the Brighton
              Reservation within the Seminole Tribe of Florida. This project seeks to
              document these three dialects by expanding an existing corpus of Creek texts
              and by using the corpus to create the first modern reference grammar of the
              language. The resulting textbase will allow researchers to perform linguistic
              analysis and read transcriptions or translations of documents. The reference
              grammar will provide information on the phonetics, phonology, morphology, and
              syntax of the language while paying special attention to matters of theoretical
              interest to linguists, including the description of stress, tone, syllable
              structure, 'active' agreement,  switch reference, grammatical relations, voice,
              directionals, and external possession. The resulting materials will contribute
              to comparative and historical studies of Muskogean languages, to theoretical
              work in linguistics, and to community efforts to learn and maintain the
              language.
