The P.I.s propose to continue their collaborative research
              aimed at understanding the dynamics and fine structure of the lowermost mantle
              using integrated seismological and geodynamic methodologies.  Two dimensional
              and regional spherical geodynamic models are being used to study the dynamics
              of  (a) strong, cold slabs interacting with thermo-chemical boundary layers and
              phase changes in which slabs have internal lithologic layering and (b)
              upwelling regions with large variations in viscosity, partial melting, and
              chemical heterogeneity.  In all cases, these thermo-chemical structures are
              mapped into seismic velocity fields from which they calculate synthetic
              waveforms.  Dynamic models are directly tested against observed waveforms,
              differential travel times, and tomography.
