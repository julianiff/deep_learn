Abstract    :
                  9809961  Dearing  A fundamental goal in the study of the ecology of
              mammalian herbivores has been to identify the physiological factors that limit
              dietary specialization.  Although plant secondary compounds have played a
              paramount role in the generation of diet selection hypotheses of mammalian
              herbivores and detoxification capability is often proposed as a mechanism
              determining diet breadth, our understanding of how herbivores detoxify
              secondary compounds is quite limited.  To generate diet selection models with
              more predictive power and to understand the ecological distributions of
              herbivorous mammals, we first need to improve our knowledge of the mammalian
              detoxification system.  The objective of the proposed research is to identify
              and quantify the mechanisms that specialist and generalist herbivores use to
              detoxify plant secondary compounds by testing the following 3 hypotheses: by
              producing detoxification metabolites that are less acidic than those produced
              by generalists; by generating the same acid-load during detoxification as
              generalists, however, eliminating hydrogen ions (H+) produced in this process
              through an entirely different route than generalists; and by having a greater
              capacity to buffer urine than generalists.
