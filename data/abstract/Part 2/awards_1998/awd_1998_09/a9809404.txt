Abstract    :
              The rapid proliferation of new instruction set architectures that  support
              instruction-level parallel processing has created great  compiler and
              microarchitecture research opportunities.  The IMPACT  compiler, with its
              advanced features such as predicated  compilation, instruction level
              parallelism optimizations, compiler  engineered speculation, profile-based
              optimizations, advanced  machine description facilities, scheduling frameworks
              for resource  sensitive code optimizations, and pointer-based dependence 
              analysis and tracking facility, has become a premier compiler  technology base
              for major U.S. companies as well as academic  researchers.  This software
              capitalization project enables the use  of IMPACT's state-of-the-art compiler
              framework by a large number  of researchers.  This will be accomplished by
              enhancing existing  documentation and developing new documentation and
              tutorials,  further strengthening the software interfaces, building and 
              maintaining a web-based support infrastructure, and making the  software as
              stable as possible through the aggressive use of a  regression-test environment
              and timely response to users' bug  reports.  This project's software and
              documentation will be  released in several phases over two years and the end
              product will  be a high-quality and readily-available compiler environment that
               supports a wide variety of advanced instruction-level  parallel processing
              research.
