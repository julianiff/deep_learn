The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
              the University of Minnesota supports a broad research program foucsed on hybrid
              materials.  The Center is organized through two interdisciplinary research
              groups, and pursues exploratory research in several seed projects.  The MRSEC
              supports an educational outreach program to the Native American community in a
              four-state area surrounding the University of Minnesota.  The Center maintains
              shared experimental facilities which are accessible to outside users, and also
              supports interactive efforts with industry and other sectors.  One of the two
              interdisciplinary research groups is investigating the microstructure of
              macromolecular materials.  This group seeks to employ block co-polymers as key
              ingredients, but rarely as sole ingredients, in order to control the structure
              and function of new hybrid polymers.  The goal of the second group is to
              develop a fundamental understanding of the materials science of artificial
              tissues and to develop materials for use in biosystems.  An important aspect of
              this work is to define systematically the relationships betweeen composition,
              structure, and mechanical properties of arificial tissues.  Participants in the
              Center include approximately 20 senior investigators, 9 postdoctoral
              associates, 21 graduate students, 10 undergraduates, and 1 support person.  
              Professors Michael D. Ward and Frank S. Bates serve as Center Directors
