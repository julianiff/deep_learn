Abstract    :
              9809924  Friedman    This Americas Program award will fund a Latin American 
              Symposium on Mathematical logic, to be held in Merida,  Venezuela, July 6-10,
              1998.   Organizers are Dr. Sy D.  Friedman, Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology, (M.I.T.),  and Dr. Carlos A. Di Prisco, Instituto Venezolano de 
              Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC).  The meeting brings  together some of the
              top researchers in logic from the  United States and other countries. 
              Participants will  include a diverse group of junior and senior researchers 
              from a wide range of geographical areas and universities  within the United
              States and the rest of the world.  It will  provide an opportunity for young
              researchers from US and  Latin America to gain knowledge of current research in
              their  field, and at the same time, forge  relationships with each  other that
              may lead to future research collaborations..  Logic is a broad field, and each
              of its principal subfields,  Theory, Model Theory, Recursion Theory, and Proof
              Theory,  will be represented in the discussions and presentations.  The meeting
              will be preceded by short courses aimed at  enhancing the benefits that the
              graduate students and young  researchers will derive from the meeting.  ***
