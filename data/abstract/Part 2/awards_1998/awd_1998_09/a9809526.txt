Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to develop a detailed geochronology and to conduct
              reconnaissance paleolimnological proxy analyses on a unique suite of six
              sediment cores from an isolated,  slow-sedimentation rate, interbasinal ridge
              in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Initial work suggests that sedimentation rates
              at this locality are an order of magnitude slower than any other site cored in
              the African rift valley lakes, and the oldest sediments in these cores may be
              as much as 100,000 years in age.  No comparable high-quality,  high-resolution,
              continuous paleoclimate records of such duration are available for the interior
              of equatorial Africa. Scientists will examine evidence of a 10 kyr "double"
              precessional cycle in the Lake Tanganyika paleolimnological record and to what
              extent the tempo of Northern Hemisphere ice volume fluctuation dominates the
              Lake Tanganyika system.   This project is being conducted under the auspices of
              the IDEAL program (International Decade for the East African Lakes).
