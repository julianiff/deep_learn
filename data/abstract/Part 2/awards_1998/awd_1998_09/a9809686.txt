The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at the University of Kentucky focuses on the synthesis, characterization and
              applications of carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and nanotube and fullerene
              composites.  The Center also provides seed funding for new opportunities in
              related areas.  The Center supports efforts in materials education at all
              levels, including summer undergraduate research experiences and short courses
              and workshops on carbon materials. The MRSEC also supports shared experimental
              facilities that are accessible to center participants and to outside users, and
              has strong research collaborations with other universities and industrial
              laboratories.

Research in the University of Kentucky MRSEC is organized in
              an interdisciplinary research group that addresses the science and applications
              of advanced carbon materials.  Participants in the Center currently include 10
              senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral associates, 18 graduate students, and 1
              administrative support staff.  Professor Robert C. Haddon directs the
              MRSEC.
