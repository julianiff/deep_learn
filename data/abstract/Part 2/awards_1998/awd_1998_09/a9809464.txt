Abstract    :
                  9809464  LeClere    The objective of this dissertation improvement award is
              to assess the recent changes in hospital nursing staff and their impact on the
              quality of patient care. The staffing changes examined are levels of nursing
              staff per acuity-adjusted patient day, and nursing staff mix. Quality is
              measured through three patient outcomes indicators: mortality, readmissions and
              infection rates. Factors controlled for include patient acuity and hospital
              characteristics.  Three secondary data sets are utilized, two from yearly
              staffing and utilization records from all Pennsylvania hospitals for 1992-1996,
              and the third from all patient records in these hospitals over the same period.
               Two methods are utilized to analyze the data. Repeated cross-sectional
              analysis assesses the relationship of patient outcomes to nurse staffing. Time
              series analysis assesses the percent change in outcomes given the changes in
              staffing.   This research is of immediate importance. Since 1994, nurses and
              patients have perceived a decline in staffing levels and in the quality of
              patient care. Yet there has been no large-scale study of the changes. Past
              research has been cross-sectional only, focusing on patient mortality. In 1996,
              the Institute of Medicine reported a lack of research in this area and
              recommended its funding.
