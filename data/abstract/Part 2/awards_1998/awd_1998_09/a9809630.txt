Abstract    :
              98-09630  Proposal Summary:  The PI proposes to create a World Wide Web site
              that will allow the general public to follow the experiences of oceanographers
              during an NSF-funded cruise.  The research cruise is scheduled for the Fall of
              1998 off the coast of Hawaii. Scientists will be surveying the Puna Ridge, a
              submarine ridge that is part of the currently erupting Kilauea Volcano.  The
              web site will contain background information on the ship, scientists, and
              research project as well as teaching modules relating to Hawaiian geology,
              shipboard activities, scientific data collection, etc.  Pre-cruise activities
              will also include advertisement of the project.  During the four-week cruise,
              daily updates of scientific activities and discoveries will be posted to the
              web site.  Post cruise activities will include repackaging the web site from a
              real-time event to an educational/fieldwork resource and production of a
              CD-ROM.
