The goal of this project is integration of thermal and kinetic
              models with seismological data for subduction zones that exhibit seismological
              evidence for sluggish transformation of basalt and gabbro to eclogite.  The PIs
              begin by producing a kinematic thermal model that yields transient and
              steady-state thermal structures and the pressure-temperature-time evolution of
              the subducting slab and overlying mantle wedge.  Next, equilibrium and kinetic
              phase transformation models are used to predict mineral assemblages, densities,
              and seismic wave speeds.  The calculated velocity structure is then evaluated
              by its ability to predict observed seismic properties of waveform dispersion
              and converted phase amplitudes.  Misfit between the petrologically predicted
              and the seismologically observed velocity structure is then minimized by
              iterative repetition.  If the assumption is made that high fluid pressures are
              required for intermediate depth earthquakes, then the loci of dehydration
              reactions and the resultant volatile flux can also be used to predict
              hypocenter locations and compared to observed earthquake hypocenters.  The
              resulting integrated model of the thermal, petrological, and seismological
              properties of subducting slabs will yield further insight into other plate
              boundary processes such as intermediate-depth earthquakes, arc magmatism, and
              the recycling of volatiles.
