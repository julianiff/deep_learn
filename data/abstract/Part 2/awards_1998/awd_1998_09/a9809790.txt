Abstract ATM-9809790 Moore, Andrew M. University of Colorado Title:
              Understanding the Physical Basis of ENSO, ENSO Predictability, and their
              Relationship to Intraseasonal Variability, Using a Hierarchy of Coupled
              Atmosphere-Ocean Models This research has two objectives (i) to examine the
              potential impact of intraseasonal variability on the ENSO cycle (ii) to develop
              stochastic-dynamic forecast methods for ENSO. Five different models (4
              intermediate, 1 hybrid coupled) will be used to study the physical factors that
              strongly influence the non-normal nature of the equatorial Pacific coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system, and thus its predictability. The proposed work is
              important since it will shed insights into various aspects of the ENSO
              phenomenon.
