Abstract    :
              NISHIKAWA  9809942        As functional morphologists and neurobiologists, the
              PIs wish to  predict how patterns of muscle activation should change, not only
              when an  individual performs different tasks but also during its lifetime as it
               grows, and as body proportions change during evolution. These tasks are 
              currently beyond the PIs reach because patterns of muscle activation are 
              affected by a large number of factors, including the contractile properties  of
              the muscles, their mechanical advantage, the masses and lengths of the 
              segments, and the force, velocity and duration of movement. Unraveling the 
              complexity of muscle activation is an important basic problem of organismal 
              biology. The goal of the proposed research is to develop prey capture in  frogs
              as a model system for investigating this problem. In this proposal,  the PIs
              seek funds to develop biornechanical models that will predict how  body size
              and morphological evolution affect patterns of muscle activation;  and for
              empirical studies that will be used to modify the models and test  their
              predictions. These studies will contribute significantly to the  development of
              a theoretical framework in which the effects of body size  and morphological
              evolution on patterns of muscle activation can be  predicted and ultimately
              tested.
