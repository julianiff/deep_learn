Abstract    :
                  The Fallen Leaf Lake Conference, held near South Lake Tahoe, California, 
              began in 1985 under the sponsorship of the University of California, Davis to
              promote and foster advances in molecular microbiology and microbial diversity. 
              The conference for 1998 is titled "Unifying Themes Among Protein and Nucleic
              Acid Transporters of Bacteria".  Gram negative pathogens of plants and animals
              contain as part of their repertoire of virulence determinants a group of
              conserved genes.  These genes encode protein secretory systems which can
              translocate their protein substrates directly from the bacterium into the host
              eukaryotic cell.  The translocation is contact-activated.  These properties are
              shared by another class of macromolecular transporters, the plasmid conjugative
              systems of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria.  In these systems the
              transporters are responsible for translocating a DNA molecule, as a
              nucleoprotein complex, from the donor bacterium to a suitable recipient (in the
              case of Agrobacterium tumefacians, the recipient is a plant cell).  This
              conference will explore recent work from many laboratories suggesting that
              remarkable similarities exist between these protein secretion and nucleic acid
              transporters and the genes encoding them.    The organizing committee consists
              of scientists from Europe and the United States.  As with all Fallen Leaf Lake
              Conferences, both established and young emerging scientists participate and
              interact.  With the permission of the authors, the abstracts will appear in a
              major international journal.
