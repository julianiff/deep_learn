Abstract    :
              9809947  Chang    The purpose of this planning meeting is to plan an 
              international workshop in materials research which will take  place at the end
              of 1998. Participants in the planning  meeting will include researchers and
              government agency  representatives from the region including China, Taiwan, 
              Singapore, Australia, Korea, Japan and the United States.  The purpose of the
              workshop itself is to identify specific  areas for fruitful U.S.-Asia
              cooperation in the  interdisciplinary area of materials research and to 
              recommend how the supporting U.S. and Asian government  agencies can help in
              the development of increased  cooperation in the international research
              community through  the formation of an Asia-Pacific Materials Research Network.
