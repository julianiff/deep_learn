Abstract    :
              9809624  Eglington         This project will compare AMS C dates derived from
              four  components of marine sediments: taxon-specific lipids, total  organic
              matter, foraminifera and fine-grained calcite.  Sediment samples will be taken
              from the anoxic Cariaco  Basin, Bermuda Rise, and modern Antarctic material.
              The  project will test the utility of lipids for determining  reliable dates
              and assess the importance of bioturbational  mixing in blurring chronologies
              and compromising the  interpretation of coupled organic-inorganic proxy
              records.
