              Abstract  ATM-9809230  Jacoby, Gordon C.  Columbia University  Title:
              Dendroclimatology of Arctic Siberia    This award supports a dendroclimatologic
              investigation of Arctic  Siberia.  The main objectives of this project are to
              extend the  environmental record in the Arctic and thus provide a better 
              framework to evaluate climatic recent trends and variations.  The  extended
              record will be used in regional and hemispheric climatic  reconstructions to
              study effects of volcanic, solar, and trace gas  factors on climate as
              expressed by climate models. This project  will provide extended paleoclimatic
              data to a relatively unknown  region of the Arctic, where global change warming
              may be most  pronounced.
