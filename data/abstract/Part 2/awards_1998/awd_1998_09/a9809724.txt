Abstract    :
              9809724  The PI proposes to develop a set of five virtual applications and web
              sites related to geoscience education, including 1)Radioactive dating
              techniques, 2) groundwater hydrology, 3) earthquakes, 4) coastal wave
              refraction, longshore currents and littoral drift modeling, 5) slope stability
              modeling for landslides. Development of these virtual courseware will involve a
              team of faculty members and website and computer programmers. The PI will also
              involve the staff of the Center for Usability in Design and Assessment to help
              assess the effectiveness of the computer interface designs.  The PI plans to
              make this project available on one of their four web servers. These web servers
              currently handle between 60-90,000 accesses per day from about 2000-3000
              students for two existing virtual programs designed by the PI.
