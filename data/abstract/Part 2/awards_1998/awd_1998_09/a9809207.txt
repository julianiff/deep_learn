Abstract    :
              A fundamental problem facing most real-world decision-making groups is the
              uneven distribution of decision-relevant information among members. Due to
              differences in day-to-day experience, formal training, and work roles, some
              group members frequently encounter a certain amount of decision-relevant
              information that others in the group do not possess. This uniquely held
              knowledge is referred to as unshared information, and stands in contrast to
              shared information that many group members hold. Despite the potential value of
              this unshared information, past research has consistently shown that groups
              tend to make decisions that are more consistent with the implications of their
              shared rather than their unshared information. The purpose of the current
              research is to investigate the proposition that group members who possess more
              widely shared information actually have greater influence in decision making
              groups than do group members who possess less widely shared information. The
              research will provide new insight into the processes and problems associated
              with distributed information in decision-making groups. A better understanding
              of the problems faced by decision-making groups will facilitate the development
              of methods for overcoming those problems in the future. The research also
              contributes to the Knowledge Networking focus of NSF's Knowledge and
              Distributed Intelligence (KDI) initiative.
