Abstract    :
                This Award for Beginning Academics grant will enable the Principal
              Investigator to begin to examine the evolution of the African American
              Vernacular English (AAVE) vowel system through an acoustic analysis of
              mechanical recordings of 90 African Americans with birth years ranging from
              1844 to 1985, in comparison with white speakers from the same birth cohorts and
              the same or nearby communities.    The first stage of the project, which the
              present grant covers, will be consultation with a recognized expert in
              laboratory phonetics, who will help the PI to address the following specific
              problems:  How is the perception of variants in AAVE related to the acoustic
              data?  What speech synthesis equipment, and what experimental design, should be
              employed to test the relative importance of different variations in speech in
              identifying the speaker as African American or as white?  What state-of-the-art
              techniques in laboratory phonetics are most suitable for acoustic analysis of
              the type required for sociolinguistic research?  Following the consultation
              period, the PI will begin the analysis of the recordings.
