Abstract    :
                 This three year project extension is designed to advance the comparative
              study of Mixe Zoquean (MZ) and Zapotecan (Zn) languages. It extends and
              completes a project begun on a smaller scale in 1994 and turned into a large
              scale project for 1995 1998. The project aims to produce dictionaries and text
              collections for the 10 MZ languages and 11 of the perhaps 20 Zn languages (with
              representation from all the branches). This data is needed to provide the
              foundation both for comparative reconstruction and for subsequent grammatical
              description.  The dictionaries classify morphemes and stems in great detail,
              and document ethnobiology, names, and sound symbolism. The lexical collections
              are electronically databased. Dictionaries will be posted on the WorldWideWeb
              and  will also appear as printed books. The dictionaries produced by this
              project are more extensive than any otherwise available, having 4500 to 6000
              entries.  The proposed work is significant in several areas. Both MZ and Zn
              languages have structural properties of interest to current linguistic theory,
              although they are structurally highly dissimilar. Notably, MZ has ergativity
              and OV morphosyntax, and Zn has tones and an often opaque system of prefixes
              and proclitics on verbs. The project has the potential to make a major
              contribution to early Mesoamerican cultural and linguistic history; MZ
              languages were spoken by Olmecs, and were influential at the Olmec era and
              subsequently in affecting many other languages in the area. It contributes to
              the ongoing decipherment of epi Olmec wnting; the interpretation of its texts
              depends heavily upon MZ comparative studies, which were crucial in the original
              decipherment. Zn comparative studies, though lagging behind MZ studies, are
              already advancing the decipherment of Oaxacan writing. Finally, it includes a
              major language salvage operation, helping to preserve an important part of the
              linguistic heritage of the Americas.
