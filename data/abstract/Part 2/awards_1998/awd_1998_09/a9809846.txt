Abstract    :
                This project extends an ongoing study of homicides in New York City across 200
              years.  An unexpected finding from that research was that nineteenth century
              age rates of  homicide victims and perpetrators were flat across the age range
              17-55. This difference may have obtained during the mid twentieth century.
              Current data indicate that the rate peaks during this age period.  Of verify
              and replicate this result, the current research will collect data at additional
              sites across the united states. The purpose of the project, therefore, is to
              determine if it is a general phenomenon or unique to a few locations and eras. 
              In addition, the results will assist in differentiating how much of the changes
              in homicide are due to changes in demographic composition of the City and how
              much is due to changes in behavior. Qualitative and regression analyses are
              being used.   If changes in over all homicide rates are driven by age rate
              offending as well as basic demographic composition of the population, violence
              researchers will need an more complex analysis than previously presumed. 
              Results of this work have already had and are expected to continue to have a
              major impact on sociolegal theorizing about the factors that contribute to
              violence and to policy makers who hope to intervene to reduce violence.   %%%
