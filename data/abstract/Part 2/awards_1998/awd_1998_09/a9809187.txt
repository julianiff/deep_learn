Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University to   upgrade the nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) facilities, by increasing   the technical capabilities
              of the instruments and by improving the   efficiency of performing routine and
              more complex multi-dimensional   experiments.  These upgrades will facilitate
              research in a number of   areas, including 1) natural products structure
              determination; 2) design   and synthesis of peptide and nucleic acid analogs;
              3) novel peptide and   polymer architectures; 4) biomolecular NMR; 5) chemistry
              of organic   curved surfaces; 6) organic materials chemistry; and molecular  
              recognition and separation science.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
