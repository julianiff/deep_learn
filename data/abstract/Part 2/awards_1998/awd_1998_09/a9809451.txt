Phase III of this project is a collaborative,
              multidisciplinary extension of earlier work.  The PI's will combine isotope
              geochemistry with experimental petrology/geochemistry.  Objectives are to: 1)
              Continue to precisely measure the 186Os/188Os of a variety of possibly
              plume-derived rocks for which Pb-Os relations suggest the involvement of
              non-crustal 187Os-enriched materials, and assess if there is a positive
              relation between 186Os and 187Os enrichment.  2) Experimentally examine the
              partitioning of Pt, Re and Os between liquid and solid metal phases at
              increasingly higher pressures and temperatures.  The goal of this research is
              to assess whether the partitioning of Pt, Re and Os behave in larger planetary
              bodies as they do in asteroidal cores.  3) Precisely and accurately measure the
              concentrations of Pt and Pt/Os in a variety of mantle and crustal materials
              that may be recycled into the mantle.  The goal of this aspect of the research
              is to confirm or deny the preliminary evidence that suggests recycling of
              crustal materials into the mantle little affects the Pt/Os ratio of
              mantle-crust mixtures.
