Abstract    :
              The kinetics and products of the atmospherically important reactions of volatile
              non-methane organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from biogenic sources will be
              studied. Biogenic emissions of hydrocarbons, such as isoprene, monoterpenes,
              sesquiterpenes, and a variety of oxygenated species are estimated to dominate
              over those emitted from anthropogenic sources on global and regional scales.
              Hydrocarbons play an important role in the formation of ozone in rural and
              urban areas.
	Specifically, the products of the reactions of hydroxyl (OH)
              radical, in the presence and absence of NOx, nitrate (NO3) radicals, and ozone
              with isoprene, monoterpenes, and oxygenated VOCs will be studied. Kinetic,
              product, and mechanistic studies of first-generation  (and possibly
              second-generation) products of isoprene, monoterpenes, and oxygenated biogenic
              VOCs will be conducted. The resulting detailed data will be useful as inputs
              into chemical mechanisms for use in urban and regional-scale computer models
              for the formation of ozone and other photochemical oxidants.
