Abstract    :
              This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will
              use a new machine vision sensing system designed with laser backlighting
              techniques to capture the transfer of metal droplets from a Gas Metal Arc
              welding system to controlled deposition in a 3-D geometry. The knowledge gained
              from these experiments will provide a better understanding of the physics of
              the droplet formation and the deposition mechanisms. It is expected that a high
              speed image-processing algorithm will be developed to extract key geometrical
              information from within this high temperature, difficult environment.   The
              transfer of the metal droplets plays a fundamental role in determining the
              quality of the final product. Due to the strong coupling that exist among the
              welding parameters, the experimental work is designed in an attempt to isolate
              their effects upon the droplet formation and deposition. The new layered
              deposition method based upon this controlled droplet process has high potential
              for industrial applications, and industry commitment is demonstrated in this
              GOALI research project.
