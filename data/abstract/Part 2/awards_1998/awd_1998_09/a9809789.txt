Abstract    :
                This project extends the Principal Investigator's research on public health,
              civil and criminal law as they relate to the spread of infectious diseases. 
              The PI is using historical analysis  of the variation of epidemic disease
              prevention strategies to determine the factors that influence national
              approaches to AIDS.  The project has two goals.  First, to analyze the reasons
              for national variations in the legislation and regulation applied to AIDS and
              thereby to determine, by comparative analysis of several nations, what the
              crucial determining factors have been in the evolution and development of
              preventive strategies.  Second, it will evaluate the historical trajectory and
              tradition influencing legal structure and policy debates that appear otherwise
              to be concerned largely with contemporary issues.  Data are being collected in
              Germany, Britain, Sweden , and France.  The results will advance scientific
              understanding of the legal and procedural strategies to epidemics.
