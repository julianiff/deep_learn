Abstract    :
              9809388  Ford  The objective of this project is to understand how an extreme
              high temperature environment has influenced the survival mechanisms associated
              with the swimming behavior, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation of Thermatoga
              maritima.  The results of this project are to provide insight into the
              evolution of microorganisms exposed to extreme thermal environments. 
              Information from this project will complement the structure/function
              relationships of chemotaxis proteins being investigated at the molecular level
              by other researchers.  Understanding how microorganisms optimize their
              chemotactic response in extreme environments will be useful for technological
              advances in developing biosensors, bioremediation efforts, and oil recovery
              operations.  ***
