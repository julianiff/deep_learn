Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9809829  J. Brennecke/U. of Notre Dame    The purpose of the
              Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference is to bring
              together researchers in the areas of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
              in the midwest area for the exchange of ideas and most recent research results.
               It is particularly designed as a platform for young researchers (graduate
              students and young faculty members) to gain confidence and experience in
              presenting and discussing their ideas and research accomplishments.    The 1998
              Conference will be held May 18-19, 1998 at the University of Notre Dame.  The
              four sessions include:  Macromolecular Adsorption, Supercritical Fluids and
              Modeling and Theory.  The conference participants will come from the fields of
              chemical engineering, chemistry, material science and physics.   ***
