Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9809285  Lehman, Scott  University of Colorado  Title: Preparation
              and AMS 14C Dating of Terrestrial Materials for  the ESH Program    ESH Program
              research relies upon the availability of accurate AMS  14C dates in order to
              obtain the chronologic control necessary for  studies of natural climate
              variability on timescales of millennia  or less.  There is a compelling need
              for well-dated time series of  terrestrial paleo-environmental change, and such
              efforts are likely  to increase.  This research often involves specialized pre-
               treatment of samples to separate contaminating from primary sources  of
              carbon.  The Laboratory for AMS 14C Preparation and Research at  the University
              of Colorado (NSRL) and the National Ocean Sciences  Accelerator Mass
              Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) at the Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution
              will offer pre-treatment, graphitization,  and 14C measurement of terrestrial
              materials with an expected  average sample-receipt to date-report turnaround
              time of 8 weeks or  less.  It is anticipated that this service and hence the
              reduced  cost to the PI will help to motivate ESH-funded scientists to 
              undertake more extensive, and potentially more accurate 14C dating  of
              terrestrial paleo-climate and -environmental records.
