The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at Columbia University focuses on organic/inorganic materials, with an emphasis
              on materials chemistry.  The Center also provides seed funding for new
              opportunities in materials research.  The Center supports efforts in materials
              education at all levels, including summer undergraduate research experiences
              and research experiences for high school science teachers.  The MRSEC also
              supports shared experimental facilities that are accessible to center
              participants and to outside users, and has strong research collaborations with
              other universities and industrial laboratories in the New York City
              metropolitan area.

Research in the Columbia MRSEC is organized in an
              interdisciplinary research group that addresses the science of inorganic
              nanocrystal arrays within polymer or organic media. Participants in the Center
              currently include 12 senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral associates, 12
              graduate students, 16 undergraduates and 1 administrative support personnel. 
              Professor Irving P. Herman directs the MRSEC.
