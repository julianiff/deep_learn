Abstract    :
              EIA-9809224  Bailey, Michael  U. of California, San Diego    CARE:  A
              Network-Based Solid Freeform Fabrication Facility for Scientific Visualization 
                This award supports the Center for Visualization Prototypes, which uses  
              telemanufacturing techniques to provide Internet access to model-making  
              services.  The center provides wide access to 3D modeling for scientific  
              visualization, using hardware and software that has been in successful use  
              for several years.  The center is also enhancing these facilities, notably  
              through addition of a molding capability that can provide multiple copies   of
              3D models.  Scientific visualization datasets are constantly becoming   larger
              and more complex.  As data become more difficult to understand, new   and
              better ways of understanding it are needed.  The model-making   facilities at
              this center allow scientific visualization to incorporate   tactile and dynamic
              elements, which can provide new insights into   scientific and engineering
              problems.
