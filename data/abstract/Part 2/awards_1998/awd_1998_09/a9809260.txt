Abstract    :
              This GOALI award is to support a two-month collaborative  research effort of UPI
              at Barry Controls of Brighton, MA.  During the first four weeks of research,
              the PI will review  vibration isolation system control strategies; formulate 
              realistic controller and actuator  models; and carry out  robust stability
              analysis. The analysis will demonstrate the  utility of a new analysis
              technique developed by the PI to  solve a real world problem. During the next
              five weeks, the  research will focus on power and energy consumption of an 
              active vibration isolation system. Power requirements with a  variety of
              controllers for both conventional and  regenerative control strategy, it will
              be possible to  quantify required power versus the performance of the closed- 
              loop system, which is critical for system design. For the  regenerative control
              strategy, the product of actuator force  and actuator velocity, when
              positive--denotes the power  required by the vibration isolation system; and
              when  negative-denotes the power to be applied to the system,  i.e., power that
              could actually be regenerated. A major goal  of this research is to enhance an
              understanding of  regenerative control as applied to vibration isolation 
              systems.
