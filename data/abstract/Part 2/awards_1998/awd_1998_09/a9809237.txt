Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the governing narrative of the Cold War in
              order to understand how particular values and purposes came to dominate risk
              analysis.  It casts risk analysis's regulatory history in a new light by
              showing that it was not established in the late 1970's, as most accounts claim,
              but much earlier.  Case studies of civil defense planning, nuclear reactor
              safety,  and the controversy over nuclear fallout show a) that risk analysis
              emerged early in the Cold War to meet policy objectives similar to those
              characteristics of later risk analysis, and b) that changes in methodology and
              regulatory sites marked its reestablishment in the late 1970's.  This effort to
              reinstitute early Cold War patterns of authority and values in the wake of the
              social upheavals and regulatory reforms of the sixties marked a new and still
              unresolved phase in a conflict between system learning and social learning. 
              The study argues that current tensions between authoritarian and democratic
              approaches to regulatory risk are indicative of an underlying choice about
              alternative forms of modernization.
