Abstract    :
                A 200 MHZ Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer
              has been purchased for the improvement of the undergraduate chemistry
              laboratories. Students are introduced to FT-NMR  in General Chemistry, where
              not only chemistry majors, but biology, physics and environmental science
              majors have a chance to use it. Each year as the students move through the
              chemistry curriculum they build on the previous experience, so that by the time
              they are seniors they are as familiar with the NMR as they are with other
              instrumentation. While some of the undergraduate courses already include theory
              and spectral interpretation of basic 1- and more sophisticated 2-D NMR
              experiments for analyses of chemical structures, the hands-on experience gives
              the students a greater appreciation for what the instrument can do in
              elucidating structures and identifying compounds. This  low-maintenance,
              versatile, fast, and easy-to-use FT-NMR spectrometer with related computer
              support is ideally suited for use by students in laboratory courses throughout
              the chemistry curriculum.
