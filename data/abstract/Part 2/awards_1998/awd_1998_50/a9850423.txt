Abstract    :
                Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is central to most strategies for
              solving structural problems and gathering thermodynamic and kinetic data in
              chemistry. The 60 MHz NMR spectrometer currently in use is the weak link in the
              Department of Chemistry's efforts to design and execute unique discovery-based
              activities in the laboratory. Thus, Lycoming College requests matching funds
              for the acquisition of a multinuclear Bruker Avance 250 MHz NMR spectrometer.
              Acquisition of the spectrometer will allow for the incorporation of multiweek
              investigational experiments which exploit NMR (as well as other complimentary
              spectroscopic techniques) in both core courses (Organic chemistry I and II,
              Inorganic Chemistry, and Physical Chemistry I and II) and advanced elective
              courses (Spectroscopy and Molecular Structure and Organometallic Chemistry). A
              modern NMR spectrometer will also significantly enhance the undergraduate
              research program the department offers within the context of both Independent
              Studies projects and the summer research experience.
