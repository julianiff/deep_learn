Abstract    :
              American companies today must compete in a global marketplace.  To be
              competitive, these same companies must have a workplace that functions at high
              performance levels.  The maintenance function is the key to survival in a high
              performance workplace.  Each company must employ maintenance technicians who
              must develop, retain, and continuously enhance increasingly complex
              multifunctional skills to perform in an industrial high performance workplace
              environment.  Maintenance engineering technicians are unique in that they must
              acquire and use basic skills and knowledge, occupation-specific skills,
              multi-trade skills, and cross-functional skills to keep up with the changing
              demands of the American workplace.  The field of maintenance engineering
              technology encompasses all of the industry and represents the lifeblood of
              building and plant facility's operations and operations in production and
              process industries.  The Maintenance Engineering Technology Program (METPRO) at
              Henry Ford Community College (HFCC) links education, government, business and
              industry to consolidate the resources necessary to prepare persons to enter,
              upgrade or enhance their position in the maintenance engineering technology
              field as high performance multifunctional maintenance engineering technicians
              (HP-METEC) with the following: 1) Development and implementation of a national
              standard and certification system and a maintenance engineering technology
              curricula at the secondary school and community college levels and articulating
              these programs with related university programs, 2) ensure basic math, science,
              communications and SCANS considerations are addressed in maintenance
              engineering technology programs, 3) provide enhanced vision of the maintenance
              engineering technology field for high school teachers, college and university
              faculty, 4) provide direct links through partnerships with business and
              industry to ensure workplace experiences and competencies are part maintenance
              engineering technology curricula to allow smooth  transition of graduates into
              the workplace and, 5) address the upgrade training needs of experienced workers
              with ease of access to METPRO courses and its certification system.
