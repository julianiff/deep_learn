Abstract    :
              This project entails the development of a geographic information systems (GIS)
              laboratory with at least 8 personal computers, a dedicated server, and 1
              graphics workstation. This laboratory will be used to teach undergraduate
              students the principles of geographic analysis, computer cartography, remote
              sensing, and geographic information systems as well as provide hands-on
              experience in research methods in the social and natural sciences.     At
              present, faculty teach courses in GIS, computer cartography, and remote sensing
              using personal computers in laboratories shared with the rest of the University
              community.  The requested equipment is necessary to efficiently run state of
              the art GIS software currently available across the University, and to support
              and efficiently manage improved instruction in a newly revised Geography
              curriculum.      A dedicated GIS laboratory will be established within the
              Department of Geography.  It will offer opportunities to students in a variety
              of human and natural science disciplines across the campus.  This project will
              also allow the enhancement of faculty and undergraduate research at DePaul, and
              will contribute to the University's missions of public service to a diverse
              urban community.
