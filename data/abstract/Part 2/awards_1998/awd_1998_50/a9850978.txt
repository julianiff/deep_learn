Abstract    :
                This project involves the acquisition of a hardware/software upgrade to our
              current 60 Mhz continuous wave NMR spectrometer that will allow it to function
              as a multinuclear, FT instrument. We seek to have the largest number of science
              students possible get hands-on exposure to a wide variety of modern
              instrumental techniques in chemistry. The relatively short spectrum acquisition
              time, coupled with off-line data reduction and analysis, will allow all science
              majors at Wittenberg to get experience using this modern spectroscopic
              technique. Further, in a wide range of courses in the Chemistry curriculum,
              chemistry majors will utilize this technique as a ubiquitous probe of static
              and dynamic molecular structure. The sequential nature of the early part of the
              curriculum allows the students to be introduced to various aspects of the
              FT-NMR experiment in a layered fashion, where each topic builds upon prior
              knowledge and skills. Experiments will include the use of FT-NMR as an indirect
              probe of magnetism and electronegativity in general chemistry, structure
              analysis by 1H and 13C NMR spectra in organic chemistry,  quantitative analysis
              in analytical chemistry, kinetics analysis and relaxation time studies in
              physical chemistry, structure in biochemistry using 1H and 31p spectra, and
              static and dynamic analysis in inorganic chemistry using 1H, 13C, 31p, and 11B
              spectra.
