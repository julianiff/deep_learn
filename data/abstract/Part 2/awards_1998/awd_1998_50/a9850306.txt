Abstract    :
                Interest in Geographic Information Science (GIS) advanced technology education
              has broadened to the point where exciting, innovative applications are being
              developed at many levels in schools and colleges. However, the broad
              applications of GIS and the rapid growth of the field have led to a lack of
              coordination and awareness among practitioners and educators.     Cypress
              College, a two-year, state funded community college, is providing GIS training
              to high school teachers, and community college and university faculty in five
              locations. These workshops are providing technical upgrading, facilitating
              communication, collaboration and cooperation, promoting creative teaching and
              fostering effective learning environments.      The two-year sequence of Summer
              Institutes, with sites around the nation, serves 120 faculty selected to
              develop their teaching skills and technological competencies.
