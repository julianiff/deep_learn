Abstract    :
                We propose to enhance the utility of "Amusement Park Physics" events for
              physics instruction by collecting high resolution inertial data from a large
              variery of popular and interesting rides using a data acquisition system with
              sensors for three axes each of acceleration and rotation.  The data will be
              processed and displayed by multimedia software to be written in Java to allow
              cross-platform and intenet usage. The displays will include an animated
              re-creation of the ride with vector diagiams attached to the moving cart, bar
              graphs showing scalar quantities such as potential and kinetic energy, and a
              synchronized video display.  The program and data will be published on CD ROM
              with accompanying printed supplementary text.  Also smaller related applets
              will be made available at the Porterville College web site.  Access to the
              detailed inertial data for real roller coasters makes many physical phenomena
              accessible to investigation that would otherwise be subject to little more than
              speculation. This powerful tool allows classes to return from an amusement park
              event and continue the discovery process over the following weeks.  During the
              initial phases, the program and data will be tested and evaluated in the
              physics, physical science, and calculus classes at Porterville College and in
              classes at the two local high schools.
