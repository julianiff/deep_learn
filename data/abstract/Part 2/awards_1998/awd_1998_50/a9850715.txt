Abstract    :
              This request is for funding to purchase data acquisition/analysis hardware to
              equip a new physiology laboratory course. This initiative is part of an overall
              renovation of the physiology curriculum. Currently, only one core physiology
              course has a laboratory component (Mammalian Physiology).  We will eliminate
              the lab portion of that course and create a new investigative laboratory
              experience the Integrated physiology Laboratory (IPL), that will service all of
              the physiology lecture courses. This laboratory course will be based in the
              Student Physiology Analysis and Research Center (SPARC).  The course will be
              comparative in nature, contrasting physiological adaptations to common problems
              across taxonomic and organizational levels. Model systems will include plants,
              vertebrates invertebrates, prokayotes and fungi.  We will explore a11 levels of
              complexity from the cellular to the organismal.  Our approach gives the
              students a unique opportunity to see the common problems of all living systems
              and their diverse ways of handling those problems.  The cost effectiveness and
              the pedagogical desirability of this plan justify a compete renovation of our
              current physiology program.
