Abstract    :
                This project is providing biology majors, including those preparing to be
              teachers, with sophisticated training in protein purification, enzymology,
              monoclonal antibody development, cellular activation strategies, and mammalian
              cell culture techniques.  The  equipment facilitates major improvements in both
              Biochemistry and Immunology.   The affected courses utilize a research
              approach.   Students design experiments, generate, record, analyze, and
              disseminate scientific data from their own research.  Other undergraduate
              courses benefiting from these improvements include: microbiology, cell biology,
              molecular biology, nutritional biochemistry, analytical chemistry,
              environmental chemistry, and instrumental analysis.  The equipment also helps
              to enhance undergraduate research projects and a science camp for talented high
              school students.
