Abstract    :
                The acquisition of a state-of-the-art isothermal titration microcalorimeter
              (ITC) will greatly enhance instruction in a number of classes by providing the
              students with the opportunity to experimentally determine a complete
              thermodynamic profile for the system under investigation in one experiment.
              Specifically, the ITC will provide the capability to: teach solution
              thermodynamics in the physical chemistry and biochemistry courses in a more
              meaningful way; perform exciting and relevant experiments in the laboratory
              programs of a number of courses; and develop undergraduate research projects
              which require the use of an solution microcalorimeter. A number of new
              experiments are proposed for courses ranging from physical chemistry to
              biochemistry. These include: the interaction of ribonuclease and ribonuclease
              derivatives with the substrate analogue CMP; the binding of carbohydrates to
              lectins; the interaction of metal ions with tetracycline; the determination of
              the Km for ?-galactosidase and the KI a number of inhibitors of
              (-galactosidase; and the binding of cyanide and azide to metmyoglobin. The use
              of the ITC will expose undergraduate students to these important areas of
              chemistry and biochemistry which is not possible to do effectively with the
              present equipment.
