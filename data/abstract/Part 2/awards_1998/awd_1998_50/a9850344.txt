Abstract    :
                Houston Community College System is producing an instructor's guide and a
              package of GIS/GPS laboratory exercises using workplace data sets for the PC
              environment. These interactive laboratory exercises may be accessed on the HCCS
              World Wide Web site <http://www.hccs.cc.tx.us> and also on CD-ROM. Project
              materials incorporate interactive features with workplace data sets and
              objectives into the laboratory exercises. The laboratory exercises enhance
              available instructional resources based upon currently available curriculum
              guidelines. Six collaborating community colleges in six states have agreed to
              test the interactive exercises prior to the final external evaluation. After
              field testing, the CD-ROMs will be available for use by community colleges and
              four-year institutions.
