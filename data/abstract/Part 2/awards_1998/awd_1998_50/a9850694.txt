Abstract    :
               Equipment for updating the established Cell Culture Facility and for
              introducing molecular techniques into the Virology and Microbiology curriculum
              is allowing: (a) an extensive modification of Virology, a required course in
              the microbiology major, to include better coverage of animal viruses and the
              molecular techniques;  (b) the introduction of new experiments into Immunology,
              Medical Bacteriology, and Microbial Survey; and (c) the offering of
              undergraduate research options related to cell culture, animal viruses, and
              molecular applications towards animal viruses, which also support student
              research topics.
