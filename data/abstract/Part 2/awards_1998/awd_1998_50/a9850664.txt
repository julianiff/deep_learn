Abstract    :
                We are requesting $100,000 of NSF ILI support for LIVE:  The Laboratory for
              Visual Environments at the University of Pennsylvania.  With the requested NSF
              ILI support and School of Engineering and Applied Science matching funds, we
              would purchase 24 OpenGL Windows NT systems and networking infrastructure to
              support undergraduate teaching and projects in computer graphics, visual and
              virtual environments, and high speed multi-computer networking.  Direct
              manipulation and programming of these concepts is the ideal setting for
              teaching and learning about complex phenomena.  LIVE will upgrade an aging SGI
              facility, serve Computer and Information Science curriculum needs, and enhance
              the computer science aspects of a new undergraduate program in Digital Media
              Technology spanning the Engineering, Fine Arts, and Communications Schools at
              the University of Pennsylvania.
