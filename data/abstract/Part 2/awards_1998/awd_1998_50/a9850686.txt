Abstract    :
                Hofstra University proposes to enhance the science education of non-majors,
              and especially prospective K-12 teachers by constructing a dedicated Teaching
              Laboratory for the Departments of Mathematics and Physics (which includes
              Astronomy). The laboratory will serve 820 students enrolled annually in the
              courses "Mathematical Excursions" and "Explorations in Mathematics" (MATH 12
              and 16), 625 students enrolled annually in the courses "The Solar System" and
              "Stars and Galaxies" (ASTR 11 and 12) and an anticipated 120 students enrolled
              annually in a new course "Models and Algorithms" (MATH 13, provisional title)
              to be developed with support from this project. The major thrust of this
              proposal is to involve students actively in learning major concepts and
              methodologies of both mathematics and astronomy: the processes of observation,
              discovery, description (as rules or algorithms) and verification. Some topics
              will be studied in both mathematics and astronomy; in which case the treatment
              in each course will be self-contained, but connections between the disciplines
              will also be explored. The proposed Teaching Laboratory will include 18
              networked high-end PC's together with an instructor station, projector and
              printers serving instructional needs in all of the affected courses and
              PC-based CCD cameras to be attached to existing telescopes to facilitate
              gathering data for later analysis in Astronomy 11 and 12. The proposed Teaching
              Laboratory will complement several existing open-access laboratories located
              throughout Hofstra's campus. This project is expected to improve instruction
              both locally and nationally, the latter through dissemination of class
              materials and results via professional meetings and journals, as well as
              courseware on Hofstra University's world wide web site.
