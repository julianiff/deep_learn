Abstract    :
              Lexington Community College in collaboration with other colleges in the
              University of Kentucky Community College System leads this project to develop
              an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) Degree in Network Systems Administration.
              The group is also collaborating with high schools, regional universities,
              businesses and industries in Kentucky, and other telecommunications and network
              systems degree programs being developed around the country. The project
              modernizes and upgrades the core science and mathematics courses required for
              the degree. It develops the degree-specific courses from a combination of (1)
              existing courses in science, mathematics, engineering technology and computer
              information systems, (2) new courses, and (3) hybrids of engineering technology
              and computer information system courses. The courses specific to the program
              are modularized to ensure flexibility and ease of revision to maintain
              currency. The program targets both traditional and nontraditional students,
              targets students from underrepresented groups, and  recruits students from the
              Student Technology Leadership Program and Tech Prep programs. It uses a
              combination of traditional delivery systems and distance learning via the
              Internet and interactive video, and it includes student internships and co-ops
              with local businesses and industries. The program is to be offered statewide
              and disseminated nationwide.
