Abstract    :
                The Design and Rapid Prototyping Instrumentation Project for Technology
              Teacher Education at Ball State University puts high-tech design equipment in
              the hands of tomorrow's technology teachers. As technology education evolves
              from industrial arts, there is an increasing emphasis on teaching secondary
              school students about technological design. Unfortunately, technology students
              and teachers often have experiences only with outdated and inefficient hardware
              and software design tools. The objective of this project is to give
              undergraduates in technology education experiences with advanced tools for
              technological design. These teachers of tomorrow will then be better equipped
              to help their students achieve in this area. Undergraduates in Ball State's
              Technology Teacher Education Program have added experiences from this project
              in both two- and three-dimensional design at two different stations. At Station
              1, they input an existing design with a page scanner, from a file, or using
              design or drafting software. The design is then manipulated as needed. One of
              the output devices at this station is a laser cutting machine, where students
              cut out these designs from appropriate materials, such as 1/4-inch acrylic and
              wood. At a Station 2, the students use a three-dimensional laser scanner to
              input the surface coordinates of existing objects. They then manipulate this
              design data to suit the needs of their project. The output can be an
              illustration, or files that could be used with an existing numerically
              controlled milling machine or an existing fused deposition modeling machine to
              create a prototype.
