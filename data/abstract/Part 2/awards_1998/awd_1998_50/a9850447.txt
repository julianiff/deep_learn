Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to equip a Neurohistology laboratory for the
              Psychology department of Alma College. This would enable us to increase the
              number of undergraduates we can include in this program, and the variety of
              procedures taught. The project involves adding a new course in Neurohistology
              as well as adding exercises to existing courses and equipment-related
              opportunities to our independent study projects.     The new course would
              include several exercises designed to teach techniques by examining structure
              and activity of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. Exercises would cover
              axon degeneration, tract tracing, immunocytochemical labeling of neuropeptides
              and light and electron microscopic examination and photography.
