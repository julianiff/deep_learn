Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department at Western Kentucky University is implementing a new,
              interdisciplinary laboratory course for its senior undergraduate chemistry
              majors. Several new experiments are proposed, many of which require use of a
              modern FT-NMR spectrometer.  These experiments enhance laboratory skills and
              critical thinking with regard to: (1) stereochemical concepts, (2) chemical
              dynamics, (3) structure determination, (4) synthetic methodologies, and (5)
              molecular modeling.    The upgraded FT-NMR plays a vital role in these
              experiments. Development of these experiments involves four faculty and between
              ten and twenty undergraduate students over the two year period of the grant. 
              The goal of this project is to implement a new, interdisciplinary advanced
              laboratory course for senior chemistry majors. Other existing courses benefit
              through modernization of the FT NMR spectrometer.  A significant filter-down
              effect of lab experiments and student expertise (as lab TA's) also enhances the
              lower-level courses.
