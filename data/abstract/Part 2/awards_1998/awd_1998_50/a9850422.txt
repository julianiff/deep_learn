Abstract    :
                This project is focused on developing an undergraduate magnetic materials
              laboratory. This lab will be structured to emphasize microstructure/properties
              relationships in magnetic systems of current interest and to train students in
              areas related to our recently funded MURI research proposal. Transmission
              electron microscopy will be surveyed by laboratory demonstration and by
              computer simulation. The laboratory equipment will impact on the ability to
              characterize the microstructure of state of the art magnetic materials. The
              Principal Investigator is experienced in the areas of microstructural
              characterization and development of structure properties relationships as
              applied to magnetic materials systems.
