Abstract    :
                The Department of Psychology at Clark University is establishing an
              undergraduate laboratory network in support of the teaching of observational
              and experimental methods in psychology through hands-on experience. For more
              than half of the Department's major students, the high point of their
              curriculum is participation in the Department's Research Course Program.    
              The Research Course Program is a system of courses in which advanced
              undergraduate students work closely with faculty and graduate students in
              faculty laboratories. Their work usually culminates in a presentation at a
              local, regional, or national research conference. This project provides three
              undergraduate laboratories.      It provides equipment for faculty research
              settings that are specifically dedicated to undergraduate use.       It will
              also outfit a "research skills room" where sophomores preparing for research
              experiences may simulate experimental and statistical decision making and
              practice observational techniques.      Finally, it provides and equips a
              "Poster/Presentation Room," where research course students can prepare poster
              and pamphlet presentations.
