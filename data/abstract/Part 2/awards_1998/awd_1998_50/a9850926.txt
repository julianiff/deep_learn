Abstract    :
                The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Denison University will
              enhance instruction and research utilizing NMR by upgrading the obsolete data
              system of its Bruker AC300 spectrometer to a modern Power Mac based system.
              This will replace a proprietary key stroke oriented user interface with a
              standard graphical interface identical to that used for offline data
              processing. The improved data interface will lead to greater and more
              sophisticated use of NMR spectroscopy throughout the chemistry curriculum, in
              turn leading to deepened student learning of a central analytic technique and
              greater development of student abilities to solve complex and diverse problems.
              Our experience will be shared at a workshop for chemistry faculty and other
              public forms.
