Abstract    :
              Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD, is creating an institution-wide
              reform of courses and curricula with the goal of increasing our students'
              technological literacy and skills and their understanding of the
              interdisciplinary nature of the natural sciences, mathematics, social sciences,
              and technologies.

Under the leadership of the college's Vice President for
              Instruction who is serving as the project director, six faculty members have
              been selected to serve as the Alpha Team to design the first set of modules for
              their respective disciplines. These modules utilize technology, have
              interdisciplinary character, and are capable of spawning other curriculum
              products across the college. In Year II, faculty members are competing to
              become members of the college's Beta Team which adapt, adopt, and refine the
              modules and the related technologies that have been developed by Alpha Team
              members. The college is providing release time for these Beta Team members. The
              college then continues to provide release time for additional faculty who are
              competing to develop technology-rich, interdisciplinary modules in Years III
              and IV.

During Year I, over 3,000 students/semester are being impacted by
              these technology-rich modules. It is envisioned that, through the use of
              release time from the college, these curricular innovations are reaching over
              7,000 students per semester by the end of Year IV.

To prepare for this
              curriculum reform, the college has strengthened its technology professional
              development program for faculty and enhanced its infrastructure through
              addition of more hardware, software, technical staff, and additional computer
              classrooms and laboratories.
