Abstract    :
              Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies, in partnership with five consortia
              of community colleges across the nation, have established a nationwide effort
              to equip faculty with the tools they need to teach generic manufacturing
              workplace  competencies to community college students.  The outcome has been
              the development of five CD-ROM modules based on the SCANS competencies.  The
              second phase of this project will bring the now-tested concept to reality in a
              self-sustaining manner through extensive faculty development, assessment, and
              extension and enhancement of the CD-ROMs.  The model of  technician education
              being used to guide the project is Integrated (or blended), Project-based,
              Collaborative, Assessment-guided, and Technology-intensive.  While ATE has been
              funding models of technician training with some or all of these
              characteristics, and these models have begun to change community college
              teaching  in selected institutions, four challenges remain: (1) Refine the
              models; (2) Institutionalize the  models so that the changes are sustained; (3)
              Build an expanding network of  colleges that will use the results of not only
              this project but of ATE's other successful projects as well; and (4) Connect
              the network to high schools (via Tech Prep), other colleges and employers.
