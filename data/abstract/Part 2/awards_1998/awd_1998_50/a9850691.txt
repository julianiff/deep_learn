Abstract    :
                This project is enabling the department to build a strong program in genetics
              - one that incorporates modern theory and methods.  Hands on investigative
              laboratories are being designed and offered to first and second year biology
              majors; many of whom are planning to be teachers. Laboratory exercises include
              computer simulations of Mendelian crosses of peas and Drosophila, sex-linkage
              and mapping through 3-factor linkage analysis and chi-square tests, cytological
              preparation and microscopic examination of giant salivary chromosomes. 
              Identification of chromosomal mutations and haploid linkage analysis complete
              the transmission genetics labs. Students also isolate DNA, transform bacteria
              with plasmids, use restriction enzymes to construct standard curves, map
              restriction sites, probe Southern blots, amplify human DNA using the polymerase
              chain reaction, sequence DNA, align DNA sequences on computer, and apply
              allozyme electrophoresis to a problem in population genetics.
