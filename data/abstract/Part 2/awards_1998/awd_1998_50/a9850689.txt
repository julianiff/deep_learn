Abstract    :
               The project equips introductory and advanced biology laboratories with the
              instrumentation necessary to conduct experiments in molecular biology,
              microbiology, and modern genetics.  Experience in DNA isolation, genetic
              testing, gene cloning, PCR, nucleic acid hybridization, phage genetics, and E.
              coli culturing and transformation enables students to understand molecular
              biology and biotechnology from a practical perspective. A number of laboratory
              exercises include Internet research. The revised laboratories impact not only
              all biology majors but also non-majors who elect to take biology to fulfill a
              laboratory science requirement. The educational goals of the project are four
              fold: 1) to improve scientific literacy in non- and biology majors; 2) to
              attract education and other majors to investigating additional laboratory
              courses in biology; 3) to attract and improve the retention rates of those
              students traditionally underrepresented in the sciences; and 4) to provide
              biology majors with the academic and technical background required for
              successful transfer to four year schools or for employment as technicians. The
              laboratory exercises are designed to encourage critical thinking and to provide
              hands-on experience within the framework of a small team. Modules are
              integrated so that concepts and practices learned in introductory laboratories
              are reinforced in advanced laboratories. In addition, students at the branch
              campus (located in downtown Trenton) engage in laboratories that emphasize
              experimentation, rather than observation of computer simulations.
