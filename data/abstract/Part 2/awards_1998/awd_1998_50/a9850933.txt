Abstract    :
              This project is developing a laboratory to support electronic communications.
              Rapid growth in the telecommunications equipment and software/network
              integration industrial segments suggests that there is a dramatic increase in
              the demand for workers knowledgeable in concepts such as fiber optics and
              networking, experienced with the architecture found in modern communications
              hardware, and familiar with electronics simulation software.   Reallocation of
              existing computers to the first year electronics lab is supporting experiments
              using simulation software.  The computer repair test laboratory is supporting
              experiments in copper and fiber optic networking. In conjunction with the lab
              improvements, new lecture materials are being introduced to supplement the
              students' understanding of wireless communications topics, such as radio,
              satellite, cable, and cell phone operations.  The improvement project will
              produce students significantly better prepared to pursue careers in the rapidly
              growing telecommunications industry, and/or continue their studies at the
              four-year college and university level.
