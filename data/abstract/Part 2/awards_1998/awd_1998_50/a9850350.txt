Abstract    :
                This is a project to enable a core of high school teachers currently engaged
              in the delivery of technical education to enhance classroom instruction based
              on cutting-edge technology. During Phase I planning and pilot work for the
              professional development will be done. The professional development has four
              components: 1.) teacher inservice through formal graduate course work; 2.)
              industrial work site experiences with emerging technologies; 3.) dissemination
              that uses electronic networking; and 4.) improvement of equity and diversity in
              the future workforce. The initial dissemination will be through several high
              schools, all part of the Heart of Ohio Tech Prep Consortium. The long range
              goal is to recruit teams of four teachers from the Consortium high schools. The
              ideal team would include a science teacher, a mathematics teacher, a
              communications skills teacher, and a technical education teacher. Work site
              experiences will be bracketed with active-learning, project-based college
              courses and other workshops.
