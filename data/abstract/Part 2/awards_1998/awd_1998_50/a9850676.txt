Abstract    :
                A laboratory course in semiconductor device processing and characterization is
              proposed which will form a key element of a new curriculum in Applied Physics
              being developed by the Physics Department at the University of Oregon. Funds
              are requested from the NSF-ILI program in order to develop this laboratory. The
              goal of the new curriculum is to better prepare physics majors and majors in
              allied fields such as chemistry for constructive participation in an industrial
              internship program, and ultimately for productive careers in the semiconductor
              manufacturing industry. The laboratory course constitutes an essential
              component of the new program and will expose physics and chemistry majors to
              technologically important issues in an area not traditionally covered in
              undergraduate physics or chemistry curricula.
