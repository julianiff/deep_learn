Abstract    :
              The biology faculty at Mount Mary College is introducing problem based learning
              into their curriculum. Specifically, targeted courses include Introductory
              Biology  lower level , Human Physiology  intermediate level  and Microbiology
              and Genetics  upper level . In each course, students collaborate in small teams
              to study real-world problem scenarios, which guide them to performing hands-on
              laboratory investigations that introduce them to modern biotechnology.  The
              result of this student-centered, faculty-facilitated instructional strategy is
              that women students, at multiple points in the undergraduate curriculum,
              develop problem-solving skills that pertain to the real world and are guided
              towards methods of scientific inquiry and critical analysis, thereby preparing
              them for careers in science and research while developing their proficiency and
              critical understanding of biotechnology.
