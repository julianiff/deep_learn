Abstract    :
                  This is a proposal to deliver Electronics and Computer Engineering
              Technology (ECET) to Maui Community College outreach students on Moloka i, Lana
              i, and Hana. This fifth year of the project focuses on the delivery and
              evaluation of the distance learning delivery system for the ECET curriculum to
              MCC s three satellite campuses. Development of multimedia modules will
              continue. In addition there will be development of practical on-line projects
              that illustrate electronics and computing principles. this will include the
              assembly of a weather station and implementation of student-designed software.
              A workshop on development of self-paced laboratory courses will be offered for
              Maui County science and mathematics teachers in March of 1998.      NSF FORM
