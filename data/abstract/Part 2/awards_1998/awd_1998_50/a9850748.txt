Abstract    :
              The vast potential of the World Wide Web and internet for providing students,
              specifically enrolled in introductory physics labs and astronomy, with new,
              exciting, and improved educational experiences has not yet been fully
              exploited. In this project, introductory physics laboratory stations are
              equipped with networked Pentium computers which will make innovative use of the
              capabilities of the internet and Windows 95 for the purpose of improving
              instruction. There are four major objectives: (1) to develop new experiments
              and measurement methods which utilize the power of computer based acquisition;
              (2) to institute a new mode of introductory lab instruction which emphasizes
              true application of the scientific method in carrying out lab exercises rather
              than merely following a recipe suggested by a standard lab manual; 3) to
              develop an enterprising method for preparation and submission of lab reports
              which will expose students to modern multimedia technology and electronic
              publishing; and (4) to create an astronomy lab which will augment the astronomy
              course by providing students with hands-on educational experiences and exciting
              computer based activities.
