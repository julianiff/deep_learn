Abstract    :
              A Finnigan GCQ Plus series GC/MS-MS/DS system, with DIP probe, NIST library
              function and HP LaserJet IV printer is finding extensive use in General
              Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis and Environmental
              Chemistry. In addition, the instrument is utilized in undergraduate research
              being conducted under the direction of the principle and co-principle
              investigators.  Use of this instrument enables our students to study the GC-MS
              technique itself in terms of the instrumental aspects, chemistry that occurs in
              the process of analyzing compounds, and usefulness of the technique in areas of
              industrial and environmental concern as a stand alone instrument. Future plans
              for the department include the use of our computer network and the acquisition
              of a server with terminals to organize and manage data. Because this GC-MS
              instrument is controlled by a powerful 133 Mhz Pentium(R) computer system, it
              can easily be integrated into our overall plan and represents the last major
              piece of instrumentation in our data networking plan.
