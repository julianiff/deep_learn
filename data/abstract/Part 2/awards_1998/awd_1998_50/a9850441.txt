Abstract    :
              A new Molecular Biotechnology course will be offered beginning the January
              lnterterm of 1999. "Hands on" work with techniques will enhance student
              understanding of their uses as well as stimulate student interest in science.
              The course is an attempt to enhance exposure of biology majors to this
              relatively new and actively growing field. The course immerses students in
              daily laboratories and lectures over a one month period and will provide an
              opportunity for the students to become intimate with modern techniques as well
              as experimental design. The experiments involve the cloning of the URA3 gene
              from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The students will subclone the gene
              after extensive restriction analysis. The gene will also be analyzed using PCR,
              Southern analysis and DNA sequencing. The instrumentation requested is a
              critical component of this course and will also be used for new laboratories in
              General Biology, Life Science, Microbiology as well as demonstrations in Cell
              biology. Our institution contains a significant number of Hispanics and first
              generation students. More than half of the student body is female. This course
              will provide students the opportunity to explore biotechnology as a career
              choice and will give them the background to become excited about post-graduate
              possibilities in molecular biological studies.
