Abstract    :
              The project involves the development of an upper-division laboratory course on
              computer- interfacing. The purpose of the course is to teach students the
              elementary aspects of automating experiments using a personal computer (PC).
              During the course, students use a PC to control the temperature of the bottom
              plate of a convection cell and to monitor the heat flux through the cell. The
              transition from the conduction to the convection state will be determined by
              this heat flux measurement. Throughout the course, students learn about a
              Windows NT operating system, a C/C++ programming language, and an analog to
              digital and digital to analog converter. Supplementary materials on Labview (a
              popular programming language for computer interfacing) and GPIB (a popular
              instrument interface standard) are being incorporated into the course.
