Abstract    :
                This is a project to develop a regional approach to the preparation and
              training of engineering technicians. These include technicians for the
              engineering technology fields of robotics, computer servicing and networking,
              manufacturing, and electronic technologies. The two/three year program begins
              with a common core curriculum in engineering technology at the seven community
              colleges which comprise the CREATE consortium. Each campus will then offer at
              least one of ten advanced technological specialties. Students from any one of
              the participating colleges will be able to transfer to any other college in the
              Consortium. In Phase I planning and pilot work will be done.
