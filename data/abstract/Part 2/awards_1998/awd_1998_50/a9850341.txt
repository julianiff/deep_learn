Abstract    :
              9850341  Chan    East Los Angeles College (ELAC), a California community
              college--in partnership with California State University, Los Angeles (CSLA), a
              comprehensive public university; two public high schools, Wilson High School
              and Roosevelt High School; four bioscience companies; and the Southern
              California Biomedical Council (an association of bioscience companies)--has
              created the Los Angeles Bioscience Project (LAB-Pro) to achieve two
              complementary and much-needed goals:  to help provide direction and career
              opportunities for minority community college students, many of whom never
              complete their studies, and to help meet the employment needs of the booming
              bioscience industry, which has more openings than it can fill with qualified
              personnel.    LAB-Pro has been designed as a multifaceted program that is
              achieving its goals in three primary ways. First, it is preparing high school
              and community college students for technical careers in bioscience by exposing
              them to career opportunities in the field and giving them the skills and
              practical experience needed to succeed in a highly demanded career. In
              addition, it is enhancing the knowledge of high school science teachers and
              community college instructors in bioscience. Finally, it is establishing a
              pipeline of qualified bioscience technicians, primarily from underrepresented
              minority groups, to fill the numerous jobs available within the growing
              bioscience field in Southern California.   The eighteen month project directly
              impacts a minimum of 20 community college students and 24 senior high school
              students, and indirectly impact many more.  ***
