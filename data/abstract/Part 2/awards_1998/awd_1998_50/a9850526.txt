Abstract    :
                This proposal describes a new approach to teaching the principles of cellular
              metabolism to introductory biology students in the laboratory setting. It
              involves the use of Vernier probe systems and notebook computers to allow
              real-time data acquisition and analysis. The objective of this project is to
              move away from "cookbook" lab exercises and directly involve students in both
              experimental design and data collection. We feel that this approach will
              increase student participation in and enjoyment of lab sessions and we predict
              improvement in the students' understanding of metabolism as measured by
              departmental examinations. We also hope to increase student retention in
              introductory courses and to improve the students' chances of success in the
              more advanced courses offered by the department. In the proposed laboratory
              sessions students will design and carry out experiments to answer questions
              related to enzyme function, cellular respiration, fermentation and
              photosynthesis. They will be required to make use of the scientific method and
              to explain their experimental design and results to others through in-class
              presentations, thus giving the students an active role in learning these
              difficult concepts.
