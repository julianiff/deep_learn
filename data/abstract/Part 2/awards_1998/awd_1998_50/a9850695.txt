Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to add pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              experiments to the experimental physics course and to develop the experiments.
              Modular components used which are incorporated into a working NMR system with
              which students can learn to measure nuclear relaxation times, use Fourier
              transforms in NMR measurements, use quadrature detection techniques and use
              multiple pulse sequences to remove dipolar broadening in solid samples.
              Students who work with these experiments gain understanding of many aspects of
              physics involved in NMR, including slow molecular motions in solids, negative
              absolute temperature in discrete level spin systems, and many of the basic
              ideas upon which the very important and widely useful technique  -- magnetic
              resonance imaging (MRI) -- has been developed. Resulting experiments will be
              shared through presentations or publications.
