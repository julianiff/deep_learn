Abstract    :
              The proposed biotechnology program consists of 3 semesters of sequential core
              courses, which when combined with the appropriate general education courses may
              earn an AS degree in Biotechnology. The program was developed along NSE
              recommendations, will operate with Tech Prep programs in local high schools and
              culminate with required internships at industrial locations. Articulation of
              the core courses with 4-year colleges and universities will provide students
              with additional degree and/or career options. Valuable input and direction were
              received from individuals in successful biotechnology programs at other
              California community colleges, the Southern and Central California
              Biotechnology Centers, several transfer institutions and local industries. The
              program involves cooperative teaching by chemistry, agriculture and biology
              faculty. Collectively, these departments serve more than 1,300 students
              annually who might benefit from the biotechnology program.  The Science and
              Engineering facilities are scheduled for safety upgrade renovations to begin in
              January, 1998, and plans include converting one laboratory for biotechnology.
              However, without external finding the start of the program will be delayed. The
              equipment needs for such a program include  electrophoresis, thermocycler,
              rotary shaker(s), micropipets, refrigerated micro-centrifuge. Funding of this
              project will provide students with increased hands-on learning meaningful to
              transfer requirements, more diversified student choices beyond the impacted
              allied health programs now available, and comprehensive problem-solving
              activities in traditional courses.
