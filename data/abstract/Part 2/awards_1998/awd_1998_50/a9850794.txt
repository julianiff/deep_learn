Abstract    :
              It is proposed to build a CCD camera and guider for the 0.6 m (Perkin) telescope
              of the Van Vleck Observatory, situated on the campus of Wesleyan University.
              This instrument would be used at all levels of undergraduate astronomy
              education, including honors research projects, advanced laboratory courses,
              introductory laboratory courses and general education. It would also be used in
              formal educational and public outreach activities directed at local pre-college
              teachers and students. The proposed camera would have significant advantages
              over an existing, obsolete model. Besides improved reliability and reduced
              maintenance losses (time and money), the new camera will have four times the
              area, enable guided exposures, have a modem interface to support PC platforms,
              and be driven by much simpler, PC-based software. A11 of this will greatly
              improve our instructional capabilities in astronomy at Wesleyan.
