Abstract    :
                This project expects to improve computer networking education programs offered
              by expanding Horry-Georgetown Technical College's laboratory facilities to
              allow experiments.  The experiments will reinforce classroom work in all facets
              of network design, installation, maintenance, and management.  The laboratory
              equipment will allow us to build a wide variety of computer networking
              scenarios which represent the challenges faced in the science, industrial, and
              business world today.  In addition to integrating computer networking concepts
              and laboratory exercises into the curriculum for computing majors, the project
              will lead to a Computer Network Operations Certificate for non-degree seeking
              students and others returning to enhance their workplace skills.
