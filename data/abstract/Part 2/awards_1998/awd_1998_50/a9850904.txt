Abstract    :
               This project will set up a computer networking laboratory for Computer Science
              Majors. Students will get hands-on experience in setting up, configuring,
              monitoring and troubleshooting TCP/IP-based networks. The primary operating
              system they will use is Linux, which is a Unix-like OS that runs on Intel
              platforms. Students will also learn how to set up heterogeneous networks
              sharing files between Windows95/NT and linux operating systems. Experience in
              working in a heterogeneous environment is crucial in today's workplace.    This
              will be a multi-function laboratory. While the networking course will use the
              operating systems in one hard disk, a second hard disk will be configured to
              run Windows 95 and mathematical software such as Mathematica and Minitab. Thus,
              the lab will also serve some of our mathematics courses that depend on the use
              of software. This dual boot feature enables optimal use of the available
              machines, and serves as a model to overcome severe space problems.
