Abstract    :
              This project represents a collaborative effort by Alabama Southern Community
              College (Alabama Southern), the Center for Excellence in  Forestry, Paper, and
              Chemical Technology (Center for Excellence), the Chemical Engineering 
              Department of Auburn University, and the Pulp and Paper Research Education
              Center at Auburn University (Auburn University).  The goal of the project is to
              develop an industry-responsive pulp and paper and chemicals process training
              curriculum focused on 1) chemistry and processes laboratories and 2)
              industry-based student experiences.  The project integrates components from
              four associate degree programs in technology offered by Alabama Southern: (1)
              Paper and Chemical Technologies, (2) Electrical  Technology, (3) Electronics
              and Instrumentation, and (4) Industrial Maintenance.  The Center also
              facilitates use of project instructional  materials for continuing work force
              development by making project educational modules available to the technicians
              and operators throughout the nation.
