Abstract    :
              Computer controlled data acquisition and analysis systems have been integrated
              into the introductory laboratories for both science and non-science majors. 
              These laboratories are associated with General Chemistry, Equilibrium and
              Analysis, Accelerated General Chemistry, Accelerated General Chemistry
              Laboratory, and Perspectives in Environmental Chemistry. These five courses
              service all chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and pre-health-science, and
              environmental studies students as well as students not majoring in the
              sciences. More than 250 students use this equipment annually. In these courses,
              Students perform experiments that require significant amounts of data to be
              collected, processed, analyzed, and interpreted . This project focuses on the
              interpretation and analysis of observations rather on data collection. Examples
              of the many experiments that use the new data collection systems are
              determination of the heats of reaction in solutions, of heat capacities of
              metals, and of the order of reactions from kinetic measurements.  Also, the new
              equipment permits simultaneous measurements that allows two or three concepts
              to be integrated into a single experiment.
