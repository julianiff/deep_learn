Abstract    :
                           The Technical Sciences Academy (TSA) was established through an
              NSF/ATE grant award in 1994. This new proposal builds on the solid foundation
              of the 1994-1997 project in the following ways: it will develop a new
              biotechnology program; strengthen its articulation agreements with its partner
              institutions; upgrade its technology resources; and enhance the teacher/faculty
              development program.    TSA has resulted in a highly successful partnership
              between Amarillo College (AC), Amarillo Independent School District (AISD), and
              leading area industries. The activities of the new proposal will elevate TSA to
              a regional/national model. Dual credit agreements between AC and AISD will be
              augmented. Articulation agreements will be negotiated among TSA, AC, and
              regional universities to further a seamless education from the ninth grade
              through a Baccalaureate degree.    Collaborative faculty development and
              teacher training efforts, directed toward pre-service and rural in-service
              teachers, will be implemented. Activities emphasizing technology applications
              will be available on-site and via ITV. The education/industry partnership
              procedures now implemented at TSA will be refined into a system and distributed
              through various means, including consultancies, on-site workshops, and Distance
              Learning applications. An outside evaluator will measure assessment/data
              collection integrity and outcomes completion.               Amarillo College lV
