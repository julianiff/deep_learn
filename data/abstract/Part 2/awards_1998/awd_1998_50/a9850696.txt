Abstract    :
                The purpose of this project is to improve laboratory instruction in the 
              Molecular Biology and Biochemistry course at Saddleback College, a two-year
              community college. Our target audience is the biology majors who plan to
              transfer to four-year institutions. Currently students in Bio lC conduct
              laboratory exercises in protein isolation, enzyme kinetics, and nucleic acid
              isolation and analysis. We plan to augment our laboratory curriculum with the
              inclusion of experiments using UV spectroscopy. Students will use this
              instrument in enzyme kinetics experiments, measurement of protein and nucleic
              acids and for analysis of absorption spectra of biological molecules. The
              acquisition of this instrument for the biology laboratory represents the next
              phase in our on-going goal of developing a teaching laboratory in biochemistry
              and molecular biology laboratory equipped with up-to-date equipment and
              instrumentation.
