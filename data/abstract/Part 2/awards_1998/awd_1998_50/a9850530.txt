Abstract    :
                Integrated experiments designed to incorporate concepts from physics,
              chemistry biology, and pharmaceutics into the laboratory components of general
              and organic chemistry have been developed. The specific integrated experiments
              require FTIR spectral analysis. Qualitative, quantitative and chemical kinetics
              analyses are incorporated into these laboratory experiments. These experiments
              are intended for the undergraduate pharmacy curriculum. Sets of experiments
              with a common theme focus on integrating basic science concepts with pharmacy
              relevant examples. These laboratory exercises emphasize independent learning
              and critical thinking. A strong basic science education incorporating exercises
              to develop thinking abilities is essential in the preparation of pharmacy
              practitioners who will use this knowledge to adapt and develop drug therapies
              for patients. The laboratory is an ideal environment for active learning
              activities that help students develop the thinking abilities necessary for the
              practice of pharmacy.
