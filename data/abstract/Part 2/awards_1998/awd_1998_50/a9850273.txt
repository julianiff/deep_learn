Abstract    :
                This is a three year project which includes students from the Gateway
              Technical College in WI, Triton College in River Grove, IL, and the Art
              Institute of Pittsburgh, PA. The partners in this collaboration also includes
              The Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA), Trek Bicycle
              Corporation, and the Antarctica Support Associates (ASA). The project will
              promote a technologically advanced workforce, develop an innovative technology
              curriculum, and form strong linkages among artists, scientists, and
              technicians. Using problem based learning it will combine collaborative student
              design and fabrication projects with classroom curriculum based on real
              problems presented by the extreme conditions at Amundson-Scott South Pole
              Station. The long range impact of the project is to provide a better working
              environment for technicians working in extreme environments. Students will hone
              their high tech skills through apprenticeships which involve Gateway and Triton
              students working under the direction of polar engineers at the Yerkes
              Observatory. The project will involve 150 students yearly including 10
              apprentices. Students may earn 3-academic credits for their participation.
