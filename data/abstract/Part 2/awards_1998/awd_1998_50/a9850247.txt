Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the implementation of an educational context for
              students to develop a meaningful set of competencies recently developed by  
              the American Chemical Society (ACS).  They are collectively known as the
              Voluntary Standards for the Chemical Process Industries Technical Workers.  the
              U. S. Department of Education.  These standards, described in "Foundations for
              Excellence in the Chemical Process Industries", identify 8 major work areas
              containing 564 industry-based competencies based on actual tasks performed by
              laboratory technicians.    The new curriculum at Athens Areas Technical
              Institution in chemical technology integrates industry-based competencies into
              a workplace context for the education of chemical technicians.  Specifically,
              the project is working with (1) Athens Waterworks and Olin Chemical Company to
              develop a basic scenario on the chemistry of aqueous systems: (2) Hoechst
              Celanese to develop a quality and process control laboratory associated the
              polymer synthesis; (3) Athens waterworks and Olin Chemical Company to develop a
              quality and process control laboratory for metal recovery; and (4) Hoechst
              Celanese to develop a quality control laboratory associated with a
              pharmaceutical company.  Three of the four fully developed scenarios are being
              tested with students at Athens Area Technical Institution.  The project is
              mapping a complete two-year program that includes outlines of seven workplace
              scenarios with their associated competencies.  Dr. Kenneth Hughes at Kennesaw
              State University is developing the scenarios working closely with Dr. Hofstader
              to include appropriate components of the ACS Voluntary Standards and with Dr.
              White in the design, implementation, and testing of each scenario.
