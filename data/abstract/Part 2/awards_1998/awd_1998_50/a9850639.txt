Abstract    :
                The Engineering Technology Department at Western Kentucky University is in the
              process of upgrading its electrical engineering technology curriculum. As part
              of the curriculum revision, the Department will offer both classes and
              laboratories on fiber optic communications. The Department currently has
              insufficient fiber optic equipment to provide quality laboratory experiments
              for students; therefore, funding is requested for laboratory equipment to be
              used to analyze the transmission and reception of signals over fiber optic
              communications links. The fiber optic equipment will be utilized as follows: 
              1. provide a quality laboratory experience to support an electrical engineering
              technology fiber optics communications class,  2. provide support for the
              electrical engineering technology senior project classes,  3. provide training
              in the form of continuing education classes for local industry and high school
              math and science teachers throughout Western Kentucky University's designated
              service area in South Central Kentucky,  4. provide portable capabilities to
              conduct demonstrations in rural high schools that otherwise would not have this
              exposure, and  5.provide support for Physics 103 (Light, Color, & Vision)
              classroom lectures and laboratory exercises and Physics 441 (Optics) lecture &
              Physics 404 (Laboratory) courses.
