Abstract    :
              This project will support the establishment of a microcomputer Laboratory that
              will be used in mathematics courses from calculus through honors projects.  The
              overall objective is to encourage students to develop an experimental attitude
              toward mathematics by using the computer as a laboratory for strengthening
              intuitive insight, suggesting conjectures, and illuminating the theory and
              application of mathematics.    This project will have significant impact on
              Elizabeth City State University and can serve as a model for other small,
              predominately minority institutions of higher education preparing students to
              enter the 21-st century work force and encouraging students to pursue graduate
              work in mathematics.
