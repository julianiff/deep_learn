Abstract    :
               This project develops a computer communication networks laboratory. 
              Experiments conducted in the laboratory will examine the Physical and Data Link
              Control layers of the OSI Reference Model.  Design and implementation of the
              Token Ring and Ethernet Local Area Networks will be studied.    The project
              will result in an undergraduate laboratory and an associated laboratory manual
              for a course in computer communication networks.
