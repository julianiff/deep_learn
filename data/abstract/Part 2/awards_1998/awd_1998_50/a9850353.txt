Abstract    :
              The Dine College IETP program is designed to prepare students to enter the
              high-tech work force addressing the need on the Navajo Nation for computer
              technicians and network specialists.  Close collaborations with existing ATE
              programs ensure that Dine College faculty and support personnel have the skills
              necessary to offer training consist with national skills standards.  IETP
              students have the option of either achieving vendor specific certification to
              enter the high-tech work force or continuing with a four-year engineering
              program.    Partnerships with Navajo Nation programs, Arizona and New Mexico
              school districts, and regional high-tech industry guarantee that the course
              content remains sensitive to regional employers and that the program remains
              consistent with and linked to other regional initiatives.
