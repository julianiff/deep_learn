Abstract    :
              Modern molecular spectroscopy and micro-analysis experiments recently developed
              at UCF (Am. J. Phys. 62, 429-434 (1994)) will be introduced into the
              intermediate and advanced undergraduate laboratories. Undergraduate students
              are learning skills such as materials characterization by micro-Raman
              spectroscopy which will give them useful knowledge in preparing them for
              graduate school or entering the job market. They are taking advantage of the
              technological revolution that has taken place in this field during the past
              decade making small, low-cost, high-throughput instruments possible. These
              experiments fit very well into the undergraduate curriculum since they allow
              the students to investigate basic physics phenomena as well as many useful
              applications.  The laboratory is equipped with a Raman spectrometer employing
              solid state laser excitation and a microscope attachment. In the intermediate
              lab the students have hands-on experience with absorption, emission and
              fluorescence using multichannel detection. Experiments in the advanced
              laboratory focus on Raman spectroscopy and microanalysis of materials. The
              choice of laser crystals and diamond films as examples illustrate ways that
              physics can be applied to relevant topical issues. The new instrumentation are
              also being used in undergraduate research projects and demonstrations. This
              allows students to investigate concepts in current materials spectroscopy. As a
              result of this program students have an improved understanding of spectroscopic
              instrumentation and should become highly employable in the large laser and
              electro-optics industry that is evolving in the Central Florida region.
