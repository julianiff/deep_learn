Abstract    :
                This proposal will add new laboratory exercises in human physiology that will
              enable over 450 students per year to be active participants in the design and
              execution of experiments in the introductory biology and human physiology
              courses at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Twelve computer
              workstations will allow students to conduct experiments on muscle physiology,
              cardiology, respiration physiology and the reflex arc. Computer-based systems
              give precise, repeatable, numerical measurements that provide a framework for
              developing analytic skills and understanding scientific inquiry. The ultimate
              outcome of the project is to instill a working knowledge of scientific inquiry
              through student-designed experimentation that is closely linked to mastery of
              lecture content. A firm grounding in experimentation from the beginning of a
              student' s education will have a positive impact in upper level courses. A
              significant number of UTC graduates continue in health care related programs
              (medicine, dentistry, physical therapy and exercise science), graduate school
              and teaching. They will be better prepared to be future health care
              professionals, scientists and teachers.
