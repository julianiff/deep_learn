Abstract    :
              This project supports an NMR spectrometer dedicated to the instructional needs
              of undergraduate students within the Department of Chemistry. This
              instrumentation enables students to have "hands on" practical experience in NMR
              spectroscopy in a variety of courses throughout the chemistry curriculum.  The
              curriculum revisions include a new Honors course in Organic Chemistry (with a
              concomitant laboratory), an Advanced Organic Laboratory Course, and an
              increased emphasis on teaching spectroscopy throughout the chemistry major's
              program. Spectroscopy is also an essential component of the undergraduate
              research experience.  NMR now joins infrared spectroscopy and gas
              chromatography as a vital component of the organic laboratory beginning in the
              first semester of organic laboratory.  Students gain first-hand experience with
              a powerful tool for structural determination through a new sequence of
              experiments.  The NMR spectrometer provides advanced students the full range of
              experience with both 1- and 2-D pulse sequences but is also simple enough to
              introduce students to this technique in the first semester of organic chemistry
              laboratory.
