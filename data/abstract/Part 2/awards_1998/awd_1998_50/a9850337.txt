Abstract    :
              In response to industry need, this project develops and delivers a rigorous and
              transferable curriculum for an Associate Degree in Computers and Information
              Technology. This program serves as a school-to-work model for community
              colleges, meets the needs of students seeking entry level jobs and IT
              professionals seeking to upgrade their technical skills, and provides the
              necessary foundation for students who decide to transfer to four year
              institutions. In particular, the project develops and validates certification
              standards for entry level positions in high-performance companies.    IT
              representatives are selected from industry, academia and the public sector to
              identify the needed skill sets, soft skills are incorporated into the
              curriculum, internship experiences are made available to students, and
              certification of skill acquisition are to be based upon industry standards. The
              new curriculum is delivered via technology mediated learning (interactive CD
              and the Internet).    The target audiences for this project include students in
              high schools, community colleges and universities, particularly Latino
              students. It also includes IT workers retraining for jobs in emerging high-tech
              fields and faculty at high schools and community colleges. This project is a
              collaborative that includes Evergreen Valley College, East Side Union High
              School District, Foothill/DeAnza Community College District, San Jose State
              University, Workforce Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems, Oracle Corporation, CBT
              Systems, and  Waite Group Press.
