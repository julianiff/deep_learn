Abstract    :
              Institution-Wide Reform of Science Laboratories at Mount Holyoke

This three
              year institution-wide project aims to increase both the ability of students to
              use, evaluate, and value scientific results and methods and also the
              mathematical and statistical sophistication of their scientific analysis and
              inquiry. A group of more than twenty science faculty members at Mount Holyoke
              propose to do this by review and revision of laboratories in most introductory
              and core science courses. The aim will be to construct laboratories which not
              only teach technique, but which 1) develop students' ability to ask
              interesting, testable questions which give insight into the phenomena under
              study, and 2) underscore and enhance students' ability to use formal reasoning,
              mathematics and statistics to draw inferences from testable hypotheses. 

In
              addition to revising labs, the project will support the effort to build
              students' sophistication by changing parts of first and second year mathematics
              and statistics courses to use the new labs as contexts and sources of examples,
              and by maximizing points of contact between labs in different science
              courses.
