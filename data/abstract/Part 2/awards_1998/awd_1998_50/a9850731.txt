Abstract    :
                We propose to use 30Q MHz NMR in the undergraduate curriculum of three widely
              separated campuses in Alaska. This instrument will replace a 90 MHz instrument,
              which is currently the only functional NMR within the State of Alaska. The
              Chemistry Department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will incorporate the
              NMR into five existing laboratory courses; four of which have not previously
              had a NMR component in them due to present instrument limitations. In addition,
              a new capstone senior-level course will be developed to focus on structure
              determinations. The instrument will also be used in the undergraduate research
              program that is required of all chemistry majors. Students at the Anchorage and
              Southeast campuses will use the instrument in at least our courses, taking
              advantage of the instrument's networking capabilities and the existing computer
              network in the State. This proposal supports NSF core strategies of
              strengthening the physical infrastructure and developing intellectual resources
              in undergraduate education as well as the University of Alaska's strategic plan
              of being a leader in arctic research and education.
