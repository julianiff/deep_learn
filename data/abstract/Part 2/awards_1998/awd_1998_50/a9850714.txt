Abstract    :
              Computers, software and related equipment are being integrated into a molecular
              modeling laboratory to be used by chemistry students at all levels. Specific
              applications for the facility throughout our curriculum include:  1.
              construction and analysis of simple molecules using the VSEPR model and
              visualization of the electronic density distributions of polar molecules in
              general chemistry; 2. analysis of the stabilities, geometries and electron
              density distributions in reagents and reaction intermediates to explain product
              regiochemistry in organic chemistry; 3. visualization of the structural
              features of complex biopolymers to illustrate structure-function relationships
              and important enzyme mechanisms in biochemistry; 4. a structured study of
              molecular modeling, its assumptions, outcomes, and applications in physical
              chemistry; and 5. specialized applications in advanced courses and student
              research projects.
