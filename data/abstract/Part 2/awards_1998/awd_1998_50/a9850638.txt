Abstract    :
                The Department of Chemistry of Thiel College upgraded an existing Varian EM360
              continuous wave nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to a pulsed Fourier
              transform instrument capable of doing carbon-13, fluorine-l9 and phosphorus-31
              spectra as well as proton spectra. The ease of use and increased flexibility of
              the upgraded instrument makes it possible for students to have hands-on use of
              NMR throughout the chemistry curriculum starting in the freshman year and
              culminating in a research project in the senior year. The FTNMR is an integral
              part of the laboratory program of a multi-track chemistry major in which
              students can choose a biochemistry track or an environmental chemistry track
              instead of the normal chemistry major.
