Abstract    :
                Project ATEEST is providing curriculum development and faculty enhancement in
              alternative energy  transportation. Curriculum development activities include
              an electric vehicle technician two year certificate program, modules on
              alternative fuel vehicle environmental applications, secondary school electric
              vehicle technology materials, and laboratory experiments in electric vehicle
              technology.  Faculty enhancement activities include workshops for secondary
              teachers and workshops to prepare two-year college faculty to implement the new
              curriculum.
