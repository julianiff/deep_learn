Abstract    :
                  Western Wisconsin Technical College (WWTC) will introduce telemedicine
              technology support training at three levels.  First, to high school age youth
              through on-line (internet and videoconferencing) first year electronics
              courses, for which they will receive credit toward high school graduation and
              advanced standing towards an Associate' s Degree in Biomedical Electronics. 
              Second, the Associate Degree in Applied Science, Biomedical Electronics program
              will be modified to include telemedicine technology in its curriculum and
              bridge the gap between information systems and biomedical technology.  And
              lastly, WWTC will offer an Advanced Technical Certificate to update skills of
              technicians already in the field.    Curriculum and instructional materials
              will be developed and offered to the high school students. High school faculty
              will be offered a summer inservice workshop on core electronics instruction to
              prepare them to assist their students who are taking courses via video
              conferencing and Internet. Existing Biomedical Electronics curricula will be
              modified to include telemedicine, and Advanced Technical Certificate,
              Telebiomedical Technician curricula developed for updating technicians on
              telemedicine advancements. All curricula and teaching materials will be placed
              on an intranet/Internet for 24 hour a day access from anywhere. A model
              telemedicine site will be equipped in the lab, which will include
              videoconferencing capabilities, both for delivery of instruction to rural sites
              and for training purposes.
