Abstract    :
                This is a project to establish a 2+2 program to improve the preparation of
              technicians and technologists in a broad range of technology and science
              disciplines. This will be done through intensive summer programs, conferences,
              and internships. The program begins with an integrated course of study in
              eleventh grade. It will continue with context based, interdisciplinary
              mathematics-sciences-technology learning environment in grades eleven and
              twelve. It will feature a 5-week summer program for students during the summer
              between their senior year in high school and their freshman year in college.
              This summer workshop will emphasize integrating technology training with
              workforce skill development. SEATEC also will hold a Summer Conference for
              students, educators, and industry representatives. SEATEC will provide
              internships for students and training for teachers in technology, process
              education, and integrated learning. Phase I planning will focus on data
              collection and designing project procedures.
