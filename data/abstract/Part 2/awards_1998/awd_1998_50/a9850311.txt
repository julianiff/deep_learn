Abstract    :
                  Networking Communities addresses the critical need for a well-trained work
              force with diverse skills in computer network technologies. Two Massachusetts
              community colleges are teaming with high school and industry partners to (a)
              develop and implement a nationally replicable model for infusing computer
              networking curricula into existing programs; (b) demonstrate a model for joint
              professional development of in-school information technology expertise, where
              high school and community college faculty are assisted by industry;  (c)
              provide hands-on technical experiences for students, with special emphasis on
              creation of school network tech support teams and work experiences at local
              businesses and community organizations; and  (d) encourage timely, widespread
              replication through national dissemination.     At the community college level,
              the curriculum is specifically designed to conform to the industry-validated
              "Network Specialist" skill standards developed by the NSF/ATE-funded NorthWest
              Center for Emerging Technologies. At the high school level, students learn the
              basics of network technology as part of a school-to-work "career pathway" in
              Information Technology.
