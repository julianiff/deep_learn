Abstract    :
              A. Project Summary

An interdisciplinary team of faculty from SME&T
              Departments across the University, under the leadership of the Chemistry
              Department, will employ informational and instructional technologies (IT) to
              initiate and propagate the reform of undergraduate science, mathematics,
              engineering and technology (SME&T) education at Columbia. The faculty team will
              be joined by undergraduates, graduate students and administrators to form an
              "IT cluster" that will consist of innovators, change agents, and opinion
              leaders who are willing and capable of catalyzing the "diffusion" of the
              acceptance reform of SME&T education throughout the University so that reform
              can become comprehensive and sustainable in a rapid manner.

The goals of the
              IT cluster will be (1) significant improvement of the scientific and technical
              literacy of both science and nonscience majors; (2) an interdisciplinary
              collaborative engagement of university research faculty in the SME&T
              disciplines in the education of undergraduates from diverse backgrounds,
              interests and preparations; (3) the development of a reform model which can be
              transported to a wide range of educational institutions of higher education,
              including public and private research universities and colleges; (4) the
              development of IT materials at all possible levels as tools for educational
              delivery systems that are flexible and that recognize and accommodate different
              student preparation, skills and learning styles; (6) the establishment of
              outreach programs which establish partnerships with high schools in the NYC
              area, with selected small liberal arts colleges and with selected historically
              minority and black colleges; (7) continual assessment and evaluation and
              appropriate modification of the IT activities.
