Abstract    :
              Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) has developed a campus ecosystem model for
              teaching interdisciplinary science to both science and non-science
              undergraduates.  The model focuses on the tracking of matter and energy through
              the campus' watershed from its freshwater origins, through estuaries, and into
              nearshore marine environments.  Students participate in individual,
              collaborative, class-, and university-wide-active-learning through integrated
              research experiences. This approach:     1) provides students with hands on,
              real-world experience in science;   2) places undergraduate science education
              within a more explicit context;   3) integrates more traditional,
              discipline-based frameworks; and   4) encourages faulty from different
              disciplines to collaborate through the use of shared resources and learning
              outcomes.     The ability to collect accurate environmental data and then
              efficiently and precisely analyze it is fundamental to the success of this
              model.  This project will purchase and integrate into our program eight pieces
              of equipment (autoanalyzer, fluorometer, atomic absorption spectrometer, cold
              mercury vapor analyzer, conductivity detector for ion chromatography, physical
              water quality data sondes, electromagnetic flow meter, and large-format
              plotter) that are central to the study of our watershed's ecosystems.
