Abstract    :
              This project incorporates a state of the art High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph
              into primarily first and second year undergraduate science laboratories.
              Students utilize the instrument to perform quantitative and qualitative
              analysis of compounds relevant to the course material. Additionally, students
              are exposed to computer controlled instrumentation and data processing.  Use of
              the instrument answers the curricular need to expose students to chemical
              instrumentation and the analysis of non volatile samples early in their
              careers.
