Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the undergraduate plastics processing laboratory
              experience utilizing an injection blow molder to demonstrate the process,
              analyze the systems components, measure processing conditions and relate
              simulation analysis to the laboratory experience.   The students are using
              leading edge computer technology, including solid modeling, finite element
              analysis, mold flow, mold cooling and polymer flow.  The comprehensive
              laboratory experience results in an understanding of the operation of
              processing machinery.  Students will also develop and manage an engineering
              project and present the project before their peers and professionals in their
              field.
