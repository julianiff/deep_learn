Abstract    :
              Among the practical procedures that are most important in modern chemical Among
              the practical procedures that are most important in modern chemical
              laboratories are data acquisition and analysis, quality control and quality
              assurance (QC/QA), and the use of laboratory information management systems
              (LIMS). It is important that chemistry and chemical engineering students be
              exposed to all of those procedures. At present, the faculty teaching analytical
              chemistry to undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh are restricted in
              their ability to provide instruction in QC/QA and LIMS techniques because there
              are not enough computers to handle the student load, and the existing
              laboratory computers are not networked to a central database. Eight new
              computers, a server, printer, and network hardware/ software form the required
              networked system for use by students in the analytical chemistry/instrumental
              analysis laboratory.  The new equipment allows completion of a project to:  1)
              modify current experiments and introduce new experiments that utilize the
              computer network for data analysis and display; 2) establish a centralized
              database of instructional material and help files; 3) set up a LIMS database
              and set of procedures; 4) develop laboratory manuals that  contain both theory
              and experiment to teach QC/QA and LIMS concepts and 5)  produce computer-based
              instructional material.
