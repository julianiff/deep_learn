Abstract    :
                  The Biology Department at the University of West Florida is integrating
              molecular biology experiences across the curriculum, thus providing students
              with relevant examples for application of this technology. All Biology majors,
              not just Molecular Biology majors, are being exposed to the methodology and the
              range of problems that may be investigated and solved at the molecular level. 
              This project is:  (1) introducing plant molecular biology experiences for upper
              division students and  (2) expanding the variety of published plant molecular
              biology experiments designed for classroom use. The experiments build upon
              molecular biology exercises already provided in the lower division General
              Botany course.
