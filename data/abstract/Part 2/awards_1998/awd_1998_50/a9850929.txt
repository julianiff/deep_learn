Abstract    :
                In this proposed project, equipment will be provided for seniors in the
              department of electrical engineering taking senior design. Matching support for
              twenty projects covering two years is being requested. Through this support,
              student design teams will be able to build, test, and  demonstrate electronic
              devices which they have designed on paper. Through this hands-on experience,
              the students will gain    A far better understanding of electrical engineering
              through hands-on experience,      A far greater understanding of how the
              subjects and tools presented to them over the past three years apply,     
              Experience working in a team environment (since each project is completed by a
              "team" of 2-4 students)~ and      Exposure to the design process, from concept
              to working prototype.      Further, the devices designed, built, and tested in
              senior design will enhance the education and recruitment of engineers
              throughout the educational process. Many of these projects will be focused on
              developing specialized laboratory experiments and equipment. These projects
              will then allow small universities, colleges, and K- 12 schools to obtain
              equipment for their laboratories which were either too expensive or
              nonexistent. Additional projects will originate from local industries, giving
              the students, faculty, and company employees exposure to the needs and
              capabilities of each other. Each of these projects (once completed) will be
              presented to the sponsor and other students on campus - aiding with recruitment
              and retention of undergraduates through demonstrating how some of the tools
              they are learning can be applied.
