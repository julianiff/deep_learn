Abstract    :
              This project is designed to achieve the following goals: 1) Introduce Workshop
              Physics style laboratories at the University of Wisconsin - LaCrosse, for an
              increasing number of students taking calculus physics, and 2) to enhance
              learning in the physics laboratory for the average student, particularly
              Physics/Engineering Dual Degree majors and other science majors. The project is
              using a networked Microcomputer Based Laboratories (MBL) in the laboratories
              that are part of the calculus based introductory physics courses. These
              courses, General Physics I, II (Physics 203, 204), are being run very much in
              the Workshop Physics style, although the formal lecture sessions will be kept
              as well. Such a model has already been implemented in a modest fashion in the
              algebra based physics course. Implementing this project is enhancing the
              education of future scientists and engineers in a cost-effective way. In
              addition, students in "Broad Field Science," teacher certification program,
              students satisfying their General Education Program science requirement, and
              students in various pre-professional programs (medicine, physical therapy
              etc.),who take this course are also benefiting. Finally, science teachers
              participating in summer workshops will also use this laboratory.
