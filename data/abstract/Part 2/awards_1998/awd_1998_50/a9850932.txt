Abstract    :
                  Our long-term goal is to develop a novel Teaching Factory which will enable
              undergraduate students to gain realistic hands-on, multi-disciplinary
              experience and apply their knowledge in science, mathematics, and engineering
              to solve problems that arise in a realistic environment consisting of an
              industrial grade automated manufacturing system. Our vision is to weave this
              unique laboratory experience throughout the undergraduate curriculum while
              effectively capturing the richness of the problems encountered in modern
              production systems in all their important dimensions. As first step in
              realizing this vision, we propose to develop an instructional laboratory in
              which students will design and construct prototype machinery capable of light
              manufacturing using industrial grade components. The unique feature of this
              laboratory is that students will construct these machines from "scratch" using
              open architecture controllers and instrumentation to ensure full access to the
              internals of these student-built machine tools, robots, and other equipment.
              This will eliminate proprietary black boxes and enable unhindered learning
              while stimulating inquiry and creativity. This is a particularly appropriate
              time for this project because we will moving our laboratories to our
              Department's new home in the Leonhard Building.
