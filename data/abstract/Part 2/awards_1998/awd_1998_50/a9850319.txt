Abstract    :
              The project implements a sequence of dissemination and teacher training
              activities over 20 months for instructional materials developed under a
              previous grant (DUE 9553689). The materials form a comprehensive two-semester
              course in physics for technicians and other audiences. The materials emphasize
              conceptual understanding of fundamental ideas (as opposed to routine
              application of formulas to template problems) and active learning by students
              (which makes ideas vivid to the senses, not just leaving ideas as abstract
              concepts). The course contributes to the core education of technicians, making
              them more thoughtful in their work, more flexible within their companies, and
              adjustable in their employment throughout their careers. The dissemination and
              teacher training activities include: a teacher's manual to guide instructors in
              the use of the materials; modularization to make the material usable in a
              custom publishing format and as stand-alone demonstrations; summer workshops to
              train pairs of community college/high school teachers in use of the materials;
              Science Saturdays conducted in Austin by the development team and by the summer
              teacher pairs who return home to become "teachers teaching teachers"; workshops
              at the major professional meetings of groups like ITEA, AVA, NSTA, AAPT, and
              statewide directors of tech-prep programs;  expansion of a Web site to include
              a listserv/chat room format in which teachers can share ideas and ask
              questions; and continued interaction with major publishers.
