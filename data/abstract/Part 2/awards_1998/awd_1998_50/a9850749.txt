Abstract    :
              The basis of this project is to improve the computing facilities available for
              undergraduate Math majors at East Central University. East Central University,
              located in rural Oklahoma, has a strong Teacher Certification program and is
              also ranks highly in terms of the number of Bachelor degrees granted to native
              Americans. The Department of Mathematics currently has very limited and
              antiquated computing facilities, which denies students the opportunity of an
              education which exposes them to tech- nology, such as that which they will
              subsequently encounter in industry or graduate school. This lack of exposure to
              computing technology also impedes students' competitiveness in seeking
              employment upon graduation. With updated computing equipment, Mathematics
              majors, and especially those in the Honours program, will be able to
              incorporate modern technology into their studies, thereby enriching their
              educational experience and better preparing them for future encounters with
              technological innovation.
