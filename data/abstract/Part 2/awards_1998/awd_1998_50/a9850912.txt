Abstract    :
              The overall purpose of this project is to introduce scanning probe microscopy
              (SPM) into the science curriculum at Lebanon Valley College (LVC). The project
              will be supervised by the Department of Physics at LVC with the following main
              objectives. (1 ) Integrate SPM into both introductory and advanced physics 
              courses and laboratories at LVC.  (2) Develop and offer a one-credit course on
              SPM for upper division students (e.g., biology and chemistry students) who have
              completed one year of introductory college physics. This course will use senior
              physics students who have been trained on SPM as  laboratory teaching
              assistants.  (3) Develop and use demonstrations/short laboratory exercises to
              support courses offered by the chemistry and biology departments as well as the
              Master of Science Education program at LVC (a program designed for elementary
              and secondary school teachers).    In addition, the SPM will serve as a focus
              for physics student /faculty research at LVC, and assist the department in its
              outreach programs to local high schools and industries. This interaction has
              the potential of not only introducing SPM concepts into the high schools but
              SPM instrumentation as well.
