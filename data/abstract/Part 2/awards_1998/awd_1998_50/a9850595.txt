Abstract    :
                This proposal would establish an undergraduate Geographic Information Systems
              (GIS) instructional computer lab that would enable the Department of Geography
              and Planning, in cooperation with two research/education centers at Buffalo
              State College, to expand its course offerings, undergraduate research
              opportunities and to develop new and innovative K-12 curricula and teacher
              training tools. The requested instrumentation would serve to develop new
              courses in computer mapping for elementary and secondary education majors and
              to develop a summer workshop to provide similar training to teachers; to
              increase the effectiveness and number of computer mapping and GIS courses
              offered by the Department for its majors and other non-education majors; to
              increase opportunities for undergraduate students to undertake supervised
              research projects on social and environmental problems; and to develop within
              the Department a new course in the application of GIS methodology in the
              analysis of environmental and conservation issues. The project will be
              coordinated with the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis
              (NCGIA) at SUNY Buffalo and in service teachers through the New York Geographic
              Alliance. Project results will be disseminated through standard academic
              outlets as well as in a national Conference on GIS in K-12 education organized
              by the NCGIA at SUNY Buffalo, the NCGLA at the University of California, Santa
              Barbara, and the Department, to be held in Buffalo during the course of the
              project. In addition the results will be presented in panel discussions on GIS
              in Undergraduate Education to be held at the 1998 and 1999 Annual Conferences
              of the Middle States Division of the American Association of Geographers.
