Abstract    :
                  The Borough of Manhattan Community College is developing a cohesive and
              unified curriculum in Multimedia Programming and Design in partnership with
              Murry Bergtraum High School. Courses are being developed and/or redesigned to
              include the use of collaborative learning and multimedia instructional
              technology. BMCC is working in partnership with Murry Bergtraum High School and
              industry representatives to develop the curriculum, which allows students to
              move efficiently from secondary education into an associate degree program in
              Multimedia Programming and Design. In addition, the project provides faculty
              development in the use and integration of advanced multimedia technology
              instruction and collaborative learning to full-time faculty and high school
              instructors from the New York City region. This exemplary program serves as a
              national model for other colleges and high schools seeking to reform their
              programs, to ensure that underrepresented groups are attracted to and retained
              in those programs, and to provide opportunities for secondary and postsecondary
              faculty to collaborate in improving the quality of advanced technological
              education.
