Abstract    :
              The college's chemistry and biology programs are being strengthened by the
              addition of a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph Flame Ionization Detector/ECD
              System, an inlet and detector to equip a second GC with FID capabilities, and a
              High Performance Liquid Chromatograph with diode-array detection capability.
              The FID upgrade to an existing HP system allows greater student access to FID
              capabilities, using existing the ChemStation data system and GC. These
              acquisitions are infusing new technology into existing experiments, adding new
              experiments to the curriculum, adding HPLC experiments to the Nutrition
              laboratory program, adding both GC and HPLC work to a Forensics Science Course,
              and providing appropriate laboratory experiences for the Environmental Science
              Program at the college. In addition, the new instrumentation is being used for
              talented high school students and for inservice training of county teachers.
              Estimated annual use of the instrumentation is 500 undergraduates, 50 county
              high school students, and 50 county high school teachers. Over 70 percent of
              these individuals are members of groups underrepresented in science.
