Abstract    :
              This project will continue the efforts of Project TEAM (Technical Education for
              Advanced Manufacturing).  The partners in Project TEAM include Cleveland State
              University (CSU) and its Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC), the Cleveland
              Advanced Manufacturing Program (CAMP), Cuyahoga (CCC), Lakeland (LCC) and
              Lorain County (LCCC) community colleges and their respective Tech Prep
              Consortia, Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU), and the 102 manufacturing
              companies that have sponsored projects. The activities center on the concept of
              a teaching factory, called the Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC), that
              provides hands-on learning for participants who work on industry sponsored
              projects. The overarching goals of Project TEAM are to stimulate interest in
              all phases of manufacturing in the Northern Ohio region and to provide a well
              educated manufacturing workforce through the development of a continuum of
              manufacturing education and training programs that will allow multiple entry
              and exit points.  The specific goals are to (1) ensure the long-term
              sustainability of the newly established MLC locations at Lakeland and Lorain
              County Community Colleges as laboratories for hands-on manufacturing learning;
              (2) support innovative teaching methods among secondary math, science, and
              technology teachers and engineering and technology faculty in the community
              colleges and universities; (3) support student success in manufacturing-related
              technology educational programs; and (4) ensure systemic educational reforms by
              fully integrating curricula additions and revisions into each partner
              institution.
