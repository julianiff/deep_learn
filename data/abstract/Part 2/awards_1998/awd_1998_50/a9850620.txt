Abstract    :
                This is a project which is making a radical shift in the methods by which
              basic laboratories in Materials Science and Engineering are taught to all
              engineering students. The primary targets are second year students from:
              Aerospace, Civil, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering, numbering about 500
              per year. In addition, about 50 students per year with majors and/or minors in
              Materials Science and Engineering are being affected. All these students have
              in common a strong need to understand the mechanical properties of solids. The
              idea is to impart the practical meaning of complex and abstract data used for
              the engineering design of every day products. In the past, most experiments
              were confined primarily to observation and data gathering. This problem is
              overcome using multiple stations, each with a small student team and employing
              a computer interfaced to sophisticated experimental apparatus. Experiments are
              relating practical applications (e.g. the strength of fasteners or welds in
              realistic environments) to the limits of data obtained from standard tests and
              specimens (e.g. from tensile or impact machines). Microstructural data using
              multiple imaging and collection systems is being correlated to mechanical
              properties in every instance.
