Abstract    :
                This project will have an immediate impact on our students majoring in
              biology, enabling the University to develop an undergraduate
              sophomore/junior/level cell biology course. Advanced microscopy laboratories
              employing fluorescence microscopes equipped with contrast-enhancing optics,
              video image acquisition and analysis systems are being developed for cell
              biology and our courses in immunology, medical microbiology, microbiology,
              physiology and molecular biology. These new exercises take special advantage of
              many of the exciting new fluorescent probes available for studying living and
              fixed cells. These activities will increase the "hands-on" participation of our
              students in project-oriented laboratories. In many instances students will work
              on investigative projects designed to employ the advanced features of these
              microscopes. The results will be a significant revitalization of the biology
              laboratory curricula. The University is contributing an amount equal to the
              award.
