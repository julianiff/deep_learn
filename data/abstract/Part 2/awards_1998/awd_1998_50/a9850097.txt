Abstract    :
              Three major science education issues are educational technology, problem-based
              learning, and teaching integrated science. Change is difficult because of the
              present structure of single discipline-based teaching. This project is changing
              the core curriculum to one which uses educational technology to teach
              integrated science by tying courses from different disciplines together via
              computer simulations and problem-solving pedagogy. Early in their education
              students begin to see that the sciences have commonalties such as the
              scientific method, quantifiable and verifiable data, the use of statistics and
              probabilities, and critical thinking.  Computer simulations do not replace but
              extend the laboratory experience, whether in geology, biology, or physics. By
              integrating disciplines and having students work in teams on simulated problems
              as an extension of the lab experience, our project revitalizes the science
              curriculum by transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries and
              incorporating educational technologies.
We are incorporating integrated
              science-based computer simulations into classrooms in a problem-solving format.
              Student teams attempt to solve complex and important problems, such as global
              warming or deforestation whose solutions require knowledge and skills drawn
              from many different scientific fields.
