Abstract    :
              This project incorporates an on-going molecular and biochemical study of ureases
              into the laboratories of several upper level biology and chemistry courses at
              Austin College. Students in each of the target courses  carry out different but
              complementary experiments aimed at better understanding the genetics,
              regulation and biochemistry of microbial ureases. At the end of each semester,
              students in the target courses participate in a symposium in which they share
              their findings. This project provides students with laboratory experiences that
              are on-going and investigative, and that cut through the boundaries of
              individual courses so that students emerge with a more integrative view of the
              sciences. This collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to teaching science
              models the methods of doing research in the scientific community. These
              experiences help prepare students for careers in health sciences, industry,
              research, and teaching.
