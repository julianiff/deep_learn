Abstract    :
                A bench-scale continuous catalytic reactor with automated chemical analysis,
              data logging and control capabilities will be assembled from purchased
              components for use in undergraduate laboratory instruction in the Department of
              Chemical Engineering at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Students will
              design experimental protocols and operate this equipment in three different
              undergraduate classes: the current senior Unit Operations laboratory course;
              the sophomore Methods and Measurements laboratory; and the upper-class division
              independent directed study course taken by highly motivated students. For the
              Unit laboratory, reaction kinetics fundamentals and catalyst activity,
              selectivity and performance as a function of temperature and pressure will be
              taught by reactions such as n-butane over a platinum-loaded zeolite catalyst.
              For the sophomore measurements lab, experimental design, statistical analysis
              of data, introductory diffusional effects, and dimensional analysis will be
              taught with simpler experiments, such as trace analysis for residence time
              distribution and adsorption isotherm determination as functions of temperature
              and pressure. Independent studies depend on the students and professors
              involved. The addition of a continuous kinetics experiment is part of an
              ongoing updating effort which includes complementary sets of batch and
              continuous experiments in the undergraduate laboratory.
