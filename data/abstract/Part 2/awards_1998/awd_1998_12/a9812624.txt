Abstract    :
              The relatively new, and still evolving experimental techique of "Particle
              Tracking Micro Rheology" will be employed to investigate the rheological
              properties of two distinct biopolymers: actin networks and genetically
              engineerd protein gels.  Further development of the PTMR technique will provide
              important benefits to the rheological community.  The selected biopolymers are
              of interest to the biomedical as well as the rheological communities.
