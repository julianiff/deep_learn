Abstract    :
              	The goal of this project is to ascertain the degree to which the Quasi-biennial
              Oscillation (QBO) of the stratosphere and tropical deep convection are related.
               The co-principal investigators found in a preliminary study which compared
              interannual variations in outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) in the tropics
              with a proxy for the QBO, the stratospheric zonal winds measured at Singapore. 
              The correlation for the 12-year period was large enough to warrant further
              exploration.  Drs. Hitchman and Martin will extend the period of their study to
              23 years and will also investigate whether regional differences can be
              detected.  In the course of the study, they will examine a number of
              meteorological parameters near the tropopause with the hope of gaining insights
              into the possible physical mechanisms involved.  They will use a variety of
              data sets:  OLR data from several satellite instruments, Highly Reflective
              Cloud data, standard meteorological analyses from the European Centre for
              Medium Range Forecasting and reanalysis products from the National Centers for
              Environmental Prediction.   The results of this study should provide insights
              into the nature of large-scale tropical convection and the possibility of using
              the state of the tropical stratospheric winds for long-range forecasting of
              tropical convection on a regional basis.
