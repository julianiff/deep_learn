Abstract    :
              A partnership will be formed between Cornell University and key engineering
              institutions on the island of Puerto Rico (initially to include the Puerto Rico
              Resource Center for Science and Engineering, the University of Puerto Rico at
              Mayaguez, and the Polytechnic University), to identify star students early in
              their undergraduate careers.  These students will be resident on the Cornell
              campus for one summer of course work and either on campus or at the Arecibo
              Observatory in Puerto Rico for one research-intensive summer.  The students
              will, where appropriate, be encouraged to apply to either the M.S./Ph.D.
              program directly or to Cornell's one-year M. Eng. Program.  With summer
              research experience and the chance to excel in the M. Eng. Program, we believe
              many of the later students will also be able to continue to the Ph.D.
