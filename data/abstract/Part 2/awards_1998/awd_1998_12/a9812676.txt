Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the continuing research of Dr. Nicholas J. Turro of the Department of
              Chemistry at Columbia University.   The proposed research involves
              collaborative investigations of the structures and dynamics of a variety of
              supramolecular systems in which reactive intermediates are generated by uv
              photolysis.   Included are geminate radical pairs and biradicals generated in
              micelles, radicals, radical pairs, and biradicals generated on the external and
              internal surfaces of zeolites, and supramolecular assemblies resulting from the
              interactions of DNA with dendrimers.   Enantiomeric selection in spin chemistry
              will be explored, including possible connections between angular momentum,
              optical activity, and molecular chirality.

Fundamental investigations are
              proposed to characterize novel materials with unusual properties, and to
              elucidate mechanisms of binding of small guest molecules to biomolecules.   The
              work is interdisciplinary and has potential applications in catalysis, size and
              shape selective separations, and materials science.   It will integrate
              research and education by actively involving undergraduate and graduate
              students at Columbia in research projects coupled to instruction through the
              use of the world wide web and other  information technologies.
