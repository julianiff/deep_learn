Abstract    :
              9812159 Alleman This is a project to conduct laboratory based research on the
              potential use of thermophilic aerobic biological processes for treatment of
              high strength industrial wastewaters as measured by their chemical oxygen
              demand.  The research involves obtaining fundamental information on performance
              characteristics of the processes with respect to their steady-state operation
              and alternative procedures to counteract the expected poor settling
              characteristics of the resultant biomass.  The research will be conducted using
              a synthetic deicing fluid as representative of the type of wastewater for which
              the proposed process is likely to be considered as an alternative to anaerobic
              microbial processes.    

Results of this project are expected to provide
              engineering design criteria for a thermophilic aerobic treatment process to
              reduce the pollutional impact of high strength, biodegradable industrial
              wastewater streams.  These criteria are expected to include guidelines for
              suitable operating regimes and reliable performance characteristics with which
              industries can develop integrated treatment systems for addressing point-source
              process wastewater streams of pollutants as well as pollutants from diffuse
              sources.
