Abstract    :
              9812632  Naftali  The 1998 IEEE-AP Conference on Antennas and Propagation for
              Wireless Communications (APWC) will be the first in its field of interest to
              bridge the gap between academia and industry.  The Antennas and Propagation
              Society of the IEEE believes it is critical to bring these two groups together
              to discuss the latest problems and solutions in antennas and propagation as
              they relate to the rapidly expanding wireless communications.  APWC is
              scheduled for November 2 to 4, 1998 in Waltham, MA at the Westin Hotel.    This
              project requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for young
              investigators whose papers have been selected for an oral presentation at the
              Conference.
