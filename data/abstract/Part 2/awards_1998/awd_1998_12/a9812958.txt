Onyemelukwe
While experiencing an unprecedented growth in student
              enrollment, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the
              Structural/Geotechnical Group (SGG) at the University of Central Florida (UCF)
              have been developing research and education programs with limited and
              insufficient testing facilities.  The university has committed to construction
              of a sizable laboratory for large-scale testing of structural members and
              systems.  This award will permit acquisition of a structural test system and a
              data acquisition system for the new facility.

This equipment will
              significantly enhance the large-scale structural testing facility and will
              allow the SGG to conduct static, fatigue, and pseudo-dynamic tests on
              large-scale components and sub-assemblies.  The new system will also allow the
              SGG to conduct integrated research studies combining both analytical and
              experimental work using in-house facilities. In addition to serving as its
              primary research function, the new large-scale structural testing laboratory
              will have a secondary educational purpose.  Both graduate and undergraduate
              students will be engaged in some of the research projects.  Interesting
              research projects will also be integrated into appropriate classroom settings
              and instructional programs. Easy access to such a laboratory facility at UCF
              will afford students the opportunity to better visualize some of the subjects
              taught in the classroom.
