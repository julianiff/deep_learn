Abstract    :
              9812204  HANSELL  This project will replace the two main engines on the Research
              Vessel WEATHERBIRD II during it's scheduled ship yard visit in September 1998.
              WEATHERBIRD II is a general purpose research ship owned and operated by the
              Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR), Inc., a Bermuda-based United
              States non-profit research and education institution. The replacement diesels
              (Lugger 6140 AL2) will increase engine overhaul interval from our current
              <10,000 hr overhaul interval to 20,000 hr. By extending the overhaul intervals
              they will reduce maintenance costs, both in parts and labor, and in ship
              down-time. Fuel savings in each new engine will be 3 gal/hr, reflecting a 12%
              reduction in fuel consumption.   The project is under the direction of Dr.
              Dennis Hansell.  ***
