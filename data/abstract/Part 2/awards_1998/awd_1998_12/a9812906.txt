This is an Exploratory
              Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Reseach Center
              for Sensors and Actuators.

The research exploits the recent development of a
              novel laser liftoff process for the integration of functional thin-film
              materials and heterostructures with Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS)
              assembled onto virtually any substrate, enabling separate optimized processing
              of two or disparate materials systems prior to assembly. This process is suited
              to many functional thin film materials and heterostructures .The salient
              feature of the liftoff process is the nanosecond-timescale decomposition of a
              thin interfacial layer through the transparent substrate. The process is very
              rapid, can be performed in the laboratory ambient, no special sacrificial layer
              is required,  and the peak temperature at the film surface is substantially
              below the decomposition temperature, and the selected-area liftoff is readily
              achieved.
