This is a 24 month award proposed by Drs. Ping Liu and David
              Sellmyer, University of Nebraska, collaborating with Dr. Zhi-Dong Zhang, the
              Institute of Metals Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Dr. Liu requests
              funds for the P.I.s' travel, the U.S. student's support, per diem for the
              Chinese scholar, one month P.I.'s salary,  and supplies to carry out a
              cooperative project with his counterpart at the Institute of Metals Research,
              Chinese Academy of Sciences.  This project proposed to develop high
              energy-product magnetic films using the intergrain exchange coupling of
              mechanical alloying.  The researchers are competent, experienced and highly
              respected in this field.   The topic is important, and the potential  impact of
              this study on science and technology is high.  The  result of this project may
              lead to improved magnetic and magnetic-optic storage media and
              magnetoelectronic devices requiring relative high-coercivity.  This project
              also provides an excellent opportunity for training graduate students.  This
              project is jointly supported by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
