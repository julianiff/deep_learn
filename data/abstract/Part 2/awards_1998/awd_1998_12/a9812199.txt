Abstract    :
                The University of Oregon operates the Oregon Institute of  Marine Biology
              (OIMB) as a field station that supports  research and educational activities
              focusing on  ecological interactions and organismal functions in  marine and
              estuarine environments.  Resident faculty,  visiting scientists, post doctoral
              researchers, and  graduate students conduct research year round, and three 
              terms of course work are offered for undergraduate and  graduate students.  The
              Institute is currently undergoing  a period of modest growth in both facilities
              and programs  guided by a programmatic and facilities planning  document.  New
              facilities, increased visitor use, and the  addition of courses for
              environmental science students at  the University of Oregon have made it
              essential that OIMB  we improve its computer network to provide more reliable 
              access.  This project will allow to improve OIMB its  computer network to:     
                1.  Accommodate new construction of a library and an  estuarine and coastal
              research laboratory, and  renovation of a building to a new research
              laboratory.        2.  Replace the existing network wiring with a  switched 
              Ethernet capable of handling larger loads at faster  speeds.        3.  Expand
              the network to research and housing spaces  for visiting scientists, and to the
              teaching  laboratories.        4.  Add three new work stations for use in the 
              teaching  laboratories.
