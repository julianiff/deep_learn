Abstract    :
              9812506  Galligani  MSTAR - RSI  (California Rural Systemic Initiative) 
              Developmental Proposal    A core group of program planners representing the
              University of California (UC) Office of the President; the MESA (Mathematics,
              Engineering, Science Achievement) academic support and enrichment program; the
              Indian Natural Resources, Science and Engineering Program at Humboldt State
              University; and the Navada Indian Environmental Coalition, has gathered
              together a larger body of stakeholders who are interested in planning and
              implementing a Rural Systemic Initiative proposal for northern California and
              Nevada.  The project will be established in a region with 238 candidate rural
              schools, which enroll 11,000 American Indian students, and a total of 173,503
              students, half of whom are economically and educationally disadvantaged.  The
              planning process will entail hosting a series of facilitated and structured
              dialogues among the parents, community members, teachers, school
              administrators, and representatives of higher education, private industry, and
              community groups in each of five areas of the region, in order to build a
              shared vision of standards-based education and goals; and will also take the
              initial steps toward establishing the long-term, divers educational community
              needed to support significant systemic educational reform in the region,
              particularly in the subject areas of mathematics, science and technology.    3
