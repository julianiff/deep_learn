This is an
              Exploratory Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center 
for Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research.

 The
              research will examine the precipitation behavior of titanium nitride in
              low-carbon steels produced via thin-slab casting, with the objective of
              developing new alloying approaches for the production of high strength steels. 
               Because the cooling rate in thin-slab products is greater than for continuous
              casting or ingot casting, it is expected that this will have a profound
              influence on the solid state reactions of titanium nitrides at high
              temperatures.  This should lead to a scientific basis for new HSLA (high
              strength low- alloy) steel alloy designs.
