Abstract    :
              ECS-9812691  Thomas    This project requests support for the travel of U.S.
              academic researchers to attend the fourth in a series of major international
              symposium on dynamic phenomena in bulk electric power systems. This symposium
              will be held in Santorini, Greece, August 22-26, 1998.  The subject of dynamics
              and control, especially in light of changing institutional arrangements, is
              vital to the reliable operation of the U.S. inter-connected power system.  This
              particular symposium will involve papers and discussions from researchers in
              Europe and throughout the world.  Participation by the U.S. university
              contingent will be ensured through this grant.
