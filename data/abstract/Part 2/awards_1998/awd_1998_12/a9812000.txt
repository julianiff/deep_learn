Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation is now examining the future roles, number, and
              support for U.S. mathematical sciences institutes, and has suggested that the
              National Research Council help inform that examination.  Specifically, this
              project would (1) examine the role of the institutes in furthering mathematical
              research; and (2) in the context of assuring the future health of the nation's
              mathematical research enterprise, recommend whether any changes in the current
              configuration of the U.S. institutes are warranted--their nature, number, and
              operating modes.
