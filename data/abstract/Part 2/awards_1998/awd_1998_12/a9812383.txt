This grant will allow students and junior researchers to
              attend a workshop which will focus on physics opportunities available with the
              Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST).  The workshop is widely
              advertised internationally, and plenary speakers have been invited from the
              most closely connected programs worldwide.  Involvement of junior researchers
              at the earliest stages of this project will be very beneficial.
