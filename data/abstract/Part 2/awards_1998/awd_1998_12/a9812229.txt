Abstract    :
              The NSF Information and Data Management Program Workshop, held in Washington,
              D.C. on March 29-31, 1998, has the objective to bring together the researchers
              currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the
              National Science Foundation, along with selected industry and government
              invitees in order to cooperatively (1) identify the problems that are
              fundamental in making progress towards the integrated management of data and
              information; (2) specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; and
              (3) identify research infrastructures needed to meet current and future
              challenges. This workshop aims at enabling communication and future
              collaboration among researchers from the different communities involved in the
              IDM, including database research, information retrieval, multi-modal
              information management, and distributed (networked or wireless) heterogeneous
              (palmtop through mass storage) systems. Further, the workshop provides an
              opportunity to examine the current research efforts and to learn more about
              successes of the researchers funded by the IDM program. The workshop
              proceedings will include reports on all projects funded by IDM during the
              fiscal year 1997. The findings of the workshop will be presented in a report
              that will help in formulating future directions of research in information and
              data management and will suggest promising modalities of research in academia
              and industry with an aim to foster innovation as well as technology transfer.
              The workshop material will be widely disseminated in both hard copy and
              electronic form on the IDM Web site, in order to inform wide audience about the
              IDM program successes and future research directions.
