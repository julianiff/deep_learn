Abstract    :
              ECS-9812713  Baillieul     Support is requested for travel subventions to be
              given to participants in an upcoming meeting/conference entitled "Brockettfest,
              A Conference on Mathematical Control Theory, Honoring the Work of Roger W.
              Brockett. The conference will be held in the Boston area over two days, Friday
              and Saturday, October 23-24, l998.  The meeting will be organized around
              technical domains to which Brockett has made important contributions, and
              because there is such breadth and diversity in his accumulated work, we expect
              very broad interest and participation from the systems and control community.
