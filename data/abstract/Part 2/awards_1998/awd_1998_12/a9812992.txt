Abstract    :
              9812992  Graham  The influence of random microstructures on thermoelastic 
              stress concentrations in Functionally Graded Materials (FGM)  is examined. A
              moving-window technique is used whereby the  micromechanics model, known as the
              generalized method of  cells, is used in combination with stochastic finite
              element  methods.  Such formulations allow to pick up the effect of  local
              stress concentrations, that are linked to local  variations in material
              properties,  on damage phenomena.  The developments allow the tailoring of
              material  microstructure to obtain a superior performance of the FGMs  under
              high thermal gradients.  ***
