Abstract    :
                9812513  DeGrandpre    Scientists at the Univ. of Montana, Rutgers University,
              and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution   will collaborate to develop an ocean
              CO2  profiling capability using underwater technology at Rutgers   University's
              Long-term Earth Observatory (LEO-15) and secondly, to characterize CO2 
              variability at   this coastal location.  Work will consist of augmenting an
              existing profiling system so that it will   acquire data from autonomous
              biogeochemical sensors, including a Submersible Autonomous Moored   Instrument
              for CO2 (SAMI-CO2), O2 and light sensors, and a chlorophyll fluorometer. The
              profiling   system will obtain time and depth-resolved PCO2 , calculated total
              CO2  (TCO2 ), dissolved 02,   chlorophyll fluorescence and light intensity. The
              high resolution vertical measurements of CO2 , in   combination with the other
              biogeochemical parameters, will provide necessary data for biogeochemical  
              models and for estimating water column biogeochemical inventories. Real-time
              data acquisition and   remote control of the profiler will be incorporated for
              testing specific questions regarding CO2  cycling.   The work will determine if
              CO2  profiling significantly advances our ability to study and understand the  
              marine CO2  cycle. If proven successful, the research may set the groundwork
              for a global scale   network of in situ biogeochemical profilers to
              characterize ocean biogeochemical cycles.
