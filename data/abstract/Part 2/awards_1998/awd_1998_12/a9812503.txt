Abstract    :
                  9812503  Gordon  This project is funded as part of the U.S./Japan
              Cooperative  Research in urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation activity, a 
              U.S./Japan Common Agenda initiative.  The project aims to develop  a
              cross-cutting methodology for seismic risk assessment and  management of urban
              transportation infrastructure systems through  U.S./Japan research
              collaboration.  The approach integrates  engineering, systems analysis and
              economics.  Three related tasks  will be carried out: (1) Development of
              performance criteria and  design of mitigation strategies, (2) modeling
              transportation and  economic system response in earthquake disasters, and (3)
              economic  evaluation of mitigation strategies.  In Task 1, the U.S. role will 
              consist of developing performance criteria based on transportation 
              accessibility measures, working with Japanese counterparts on  alternative
              criteria based, for example, on reliability  engineering, and designing
              associated retrofit and repair  strategies for evaluation in the
              transportation-economic model.   Research in Task 2 will focus on improving and
              expanding upon the  L.A. Highways model.  This effort will emphasize modeling
              of  earthquake damage repair and associated bottlenecks using  experience data
              from Kobe in order to evaluate the benefits of  faster network recovery. 
              Modeling expertise will be shared with  the Japanese team as they build similar
              models for Japan.  In Task  3, U.S. and Japanese researchers will collaborate
              on evaluating the  benefits and costs of retrofit and repair strategies, and
              assessing  the economic implications of the performance criteria identified in 
              Task 1.    This is a joint project carried out by investigators at the 
              University of Southern California and the University of Washington  ***
