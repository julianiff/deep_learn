The underrepresentation of ethnic minority students in the
              sciences reflects neglect of a significant part of this country's human
              resources.  The consequences of such neglect will affect the ability of the
              United States to improve its future global scientific competitiveness to meet
              the economic and societal challenges of the 21st century.  Through the Minority
              Geoscience Scholarship program, the American Geological Institute (AGI) seeks
              to increase the representation of ethnic minority students in the geosciences
              by enhancing and expanding the support of undergraduate ethnic minority
              students interested in specializing in the geosciences.  Historically, AGI has
              been a leader in Earth Science education and in support of geoscience minority
              student scholars.  In the past 25 years, AGI has established a reputation for
              identifying, recruiting, and maintaining ethnic minority students in the
              geoscience pipeline.
