Abstract    :
              The objective is to improve understanding and develop numerical simulation of
              shock structure in gas-particle supersonic jet flows, and the interactions with
              boundary layer of the flow and acoustic field.  The particle presence changes
              the flow structure of a shock wave, the onset of flow separation and acoustic
              emissions as compared to single fluid flow.  A combined experimental and
              computational investigation will be undertaken, including design improvement
              for supersonic jet nozzles.   Pressure fluctuations will be measured in a
              particle-laden jet in a variety of configurations.  The simulations will be
              based on Lagrangian description of the particle motion and large eddy
              simulation of the mixture.  This is a GOALI project in collaboration between
              the University of Cincinnati Propulsion Laboratory and Cold Jet Incorporated. 
              The proposed research has relevance to various propulsion systems, combustion,
              jet cleaning and cutting, as well as to the general development of
              understanding of two-phase supersonic compressible flows.
