Abstract    :
              The Kew Marine Laboratory was constructed in 1971-72.  In  addition to the
              building and its excellent sea-water system,  the laboratory was equipped with
              essential core equipment,  including a large-capacity water-distilling system,
              a  laboratory-glassware dishwasher, an autoclave and a liquid-  scintillation
              counter.  In the subsequent 26 years, the  Kewalo Lab has provided the space
              and facilities for  outstanding research by resident and visiting scientists
              and  for graduate and postdoctoral training.  Recent renovations,  at state
              expensive, have renewed the building structurally,  replaced an aging,
              PCB-containing transformer, built a new  sea-level pump house for the sea-water
              system, replaced the  central water-distilling system with a reverse-osmosis 
              system, and provided hard-wire computer contact with the  main University of
              Hawaii campus.  This project will worn  out dish washer and autoclave and the
              outmoded liquid-  scintillation counter, all of which are essential, on site, 
              to the research activities of all who work at the lab, and  provide computers
              for a central system that will allow  researchers in the lab to share
              peripheral hardware and  build a database on occurrence, reproduction and
              development  of common Hawaiian marine animals.  The redefined goals  statement
              for the Kewalo Marine Laboratory sets the focus on  "bio-molecular interactions
              in coastal environments," with  an emphasis on organismal biology, utilizing
              the most up-to  date technology and molecular approaches to answer questions 
              on development and recruitment, sensory biology, symbiosis,  microbial ecology,
              environmental biology,enviromental  biology, population/evolutionary biology,
              and the effects of  introduced species
