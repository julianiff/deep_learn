Abstract    :
              9812498  Egbelu   This project contributes to the establishment of a
              collaborative exchange program at the postgraduate level between the United
              States and the Republic of South Africa in the area of manufacturing research
              and education. It supports graduate students traveling from the United States
              to South Africa during the summer of 1998 to perform research under the
              supervision of South African faculty who are collaborating with their counter
              parts in the U.S. Similarly, funds are to be provided by the Foundation for
              Research Development in South Africa for support of South African students
              traveling to the United States under the collaborative effort. This activity is
              developed as a follow-up of the U.S.-South Africa Manufacturing Research and
              Education Collaboration Workshops held in March and May of 1997.     The
              activity is an excellent development extended from the recent U.S.-South Africa
              Manufacturing Research and Education Collaboration Workshops. The collaborative
              exchange program is especially beneficial in developing the international
              perspective of participating students and promoting cultural understanding in
              research and education.
