Abstract    :
              Cores containing intellectual property (IP) are being used  widely for
              cost-effective and timely design of systems-on  chip (SOC). This presents a
              problem for manufacturing test  in that cores contain proprietary information,
              and effective  test methods are difficult to develop. This research is 
              developing a new Query/Request (Q/R) paradigm to enable  development of tests
              for a SOC without obtaining direct  access to the core vendors' IP. New
              procedures for  simulation, fault simulation, test generation are being 
              explored. These procedures encapsulate information about  each core, and
              provide only certain types of information  that do not contain IP in response
              to a Q/R from the system  level module. A system level module to develop tests
              for the  entire SOC is also being developed. Tools being developed  under the
              Q/R paradigm research include fault simulators,  test generators, procedures
              for design-for-testability  (DFT), and built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry.
