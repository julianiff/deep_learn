This project is to develop and expand a newly-discovered
              method for the synthesis of an advanced class of nitrogen-phosphorus polymers
              known as polyphosphazenes.  The new approach involves a "living" cationic
              condensation polymerization of phosphoranimine monomers at room temperature to
              give polymers with controlled molecular weights, narrow molecular weight
              distributions, and the capacity to form block copolymers with organic
              macromolecules.  The program will emphasize copolymer formation, star-branched
              and dendritic polymer synthesis, and the growth of polyphosphazene chains from
              organic polymer surfaces.

This work is in the area of new polymers that
              should be useful as non-flammable textiles and building materials, or as
              components in aerospace and automotive engineering.  In addition, applications
              are possible for these polymers in advanced solid state batteries and in
              biomedicine.
