Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This project is the second generation analysis and modeling of
              seismological data from the Mantle Electromagnetic and Tomography (MELT)
              experiment conducted on the East Pacific Rist at 17 degrees South.  The goal of
              this analysis is to develop a comprehensivew model based on models of mantle
              flow and melt generation that satisfies all the different types of
              seismological data simultaneously.  There wil be four phases of analysis;
              analyzing seismic data and waveform information that have not yet been
              exploited, inverting all the seismological constraints jointly to find a
              three-dimensional, self-consistent model, testing 3-D anisotropic forward
              models based on physical principles and guesses about the flow pattern, and
              incorporaing other constraints, including working toward a joint interpretation
              with the team of modelers of the electromagnetic data.
