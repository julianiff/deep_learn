Abstract    :
              This award will support a coordinated experimental and theoretical program
              directed at understanding the characteristics of multi-dimensional shocks
              propagating in weakly ionized gases.  The aim is to understand the role played
              by the space charge and the shock curvature in modifying the shock
              characteristics as compared to neutral shocks.  A novel technique for
              generating these shock waves is proposed which will make it possible
              investigate the effects of transverse (to the direction of shock propagation)
              particle flows as result of shock curvature.  Moreover, the dimensions of the
              experimental chamber (50cm x 100 cm) as well as the techniques for generating
              the plasma will make it possible to greatly reduce the influence of the chamber
              wall and the discharge generating circuit on the charged particle distribution
              in the shock.  The data generated in the experiments will be used to validate
              the multi-dimensional shock code which will bedeveloped to assist in the
              interpretation of the results, and to provide a starting point for model-based
              control in future work.
