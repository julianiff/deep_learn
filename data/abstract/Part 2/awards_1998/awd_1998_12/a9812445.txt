Abstract    :
              9812445  Parker  This is an award to provide renewed support for the operation
              of  the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of  Engineering,
              National Research Council's Water Science Technology  Board.  This Board
              provides a focal point for studies related to  environmental engineering and
              hydrology.  The Board's objective  is to improve the scientific and
              technological basis for  resolving important questions and issues relating to 
              management  of water resources.  This award is jointly supported by the 
              Environmental Engineering element of the Environmental and Ocean  Systems
              Program in the Engineering Directorate's Division of  Bioengineering and
              Environmental Systems and by the Hydrologic  Sciences Program in the
              Directorate for Geosciences, Division of  Earth Sciences.    An important
              function of the Water Science Technology Board is to  conduct studies and to
              sponsor workshops and conferences that can  be utilized for program planning
              purposes.  The Board also  functions as an appropriate means for coordination
              of research  plans with other Federal agencies including the Federal Emergency 
              Management Agency, Geological Survey, Environmental Protection  Agency,
              Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers.  ***
