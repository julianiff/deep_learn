Abstract    :
              9812206  Valle-Levinson    This project is for an observational and numerical
              study of  the wind-induced exchange between an estuary and adjacent 
              continental shelf.   The scientific objectives are to:  1)  determine the
              spatial structure of wind-induced current;  and 2) examine the importance of
              remote and local wind on  the sub-tidal exchange process.  The field program
              consists  of moored and shipboard observations, and the numerical  simulations
              will be used to interpret observations and to  generalize observational
              findings to other estuaries.
