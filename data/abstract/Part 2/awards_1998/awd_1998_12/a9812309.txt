This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Research award is for
              "The Second Polish-U.S. Workshop on High Temperature Conductivity," under the
              chairmanship of Dr. Bogdan Dabrowski of Northern Illinois University and
              Professor J. Klamut of the Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research
              of the Polish Academy of Sciences as Wroclaw.  Two years ago, the first
              workshop in this series provided a unique opportunity for Polish and U.S.
              scientists to meet and develop lasting interactions.  It also provided for a
              young Polish researchers forum to meet with the leaders in this field, attend
              their lectures and learn of the latest developments.  The second workshop is
              tentatively scheduled to be held in Poland on August 17-21, 1998.  Six of the
              twelve U.S. speakers will be with the Science and Technology Center for
              Superconductivity.

This research in physics fulfills the program objectives
              of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
