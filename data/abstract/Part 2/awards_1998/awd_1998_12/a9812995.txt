Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
EEC-9812995 
Adair/PSU   
 
This is an Exploratory Research Project
              to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center 
for
              Particulate Materials.

The goal is to develop particulate alloys through
              self-assembly phenomena, so that solid state properties of the nanometer cores
              potentially in ordered arrays may be determined. The objectives of the research
              are to determine (a) if particulate alloys and compounds can be developed using
              solid state rules, (b) the effect of size scale on self-assembly, and (c) if
              they can be developed with unique and tailorable electrical and optical
              properties.
