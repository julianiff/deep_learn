Abstract    :
              Several aspects of two-fluid atomization will be investigated by experimental
              and theoretical means: the mechanisms of ultrasound modulated atomization,
              application of capillary wave theory, and the role of Taylor-mode breakup of
              capillary waves.   Ultrasound modulation will be compared to piezoelectric
              modulation in pressure swirl nozzles.  The research will explore the
              performance of an invention of the P.I. that take advantage of the resonance
              between liquid capillary waves generated by ultrasound and by higher velocity
              air.  A theoretical approach of atomization is proposed based on the linear
              theory of amplitude growth rates of Taylor and Jeffreys.  The ultrasound
              frequency and power flow parameters, turbulence level, and fluid rheological
              properties will be varied during the experiments.  Undergraduate and graduate
              students will be involved in the project.  If successful, the work will
              contribute to improved production methods for uniform droplets and powders,
              with potential applications in advanced materials, spray coating, and waste
              minimization.
