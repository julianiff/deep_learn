Abstract    :
              This action is to support a preliminary assessment and planning for the seismic
              instrumentation of the Loma Los Colorados waste disposal facility in the
              outskirts of Santiago, Chile.  

The Loma Los Colorados solid waste facility
              is now under construction.  The region is exposed to frequent  earthquakes, and
              some great earthquakes have shaken the region in historic and modern times. 
              For example, in October 1997, the region was shaken by a magnitude 7
              earthquake.  At the present no comprehensive strong motion acceleration data
              form landfills exist.  Yet, observations are crucial in order to validate
              results from existing numerical models.  Until adequate data sets are obtained,
              predictions form these models of existing and proposed landfills will remain
              questionable.  Therefore, the central and southern region of Chile is an ideal
              location in which to instrument engineered structures in anticipation of strong
               accelerations from earthquakes.

KDM, Inc. The behavior of solid waste
              landfills during earthquakes is a subject of concern to the designers and
              builders as well as to those who live near them.  The builder of the Loma Los
              Coloados waste fill, has agreed to handle the installation, monitoring, and
              support of the instrumentation, and to report any records promptly to the
              international scientific community.  This is an ideal opportunity  to obtain 
              strong motion data form an instrumented landfill shaken by a major
              earthquake.
