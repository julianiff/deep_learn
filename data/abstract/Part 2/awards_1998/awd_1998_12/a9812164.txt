Abstract    :
              Asynchronous designs are an attractive alternative to  synchronous designs due
              to their lack of clock skew  problems, potential for average-case delays,
              adaptability to  physical properties, and power savings. This project focuses 
              on techniques for performance-analysis and performance-  driven synthesis that
              together can facilitate the design of  high-performance asynchronous circuits.
              For performance  analysis, the investigator is exploring analytical and 
              simulation-based analysis techniques that can guide  architectural design as
              well as guide controller synthesis  tools to optimize for user-specified system
              performance  metrics. For synthesis, the research is leveraging off an 
              existing technology mapping tool that uses minimal system  information to
              identify and then optimize common  transitions. By increasing the amount of
              system information  available, selected critical transitions can be optimized. 
              In these designs common transitions need not be critical and  critical
