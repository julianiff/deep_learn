Abstract    :
              A significant portion of formal (mathematical) analyses in the social and
              behavioral sciences during the last half-century has been organized around the
              modelling of choices and defining an operational concept of rationality, both
              for individual decision makers and for collective decision makers (i.e., social
              institutions).  This training workshop, to be held at the University of
              California, Irvine in summer 2000, will provide a detailed introduction to such
              formal approaches in three substantive areas where the research effort has been
              intense and shows no sign of abatement, namely:  individual decision making in
              the presence of uncertainty and intertemporality; collective decision making in
              political institutions; i.e., the democratic sharing of decision power among
              citizens with conflicting opinions; and fair division of economic and other
              resources when the recipients have different tastes, needs, or
              responsibilities.  For each area, the theories propose some normative answers
              (justified by precise axiomatizations and algorithms) and provide some
              descriptive models (driven by data from the social and behavioral sciences).
