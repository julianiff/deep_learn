Abstract    :
              Runtime systems are critical to the implementation of parallel programming
              languages and libraries.  They provide the core functionality of a particular
              programming model and the glue between the model and the underlying hardware
              and operation system.  As such, runtime systems have a large impact on the
              performance and portability of parallel programming systems.  Despite the
              importance of runtime systems, there are few forums in which practitioners can
              exchange their ideas, and these are typically forums showcasing peripheral
              areas, such as languages, operating systems, and parallel computing.  This
              Workshop on Runtime Systems for Parallel Programming (RTSPP) will provide a
              forum for bringing together runtime system designers from various backgrounds
              to discuss the state-of-the-art in designing and implementing runtime systems
              for parallel programming.  Rather than focusing on languages or compilers, the
              focus of RTSPP is squarely on runtime system design and evaluation.
