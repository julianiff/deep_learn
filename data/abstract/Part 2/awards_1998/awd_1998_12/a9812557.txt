Abstract    :
              The 1995 Hyogoen-Nanbu earthquake claimed more than 5500 lives and caused damage
              in excess of 100 billion dollars.  Gas, water, and electric utility lines
              reptured.  Bridges and overpasses on highways, railroads and subways collapsed.
               High-rise residential and office structures were severely damaged.  Liquefied
              soils settled and spread laterally along the coarse and in docks, piers, sea
              walls, and quays.  Kilometers of docks and quay walls titled and settled both
              at the coast and in the man-made islands, Port Island and Rokko Island.  The
              entire port of Kobe was almost completely destroyed.  This urban disaster
              resulted from a earthquake striking directly within a densely populated urban
              area.  A similar devastation was fortunately avoided in the San Fernando Valley
              in California since the 199 Northridge earthquake released its energy away from
              populated areas.

This action is to support a collaborative research program
              involving a team of US and Japanese researchers.  The US side includes
              professors and students form Cornell University, Rensselaer Polytechnic
              Institute, and the University of  Southern California.  Several US government
              and industry organizations have also agreed to cooperate in the proposed work,
              including the new Center for Advanced Technologies in Earthquake Loss Reduction
              [CAELR- formerly NCEER], the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), U.S. Army
              Corps of Engineers, U.S> Geological survey, and Woodward-Clyde Consultants.  On
              the Japanese side, the team consists of professors and students form Kyoto
              University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, University of Tokyo, Waseda
              University, and Yamaguchi University.  Several Japanese government and industry
              organizations will also contribute to the research effort.  

The main
              objective is to investigate the effects of liquefaction induced deformation on
              foundations and lifeline systems in the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu
              earthquakes, and to propose engineering solutions to mitigate these devastating
              effects in future earthquakes.  The findings of the research teams will
              contribute to the implementation of performance-based design in geotechnical
              and structural engineering in the United States and Japan.
