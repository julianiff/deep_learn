Abstract    :
              Investigators continue studying the coronal oscillation spectrum and its
              implications on solar coronal heating, through eclipse observations of 2/28/98,
              and with further theoretical and observational investigations.  Existing
              observations test mechanisms to explain solar corona heating via weakly
              compressive magnetohydrodynamic waves, generated along magnetic field lines in
              closed loops in the lower corona, and at the same heights which open fields
              form the solar wind.  In addition to reducing this existing data, investigators
              will test their coronal heating theories during the 8/11/99 eclipse in Europe. 
              Finally, these coronal studies, performed during eclipses, continue to attract
              active undergraduate involvement.
