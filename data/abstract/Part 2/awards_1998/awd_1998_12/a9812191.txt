Abstract    :
              This award to Professors Leonard Interrante and Thomas Apple at   Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute is supported by the Advanced Materials   and Processing
              Program in the Chemistry Division. The theme of the   research is the design,
              synthesis and characterization of   polycarbosilanes as ceramic precursors and
              functional polymeric   materials. Three main directions will be explored: (1)
              synthesis and   applications of new poly(silylenemethylenes) and their
              hyperbranched   analogs; (2)investigation of chain dynamics, crosslinking, and
              pyrolysis   of poly(silaethylene) and other polycarbosilanes; and (3) synthesis
              and   characterization of new poly(silylenemethylene)-polysiloxane copolymers. 
               Silicon-containing polymers structurally analogous to all-carbon and  
              polyphosphazene polymers will be prepared and their properties compared.  
              Targeted applications will be ceramic precursors for silicon-carbon,  
              silicon-carbon-oxygen and silicon-carbon-nitrogen ceramics,   polyelectrolytes
              for lithium batteries and open network microporous   solids.  This
              interdisciplinary award will combine silicon chemistry with polymer   science
              and will expose students to real world applications. A broad   range of
              activities ranging from monomer synthesis, polymerization,   polymer
              characterization and chain dynamics to property measurements of   derived
              ceramics, electrolytes and mesoporous solids will provide a rich   learning
              environment and possibly  lead to new silicon-based materials.
