Abstract    :
              The examination of risk management and communication are areas central to the
              field of ethics and values studies of engineering, science and technology. The
              present project will draw upon data from videotaped interviews and training
              sessions obtained during a ten week research trip to South African coal mines,
              in order to investigate the ways experts, including expert miners, and
              translators employ both speech and gesture to represent their embodied and
              analytic knowledge of risk in difficult technical and institutional contexts.
              Initial analysis of expert and novice miners' gestures suggests that gesture
              might provide clues to the ways that experts construct strategic
              representations of risk outside of written reports and procedures, and raises
              questions about the ways that engineers, managers, and translators might also
              employ gesture to communicate risk to audiences    particularly when audiences
              do not share the same education, language, and literacy in science and
              technology. Specifically, this project will (1) compare expert and translators'
              verbal (oral and written) representations of risk; (2) compare expert and
              translators' embodied and analytic viewpoints in speech and gesture; (3)
              identify features of the rhetorical situation that influence trainers' and
              translators' strategies, discourse conventions, and interpretation strategies;
              (4) identify features of cross cultural difference that influence training
              strategies, discourse conventions, and interpretation strategies; (5) describe
              audience expectations and analysis of the rhetorical situation; and (6) draw
              conclusions about the ways that experts employ speech and gesture to translate
              risk in difficult cross cultural contexts. While this research uses South
              African mines as one particular site of cross cultural difference, the problems
              of translating risk are not unique to South Africa. As US corporations expand
              their manufacturing and production sites in a global economy, risk
              communicators must translate safety practices across other, perhaps less
              visible cultural and scientific boundaries. Ultimately, this project will draw
              theoretical conclusions about the ways that an understanding of gesture can
              help experts, translators, and interpreters overcome the cultural and
              linguistic limits of written and oral representations of risk and expand
              knowledge of the relationship between language and the involvement of science
              in life activities.
