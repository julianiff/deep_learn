              ABSTRACT 
EEC-9812960 
Thomas/Cornell Univ.    


This is an Exploratory
              Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              
for Power Systems Engineering

This joint project will to develop
              innovative methods for visualizing the data associated with network flows in
              the electric power field.  Visualization and animation capabilities of
              computers will be used to help users of the transmission system see important
              data and trends. The objective is to create and develop a prototype based on
              the new ATC (Available Transfer Capability) calculations proposed by the North
              American Electric Reliability Council.  This should result in more efficient
              utilization of large-scale power distribution.
