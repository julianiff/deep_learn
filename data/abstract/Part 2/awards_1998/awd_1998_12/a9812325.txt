This three-year award provides for collaborative research
              with Michalis Vazirgiannis at the Athens University of Economics and Business
              in Greece on dynamic data allocation in distributed systems.  The three
              objectives of the research are to establish principles of adaptive replication
              in distributed systems; to develop, implement and analyze a system for adaptive
              replication of objects; and to build a simulation testbed in which the user
              defines the network and selects a replication algorithm, a cost model, and an
              access pattern.  The system will enable comparison among various adaptive and
              static algorithms.  

The project combines Wolfson's experience in adaptive
              replication with Vazirgiannis' expertise in spatio-temporal databases, which is
              critical for the development of the simulation testbed.  The project is
              expected to contribute to the development of the distributed, wholly
              interconnected information environment using the Internet and the World Wide
              Web.
