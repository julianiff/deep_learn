The project quantifies the damage due to different
              sources in aging structures, estimates the severity of the quantified damage,
              and integrates the developments into an intelligent system so that it can be
              used to empirically predict the fatigue failure and fatigue life of aging
              materials and structures. The system provides a safety index to assess
              long-term durability and size effects on aging structures. The intelligent
              system and associated developments are validated through a series of selected
              cases from aging aircraft structutes.***
