Abstract    :
              9812763  Chang  A series of international workshops on materials research, 
              technologies, and education will be held following the  success of similar
              workshops in Saltillo, Mexico (1995) and  Brussels, Belgium (1996).  The next
              two workshops will take  place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (June 8-10, 1998) and 
              Honolulu, Hawaii (November 2-4, 1998).  A third will be held  in Africa.  For
              the Rio workshop, participants from  Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the U.S. will
              be invited.  Themes will include:  energy/transportation, infrastructure, 
              communication, and education.  For the Hawaii workshop  participants from the
              following countries will be invited:  China, Japan, South Korea, Russia,
              Australia, Singapore,  Malaysia, Taiwan, India, and the U.S.  Topics for that 
              workshop will include:  energy/transportation,  education/policy/informational
              network, and research  resource management.  The workshop in Africa is
              currently  under planning.  %%%  The programs of the workshops will focus on
              discussions of  topics pre-agreed upon by the organizers from the 
              participating countries.  The goal of the workshops is to  enhance
              international collaboration in materials research,  technology, and education.
              To assure that this goal is  realistically met, a materials World-Net that will
               electronically link materials-related international sites is  being developed.
               This activity is jointly supported by the  Division of Materials Research and
              the office of  Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS, the Division of  Chemical
              and Transport System in ENG, and the Division of  International Programs in
              SBE.  ***
