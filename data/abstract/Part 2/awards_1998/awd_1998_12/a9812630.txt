Abstract    :
              This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the development of interactive
              formally-grounded courseware for teaching both mathematics and computing.  The
              courseware is created by a modern proof development system, Nuprl, based on its
              reference library of formal computational mathematics.  This project builds on
              earlier work in the area and 1) adds targeted lessons as entry points to the
              corpus of formal mathematics, 2) gathers feedback from students and instructors
              for evaluation purposes, and 3) includes work necessary for utilizing the full
              Nuprl interactive capability when it becomes available on the Web in 1999.  The
              project is creating easily used and novel educational technology by modifying
              existing research tools and incorporating ideas from the practice of machine
              assisted reasoning to make plain the conventional logical structure of
              mathematics text.  It has the potential to make a broad impact.
