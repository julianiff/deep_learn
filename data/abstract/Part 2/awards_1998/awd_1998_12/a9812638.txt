Abstract    :
                9812638  Terray    This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project  
              involves a feasibility study of making measurements of currents   in a seafloor
              hydrothermal vent field using a downward-looking,   broadband acoustic Doppler
              current profiler (ADCP) mounted on the   JASON remotely-operated vehicle. The
              ADCP will map the large   scale currents with respect to the physical structure
              of the vent   field. Such measurements can be used in conjunction with  
              thermistor moorings to estimate the advective heat flux. Another   objective is
              to develop a rough index of fluid temperature based   on the ping-to-ping
              correlation of the Doppler return. If   successful, this work will add an
              important hydrodynamic   measurement to the techniques needed to characterize
              the heat   output of vent fields.
