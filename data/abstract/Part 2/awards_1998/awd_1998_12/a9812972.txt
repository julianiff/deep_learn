Abstract    :
                Hunter-Gatherer Settlement of the African lowland rain forest of equatorial
              Guinea       The colonization of lowland tropical rain forests could be part of
              the global expansion undertaken by the human species during the Pleistocene.
              Although it is believed that this was  accomplished by hunter-gatherer peoples,
              the age of the initial  settlement, the type of landscape involved, the nature
              of human  adaptation to a closed forest environment, and the extent to which
              environmental manipulation took place are subject to much academic debate. 
              Previous research in the eastern lowland tropical Africa suggested that in the
              Ituri region, often considered a forest refuge, close to the savanna
              environments of the Western Rift, human colonization could be 15,000 to 20,000
              years old. In addition environmental evidence indicates that, although
              continuously forested, this region experienced dramatic changes in forest
              composition and structure from the Late Pleistocene to the present  This Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research extends the research to the evergreen forests of
              the western Congo Basin, in continental Equatorial Guinea.  Six months of
              exploratory survey and test excavation will occur in four districts of
              Equatorial Guinea. These are essentially unknown archaeologically, except for
              brief surface surveys in the late 1950's and 1980's. These districts were
              chosen because they include the second major forest refuge in Africa,  as well
              as comparable geomorphologic, sedimentary and taphonomic environments to those
              of the Ituri, where fauna remains and phytoliths provided evidence on past
              environments. The main research will contribute towards reconstruct
              environmental structure and changes through time, and will document the history
              of human occupation of this important region of the world.
