Abstract    :
              9812245  Dong  The First Korea-U.S. Joint Seminar on Biomedical Engineering is
              to occur during May 21-23, 1998. The general objectives of the meeting are to
              promote and establish a concrete relationship between Korea and the U.S. in the
              biomedical engineering field.  Biomedical Engineering is one of the 18 recently
              initiated national projects in Korea.  

This joint international seminar is
              designed to provide opportunities to share recent biomedical research
              activities in both the U.S. and Korea, and, importantly, to establish
              collaborative research relationships between the two countries.  An implicit
              purpose of developing cooperation with the Korea Science and Engineering
              Foundation is to engage in a productive mechanism that ensures the results from
              novel and important biomedical engineering research will devolve to both
              parties. An important outcome expected form the seminar is the identification
              of priority areas for future cooperation.  Therefore, the seminar is designed
              to include experts representing a number of areas of biomedical engineering:
              cell and tissue engineering, biomechanics, instrumentation; biomedical imaging;
              biomaterials; and human physiological functions.

The Seminar is a satellite
              meeting of  the Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering "1998
              Spring Conference". During their stay in Korea, the 12 U.S. participants in the
              Seminar will make site visits to leading Korea research centers such as the
              Daeduk Research Complex and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology,
              thereby providing additional opportunities to discuss potential research
              collaborations.
