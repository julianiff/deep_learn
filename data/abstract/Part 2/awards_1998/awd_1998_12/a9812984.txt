Abstract    :
              9812984  Tseng  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to demonstrate the
              feasibility of a novel means of producing complex three dimensional shapes of
              metallic materials by a freeform fabrication system. This project involves
              building a prototype system, based on the planar layer deposition technology
              and consists of a planar jet generator equipped with adjustable nozzles, pairs
              of rollers for pressing, cooling, and leveling, and a deposition chamber
              equipped with a position-controllable substrate. A sheet or layer with a
              desirable width formed by the planar jet generator contributes toward the final
              three-dimensional structure.   The planar layer deposition approach changes the
              current freeform fabrication concept from point-to-point forming to
              layer-by-layer deposition and as a result, will dramatically improve the
              production rate. The generator crucible is designed to achieve temperatures up
              to 1000 degrees centigrade. A relatively low melting temperature metal will be
              selected for freeforming a metal part with a 0.2-mm accuracy during this
              project to prove the concept and potential capability of the planar layer
              deposition technology.
