Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9812669  University of Missouri, Rolla  Antonio Nanni, PI 
              "Planning Grant for Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Repair
              of Buildings and Bridges with Composites"    This award funds an
              industry/university planning meeting to develop an operational
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Repair of
              Buildings and Bridges with Composites (RB2C) at the University of  Missouri,
              Rolla.   Ten companies related to the repair and rehabilitation of buildings
              and bridges using composite materials have expressed an interest in joining
              this center.  The proposed I/UCRC will address:   (1) development,
              understanding, manufacturing, and use of more durable construction materials;
              (2) installation processes and engineering design; (3) monitoring and
              evaluation of repaired structures; (4) standardization and code approval of
              products and design protocols; and (5) education and technology transfer.  
              Thirteen faculty plan to work in the center from four departments: civil
              engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical/aerospace engineering
              mechanics, and chemistry.  In addition to its research activities, the center
              proposes curricular changes at the university to incorporate its research
              results into education as well as providing technical training for the
              construction industry workforce.
