This award provides partial support for an updated assessment
              of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) science.  The study is motivated by
              significant changes in the field since the release of the 1994 FAMOS report. 
              The study will (1) review forefront areas of AMO science and highlight notable
              topics that have come to fruition since the 1994 report; (2) identify
              connections among AMO science, technology, and other scientific fields; (3)
              assess the major conclusions and recommendations of the 1994 report in light of
              recent changes in the research environment and support structure; and (4)
              identify new opportunities and challenges for AMO science.
