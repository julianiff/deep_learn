Abstract    :
              This research seeks to develop and apply recent advances in algorithmic methods
              for the construction of real time space-variant active vision systems.  The
              term space-variant refers to sensor architectures in which pixel size, and
              possibly neighborhood topology, vary with position. Although inspired by
              biological vision (e.g. foveal vision, and its cortical expression in terms of
              the log-polar mapping) , space-variant architectures form a natural synergy
              with active vision: movement of the fixation point of a sensor, either via
              electronic pan-scroll, or via robotic actuators, is mandatory for space-variant
              systems. Since it has been shown that log-polar architecture can provide a form
              of data reduction that is on the order of two to three orders of magnitude for
              current computer vision systems, there is an important niche for application of
              space-variant imaging in robotic and computer vision.  During the past year, an
              extension of the 2D Fourier Transform to log-polar image formats (the
              exponential chirp transform) has been developed. This transform has been
              demonstrated to provide the analog of a full-field (space-variant) 2D Fourier
              Transform at real-time rates on standard PC platforms.  The goal of this
              research is to apply the exponential chirp transform to develop applications in
              the areas of real-time image tracking, template matching for recognition and
              motion de-blur, and to provide demonstrations indicating the achievement of
              complex visual functionality with minimal hardware and software complexity, for
              application on small, lightweight, and mobile active vision systems.
