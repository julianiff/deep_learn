A symposium entitled Rational Synthesis of Solid-State
              Materials will be held as part of the South East Regional Meeting of the
              American Chemical Society to address the arsenal of tools now available for the
              rational synthesis of materials and to demonstrate past synthetic successes,
              provide the challenge of current target materials, and provide emphasis on
              topics related to training the next generation of scientists in this area. 
              This meeting is in response to recommendations that appear in the 1988
              PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP ON THE PRESENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF
              SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS, and in particular to "a long term goal in
              synthesis in solid state chemistry to make materials by design: e.g. to make
              what is wanted instead of seeing what can be made."  NSF will support two
              female invited speakers, and 10 grants to facilitate the participation of
              graduate students, postdocs, and/or junior faculty.

The rapidly emerging
              and changing field of solid-state chemistry and materials has undergone
              explosive growth over the past decade both in academic and industrial
              labsoratories.  Part of this trend is due to the discovery of new materials
              with important technoligical applications.
