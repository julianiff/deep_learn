Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9812850  ROSE    The University of Arizona Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Microcontamination Control is becoming
              a multi-university I/UCRC with the addition of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
              (RPI).  The Center's research addresses contamination reduction in processes
              used to manufacture semiconductor chips.  Meeting the announcement for
              competitive renewal and NSF Announcement 97-164, the RPI research site is
              expanding the Center's research agenda with significantly new intellectual
              substance through research addressing processes used in the manufacture of the
              upper layers of silicon devices and the relationship between contaminants and
              killer defects that reduce manufacturing yield.     The research agenda of the
              new site will address 1.)  Defect Analysis for Improved BEOL Yield Modeling,
              2.) Control of Process-induced Particle Formation in Thin-film Plasma
              Processing, 3.) Defect Control During Chemical Mechanical Planarization, 4.)
              Post-CMP Cleaning of Copper Damascene Structures.
