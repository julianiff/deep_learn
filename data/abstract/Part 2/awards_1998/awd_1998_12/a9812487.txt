Abstract    :
              9812487  Blanton  This award is for a developmental Rural Systemic Initiative
              (RSI).  The project would conduct the regional self-study necessary for the
              first stage of an RSI.  The self-study would be under the direction of a
              Development Team that would be composed of the leadership structure and others
              who are instrumental in educational reform in the region.  The specific
              activities to be undertaken would be surveys and data gathering specifically
              related to baseline student achievement, and the degree of readiness for
              districts to engage upon systemic reform.  The ultimate product of this project
              will be a strategy for implementing systemic reform principles and practices in
              the 35 targeted districts in South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina.   
              The work will be performed by Profile Committees (PC) and Data Teams.  Each PC
              will be charged with activities addressing a Driver.  That is, one Profile
              Committee will be assigned to topics related to classroom instruction; another
              to school policies, etc.  The Data Teams, of which there would be three, would
              do the actual collection: conducting the survey, compiling the results, and
              submitting the results to the Profile Committee.  The PC will then analyze the
              results of investigations around each Driver and would submit their findings
              and their recommendations to the Development Team.
