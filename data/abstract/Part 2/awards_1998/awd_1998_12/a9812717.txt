Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to characterize degradation mechanisms in
              polymeric topcoat and finish systems used to protect steel structures and
              bridges. Analyses will include determination by positron spectroscopy on
              nano-scale defect size profiles and distributions as a function of depth from
              the top surface and from interfaces with primers and the metal surface;
              detection, quantification and identification by electron spin resonance of free
              radicals associated with photo degradation and photo-oxidative degradation as a
              function of real-time and accelerated aging; and common optical  and mechanical
              properties. Samples will be subjected  to accelerated aging in ultraviolet
              light, oxygen and elevated temperature and to actual exposure on bridges and
              other structures. The results will be combined to develop an understanding of
              the degradation mechanisms responsible for failure of coating systems on
              structural steels.
