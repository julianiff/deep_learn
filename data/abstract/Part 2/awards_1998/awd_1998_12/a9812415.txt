Abstract    :
              This project is investigating computer architectures based  on a distributed,
              decentralized (DD) approach to computing.  It is now necessary to re-examine
              traditional concepts of  processor architecture because the gap between
              processor  cycle time and relative memory access time is increasing, 
              distributing a high-speed synchronous clock to billions of  transistors is
              difficult, and as processors become more  complex and compiler analysis becomes
              more intelligent,  their interface must be improved. In this research, the 
              underlying processor model used is both distributed and  decentralized in
              resource allocation, consisting of multiple  independently programmable
              processing elements, elasticity  connected to one another and to memory via
              FIFO queues. This  approach is capable of tolerating memory latency, overcoming
               the clock distribution problem, and facilitating the  transfer of compiler
              information to the hardware. This  project includes the development of compiler
              technology and  a hierarchical simulation framework to demonstrate these 
              claims.
