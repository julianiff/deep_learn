Abstract    :
              9812820  Harris  Thin films or coatings are used as thermal barriers to 
              increase hardness in the manufacture of engine parts. It is  important to
              develop ways to nondestructively inspect such  coatings to assess their quality
              before a part is placed in  service. Analytical expressions that describe the
              time  delay, and transmission loss or attenuation of ultrasonic  waves caused
              by thinning, flaking, or cracking of the  coatings are developed. Surface waves
              are especially useful  as they sample a larger volume of the coating than do
              waves  reflected from coated surface and provide stronger received  signal. The
              work is done in collaboration with Caterpillar  Corporation.  ***
