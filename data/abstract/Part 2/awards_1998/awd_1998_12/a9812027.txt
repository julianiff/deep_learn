Abstract    :
              Abstract - Zhang      This award is to investigate the thermo-optical response
              of high temperature superconducting films at a fundamental level. 
              Understanding the mechanisms of electron-phonon interaction within the film and
              the energy transport at the film-substrate interface is crucial for many
              devices.  However, because of their complex chemical structure, these
              interactions in these films have not been fully understood.  Temperature and
              wavelength dependent radiative properties will be measured.  In addition the
              effects of film thickness and microstructure on electron scattering will also
              be examined.  The feasibility of building ultrafast radiation modulators will
              be experimentally investigated.  The results will benefit further development
              of radiation modulators, infrared detectors, and other optoelectronic devices
              which can be used for remote sensing of the ocean and the atmosphere.
