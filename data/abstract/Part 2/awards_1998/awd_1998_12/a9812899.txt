Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT
EEC-9812899  
Ward/Univ of New Mexico   

This is an Exploratory
              Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              
for Micro-Engineered Ceramics.

The objective is to explore the use of
              aerosol drying and pyrolysis to synthesize inorganic particles and particle
              coatings, which possess structured mesoporosity.  By investigating several
              particle/coating structure types, the importance of drying rate and reactor
              temperature on the structural order, porosity, and microstructural properties
              of the particles will be determined.  This project has the potential to provide
              unique structures in powder form using a scaleable single-step process.
