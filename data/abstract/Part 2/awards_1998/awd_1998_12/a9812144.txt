Penn State University will establish a resource center for
              materials science and engineering education.  The center will collect, classify
              and disseminate existing and newly developed teaching resources for the K-16
              materials education community. All forms of teaching aids, electronic, print
              and video, will be included.  The teaching resource center will be a dispersed
              center:  coordination will be centered at Penn State; collection and
              classification of materials will be coordinated by Penn State, Purdue
              University and the U. of Washington.  The classified materials will be made
              available to the teaching community through a Web site at Purdue, the site is
              developed with support from TMS and AIME.  The Web site will include a synopsis
              of the resource and information on its source and availability, with electronic
              links as appropriate.  The collection of print and video materials will be
              housed at and disseminated by Penn State, with support from the Materials
              Education Council.  Additional dissemination efforts include direct mailings
              and presentations.  The center will develop evaluation tools of the individual
              resources to be utilized by the users of the resources.

The Teaching
              Resource Center, by disseminating the existence of available teaching tools and
              thus preventing inadvertent duplication of efforts, will impact the
              effectiveness of materials education in all institutions.
