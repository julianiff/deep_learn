Abstract    :
                    Networking and Telecommunications Task Force of Educom (NTTF) and FARNET  
               The NSF vBNS program is nearing the end of its 5-year award. As is described
              in its 1997 midterm review, the vBNS is widely recognized for essential
              contributions to the development of U.S. capabilities for advanced networking
              for R&D. In its first three years of service, for example, the vBNS has:  -
              accelerated the planning and implementation of the Partnerships for Advanced
              Computational Infrastructure,   - enabled the interconnection of the Internet2
              universities and partners,  - served as the core national network for goal 2.1
              of the Next Generation Internet project,  - supported remote computing and
              collaborations for significant advances in the sciences and engineering, and  -
              led to the design and improvement of high-performance network technology in the
              commercial sector.  The vBNS expert review concluded with a very strong
              recommendation that NSF continue its support for advanced networking for
              research and development after the scheduled conclusion of the present vBNS
              award.    It is now time, therefore, to examine developments in technology and
              the environment since the vBNS program was designed and to reach sound
              recommendations on how NSF might best support its goals for the continued
              development of advanced networking in the coming years. This project intends to
              organize and oversee a formal process that captures and summarizes the best
              creative thinking of both experts and generalists in the U.S. community for
              advanced networking. The result will be a final document and supporting
              material outlining the major issues and objectives to be addressed by NSF in
              its follow-on program to the vBNS.
