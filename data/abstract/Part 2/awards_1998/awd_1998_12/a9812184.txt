              Research, Inc.  Title: Validated Radiation Model Impacts on Climate Simulations
                 The planned  work will examine the impact of an improved  data-validated
              longwave radiation package on multi-year simulations  with a GCM. Previous work
              has demonstrated that the increased  heating rate accuracy provided by the
              Rapid Radiative Transfer  Model (RRTM) modifies the temperature structure,
              water vapor  distribution and tropical circulation in a seasonal GCM
              simulation.  In addition, the important role of clouds in both longwave and 
              shortwave processes in relation to the impact of RRTM will be  investigated.
              The work is important because longer simulations are  necessary to establish
              the full climatic and dynamical consequences  of the improved longwave model
              and appropriateness of its proposed  application to the next version to the
              NCAR Community Climate Model  CCM4.
