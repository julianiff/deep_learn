Abstract    :
              This project addresses the need to upgrade the controllers of two stiff testing
              machines which were based on a 286 computer and became obsolete due to changes
              in computer hardware and software.  Additionally, the lack of manual overrides
              in the controller does not allow for operation of these machines manually. 
              Both machines will be retrofit with modern controllers, composed of state of
              the art computers and software, as well as install manual controls.  The
              structural and hydraulic components of the stiff testing machines remain
              unchanged and will allow for at least another 20 years of research and
              instructional use with these upgrades.  Both machines, which are basic tools in
              rock mechanics, have been heavily used in research, graduate instruction, and
              undergraduate instruction since their acquisition ten years ago.  The rock
              mechanics laboratory at the University of Kentucky is a regional center of
              excellence, and plays an important role for the College of Engineering, the
              Department of Mining Engineering, and the large mining industry in the state.
