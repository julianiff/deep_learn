Abstract    :
              The Cornell Biological Field Station (CBFS) serves as a  primary field site for
              aquatic research at Cornell  University.  The principal mission of the Field
              Station is  to provide facilities for long-term ecological research and  to
              support the University's educational programs, with  special emphasis on
              freshwater systems.  A master planning  effort is proposed to address future
              research/training  program development at CBFS over the next five years.  The 
              primary goal of the proposed planning effort will be to  broaden the research
              and training program at CBFS to an  expanded user community.  The planning
              exercise will be a  workshop format and will focus on four objectives: 1) 
              identify new research directions that will add breadth and  strength to the
              existing research program 2) develop  strategies to facilities cross-site
              comparisons with the  long-term Oneida Lake data set, and 3) identify ways to 
              enhance the education/training mission of the field Station  and 4) prioritize
              facility improvements and equipment  needs associated with a strategic plan and
              panel  recommendations.
