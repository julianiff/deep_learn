Abstract    :
                Causal knowledge makes up much of what we know and want to know in science.
              The goal of this   research is to develop and apply a unified method for
              representing and discovering causal relationships   from a mixture of
              observational and experimental data. Probabilistic causal networks are being
              used as a   representation of causality. Bayesian methods are being applied to
              learn probabilistic causal networks   from data. A computer implementation of
              the discovery method is being investigated empirically using   data generated
              from existing causal models that were constructed by human experts. The ability
              to use a   mixture of observational and experimental data will expand
              considerably the scope of application of  Bayesian causal modeling and
              discovery in science.
