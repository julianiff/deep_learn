Abstract    :
              9812708  Kinsel  The goal of this proposed research is to study a new 
              analytical approach to examine the dynamics of surface-  biomolecule
              interactions.  This approach is that of Matrix  Assisted Laser Desorption
              Ionization  (MALDI) mass  spectrometry (MS).  This technique could enable the 
              examination of biomolecule surface adsorption at less than  monolayer coverage.
               The problem to be examined centers on  the effect of surface roughness in
              attenuating MALDI MS ion  signals.  Essentially, an inverse relationship has
              been  observed in which, given a constant amount of biomolecule  applied to a
              given polymer surface, the biomolecule MALDI  ion signal increases in intensity
              as the surface-biomolecule  binding affinity decreases.  These studies,
              together with  studies of the effect of changes in various surface  properties
              on biomolecule adsorption and studies of the time  dependence of biomolecule
              adsorption, promise to provide new  insights into the fundamental processes
              which influence  surface-biomolecule interactions.  ***
