Abstract    :
              9812789    The proposed instrumentation project requests funds to design, test,
              and prototype 24-bit analog to digital converters (ADC)s for use in the
              seafloor data loggers currently operated by SIO. The PI has previously
              developed a 16-bit ADC that is used in 47 seafloor data recorders. These
              instruments have been successfully deployed both for long duration and for
              large arrays. However, a 24-bit structure for the ADC would greatly improve the
              system. Advantages of an oversampling 24-bit system include the fact that
              post-sensor amplification is often not required, the need to carefully match
              filtering and amplication to the local noise environment is avoided, and the
              increased resolution allows researchers to avoid using complex engineering
              solutions like gain ranging. The PI's feel that a carefully designed 24-bit
              system will greatly enhance the quality and quantity of data returned from
              deployments of these instruments. The proposal includes matching funds from AOA
              Geophysics, Inc.
