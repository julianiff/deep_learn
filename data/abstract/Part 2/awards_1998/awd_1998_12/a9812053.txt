Abstract    :
              This is an experimental study of emotion in social interaction. It attempts to
              (1) delineate the cognitive mediation of the influence of affect on integrative
              bargaining, (2) offer an explicit theory specifying this cognitive mediation,
              and (3) provide an experimental test of the hypotheses concerning the role of
              affect in integrative bargaining. Positive affect is predicted to increase the
              subjective probability assessment of a mutually beneficial agreement, which in
              turn will increase the actor's level of aspiration. Similarly, positive affect
              will increase trust, and trust and level of aspiration will combine to increase
              the likelihood of achieving integrative solutions. These predictions would be
              tested by an experiment in which affect is manipulated (positive, neutral, and
              negative), the proposed intervening cognitions are assessed, and the effects
              observed in the outcomes of a bargaining task. The key dependent variable is
              the degree to which the bargaining outcomes are integrative, that is the extent
              to which they provide high joint profit.     This pilot study will serve as a
              starting point for further work focussing on the implications of structural and
              situational sources of affect, relevant self processes, and the interactional
              nature of negotiation.
