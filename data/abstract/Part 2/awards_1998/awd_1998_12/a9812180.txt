Abstract    :
              Mark Ratner of Northwestern University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop,
              test, and apply theoretical methods for (1) interpreting charge transfer
              processes in molecular wires and intramolecular electron transfer systems, (2)
              the general irreversible quantum dynamics of subsystems coupled to dissipative
              bath structures, and (3) generalized coupled mode systems.  Smaller efforts
              will be made on development and testing of ab initio electronic structure
              techniques for transition-metal-containing molecules including relativistic and
              correlation corrections, and on relaxation in glassy systems.

The common
              thread linking all of these is use of appropriate theoretical methods for
              interpretation of experiment.  In the case of intramolecular electron transfer
              and molecular wire structures, principal interest will lie in the onset of
              dissipative behavior and in the applicability of rate laws.  Predictions of the
              transition from coherent to incoherent transfer will be important for
              understanding molecular wire interconnects, and the elasticity of charge
              transport in molecular wire structures.
