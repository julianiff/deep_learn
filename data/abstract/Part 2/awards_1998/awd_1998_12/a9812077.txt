              Title: Kr-Ar-Xe Gravitational Separation Temperatures in GISP2 Ice:
              Correlations with Oxygen-18 and Borehole Measurements    This SGER award
              supports the measurement of Kr/Ar and Xe/Ar ratios in 20 samples of gases
              trapped in ice from the GISP2 ice-core, Greenland.  This method derives
              paleotemperature  from the gravitational enrichment of these noble gas ratios
              relative to the atmosphere.  The proposed measurements will validate
              paleotemperature measurements derived  from other methods.  The project is
              aimed at developing, testing, and applying this new approach as an independent
              test of paleotemperature analysis.  The method will extend the noble gas method
              to cover the full range of ice recovery (to 110,000 years) and will complete
              the Kr/Ar record to 40,000 years.  If successful, this method should open the
              way for a variety of applications in paleoclimate inference and more secure
              model testing.
