This three-year award supports US-Greek collaborative research
              in the area of transition metal silicides between Madhu Menon of the University
              of Kentucky and Antonis Andriotis of the Foundation for Research and Technology
              - Hellas (FORTH) in Heraklion, Crete.  The objectives of their research are to
              study structure and stabilities of devices based on transition metals and their
              silicides with a view to fabricating Schottky barrier devices; and to study Ge
              based clathrates. This project will establish a pilot program for international
              cooperation in computational materials sciences.  

The US investigators
              bring to this collaboration strengths in new computational techniques for
              calculating dynamic properties of semiconductor clusters and solids.  This is
              complemented by the Greek experience in the understanding of the behavior of
              transition metals systems.
