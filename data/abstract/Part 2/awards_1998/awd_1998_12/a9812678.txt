Abstract    :
              The coupling mechanisms of the solar wind to the magnetosphere and thence to the
              ionosphere are one of the primary problems in space physics today.  The
              research program proposed here will examine this topic by using a very
              sophisticated computer model, which is being developed my mission Research
              Corporation.  The model, referred to as the integrated Space Weather prediction
              model (ISM), used MHD global simulations to simulate the solar
              wind-magnetosphere system.  it also can use a physics based ionospheric model
              to control the coupling of the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.  The specific
              topics which will be investigated under this proposal include the mechanism by
              which plasma from the solar wind gains entry to the magnetosphere, and the
              macroscale properties of the dayside merging line and associated structures
              such as the plasma mantle and weak magnetic field regions (the "magnetospheric
              sash"0)
