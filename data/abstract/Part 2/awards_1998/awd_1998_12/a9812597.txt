Cosmic rays have been observed up to energies in excess of
              10^20 eV. It is not at all clear how these particles are accelerated up to such
              energies, since standard acceleration scenarios have difficulties above about
              10^15 eV or so. It is clear, though, that the sources of these extremely high
              energy cosmic rays must be nearby. Otherwise interactions with the microwave
              background will degrade the particle energies, and there by prevent them from
              getting to us from distant sources. The Auger experiment is designed to study
              these highest energy particles. Auger would be the first air shower array large
              enough (9000 km^2-sr) to detect a reasonable number of 10^20 eV events, and it
              may have sufficient angular resolution to trace them back to their sources in
              the sky.  This proposal will aid in the Auger project development through
              simulations, prototype installation and necessary activities leading to
              formation of the international collaboration.
