Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9812412  Ignacio Grossmann/Carnegie Mellon U.    This project
              supports a planning meeting for the "US/South American Chemical Engineering
              Research and Education Workshop" to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on April
              8-9, 1998.  Co-chairs from Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the U. S. will develop
              a theme, an agenda, a list of potential participants and topics, and a
              preliminary schedule and time frame for the Workshop.    Four individuals from
              the U.S.A and possibly two from South America are to be supported to attend the
              chemical engineering workshop planning meeting.  The co-chairs will prepare a
              planning report that will be communicated to the authorities of the four
              participating countries which will be used in developing the Fall Workshop. 
              The Fall Workshop may be held early in 1999, possibly in Rio de Janeiro.
