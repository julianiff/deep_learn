Abstract    :
              This project (named Chinook) seeks to develop appropriate  abstractions for
              embedded system development, design,  implementation, and validation that will
              enhance  retargetability and shorten the design cycle. The  abstractions will
              be provide leverage in automatically  synthesizing the most labor intensive and
              error-prone  elements of embedded software that lead to the great  majority of
              errors and hamper design space exploration. The  project is vertically
              integrated, that is, a range of tools  and methods to support high-level
              specification, simulation,  communication synthesis, operating system
              customization and  optimization, and debugging and verification. Specific 
              activities include: (1) development of a composition  methodology for
              control-dominated systems, (2) communication  and synchronization code
              synthesis including buffering and  protocol specialization, and (3) debugging,
              verification,  and visualization tools for embedded system design.
