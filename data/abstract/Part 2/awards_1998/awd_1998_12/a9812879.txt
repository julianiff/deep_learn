Abstract    :
              9812879  Sinskey  The objective of this conference is to provide a consensus
              definition of the goals and principles of Metabolic Engineering.  The first
              Engineering Foundation conference that emphasize Metabolic Engineering was
              entitled "Recombinant DNA Biotechnology: Focus on Metabolic Engineering" and
              was held from October 6-11, 1996, in Danvers, MA.  An international group of
              chemical engineers, computational scientists, molecular biologists and
              biochemists met to address a number of important issues regarding the emergence
              of the field of metabolic engineering.  The conference was very well attended
              by an international group representing industry, academia and government.  The
              organizing committee recommended that a second conference entitled Metabolic
              Engineering II (ME II) be held in Europe two years later.  ME II is scheduled
              for October 25-30, 1998, at Schloss Elmau/Oberbayern (Bavaria), Germany.  A key
              objective of ME II will be an attempt to clarify the main differences of
              metabolic engineering from other established fields and also to provide the
              unique perspectives which are explored by this new area of research.  An
              important aspect here is understanding the factors and mechanisms contributing
              to the control of flux through metabolic pathways.  Specifically, sessions on
              the following topics have been planed: (1) experimental and computational
              tools, (2) metabolic engineering for production of pharmaceuticals, fuels and
              chemicals, (3) use of metabolic engineering in the synthesis of materials, (4)
              metabolic engineering in plant systems, (5) role of metabolic engineering in
              the production of proteins, (6) evolutionary strategies for strain improvement
              via metabolic engineering, (7) medical applications and gene therapy, (8)
              higher-level metabolic engineering through regulatory genes, (9) use of
              metabolic engineering for environmental problems, and (10) future directions.
