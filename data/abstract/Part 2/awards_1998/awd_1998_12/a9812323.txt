This one-year award will support US participation in a
              US-France project development workshop to take place in Sophia Antipolis,
              France, July 1999.  The project involves US and French research teams in
              stochastic networks and operations research led by Richard Serfozo of the
              Georgia Institute of Technology and Francois Bacelli of the French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics, Sophia
              Antipolis, France.   They will discuss stochastic network models aimed at
              addressing operational issues in telecommunications, computer and manufacturing
              systems.  This will include problems concerning instabilities and rare events
              in networks, designing algorithms for parallel simulations of networks. The
              ultimate objective is to identify one or two overlapping research topics for
              future collaboration.
