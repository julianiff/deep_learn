Abstract    :
              Melville  The turbulence and mixing in the first few meters of the  mixed layer
              (the surface  wave layer) as well as their relation to wave breaking and  to
              transport by  Langmuir circulation will investigated in a series of field 
              experiment off the  California coast. The measurements will be made from a
              light  weight buoy  system measuring winds, waves, air temperature, and
              vertical  arrays of acoustic  instruments in the water to measure turbulent
              kinetic  energy, dissipation and  bubble entrainment. Conductivity sensors will
              be used very  close to the surface  to measure high void fractions. A surface
              scanning Acoustic  Doppler Profiler will  be used to characterize the Langmuir
              circulations. Models of  dissipation due to  breaking and of turbulence in the
              surface wave layer will be  tested against the  observations.
