Abstract    :
              Aagaard/Swift  The interannual variability of water properties in the  Arctic
              Ocean will be investigated with a carefully defined  statistical reduction of
              the data set used to prepare the  multi-year gridded fields recently released
              under the Gore-  Chernomyrdin environmental bilateral agreement. The 
              statistical work will be conducted in collaboration with  Russian colleagues at
              the Arctic and Antarctic Research  Institute in St Petersburg. The purpose of
              the work is: (1)  to carefully examine the Arctic Ocean temperature field from 
              the various basins on a year-to-year basin; (2) to  relate the fluctuations to
              changes in atmospheric forcing in  the source regions; and (3) to test the
              hypothesis that  the Arctic Ocean fluctuations are correlated with the North 
              Atlantic Oscillation.
