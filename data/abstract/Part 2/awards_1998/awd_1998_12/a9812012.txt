Abstract    :
               Computers are getting faster, but users' ability to exchange information with
              them is a major bottleneck.  Applications requiring three-dimensional spatial
              input, including CAD/CAM, medical visualization, weather visualization, and
              simulation & training, need better ways to allow humans to interact with them. 
              This research will develop "beyond the keyboard & mouse" interfaces to spatial
              tasks through the use of: 1) both hands in combination with voice input, 2)
              using one hand relative to the other in free-space, 3) using hand-held "prop"
              input devices used in 3d space.  This work will use helmet-based virtual
              reality (VR) systems as a research workbench.  It is unlikely that VR hardware
              will be widely used, but this approach forces designers to think "beyond the
              desktop." New interface techniques developed with this approach will then be
              adapted to a more traditional desktop setting, continuing to use physical props
              and head tracking and/or stereo glasses.  While this work will develop a number
              of specific interaction techniques, the real goal of the research is to develop
              a set of general design principles for spatial tasks, much as there is now a
              well-understood set of design rules for 2D "desktop" interface design.
