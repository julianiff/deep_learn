Abstract    :
              Floodwaters devastate billions of dollars of property and claim thousands of
              innocent lives each year.  This project is aimed at reducing the damage caused
              by floodwaters as a result of utilizing geotextile tubes to construct flood
              protection barriers.  Geotextile tubes can be constructed rapidly with less
              than sandbags.  However, there is little information regarding the proper
              design of a flood control barrier using geotextile tubes, an emerging
              technology, which has not been fully investigated.

The following tasks will
              be conducted in this project: (1) Centrifuge experimental verification of a
              numerical model that predicts the shape and stress caused by filling geotextile
              tubes, (2) Analytical assessment of the stability of dikes, (3) To develop
              filtration criteria to optimize the selection of a geotextile tube that will
              drain water rapidly while retaining the soil particles inside, and (4) To
              develop rational design method for geotextile tubes used as flood control
              barriers will be developed.
