              Science

The Association for Computing Machinery Committee on women in
              computing proposes to conduct a 1-year project to study the shrinking pipeline
              for women in computer science.  The project will achieve three objectives: (i)
              it will provide a public repository and clearing house for information and
              research pertaining to women in computing, (ii) it will raise the computing
              community's consciousness of issues relating to women in computing through the
              information published on the Web site and the dissemination of the final
              project, and (iii) it will provide an analysis of the current state of research
              and projects, and, based on this analysis, provide an understanding of future
              directives for research and projects that will increase the numbers of women in
              computing and make computer science environments more women friendly.
