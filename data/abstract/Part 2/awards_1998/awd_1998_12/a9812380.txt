Abstract    :
              
Professor William J. Thomson, of Washington State University, will continue
              prior research to develop the stability and selectivity of perovskite membranes
              for the oxidative coupling of methane. This research is warranted because the
              efficient conversion of methane can lead to a chemical industry based upon
              natural gas. The La, Sr, Co, Fe-perovskite membrane will be evaluated for
              stability and activity under low concentration of oxygen. To increase the
              membrane activity, the perovskite will be partially reduced, or it will be
              coated with standard Sm, Y, Ba, Li-doped MgO catalyst. The selectivity will be
              managed by means of the low concentration of oxygen afforded by the ionic
              conductivity of the perovskite. The kinetics of reaction will be measured under
              high pressure in an in-situ XRD cell, coupled with gas-phase analysis. The
              necessary characterization of solid and surface will be performed by
              collaborators at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This grant is given by
              the Kinetics, Catalysis and Molecular Processes program.
