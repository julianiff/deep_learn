Abstract    :
              The investigator continues research the dissociative recombination (DR) rate
              coefficients for vibrationally and rotationally excited nitrogen.  In
              calculating the DR cross section and rate coefficient, he includes molecular
              rotation.  In addition, he calculates the quantum yields of nitrogen atoms in
              ground and excited states as a function of ion vibrational level, rotational
              level and electron temperature.  Finally, using derivative couplings calculated
              under previous research, he derives diabatic potential curves and electronic
              couplings, to solve vibrational wave functions of the dissociative states and
              determining quantum yields.
