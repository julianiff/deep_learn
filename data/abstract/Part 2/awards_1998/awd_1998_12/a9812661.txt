Abstract    :
              9812661  McCarthy  This award will be used to conduct a regional self-study
              necessary for the first stage of the Rural Systemic Initiative (RSI).  The
              development phase has the following objectives:  (1) form university/school
              coalitions to evaluate the status of math and science education that is
              currently practiced and to help build support and understanding for a systemic
              approach to improving that practice; (2) Conduct a self-study  and baseline
              after establishing the extent and nature of each coalition (e.g., which schools
              involved, membership of teams), the demographics, and instructional practice;
              as well as student achievement, priorities of participating schools; (3)
              identify the local resources that need to be converged and aligned; (4) build a
              regional educational network; (5) engage the community; and (6) develop a
              strategy of reform and a plan for implementation.
