Abstract    :
              The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will  administer a
              travel grant program for approximately 80 U.S.  mathematicians to attend the
              International Conference on Industrial  and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 99), to
              be held on July 5-9, 1999 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
     
ICIAM 99 is the third
              quadrennial International Conference on  Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
              The ICIAM conferences have  demonstrated that applied and computational
              mathematics are global  enterprises with significant impact on technology and
              economic development. They are a cooperative effort of applied mathematics
              societies worldwide.
     
Applications for support will be evaluated by a
              panel of senior applied mathematicians. The panel will make every attempt to
              ensure that graduate students, young faculty, women, and minorities receive
              awards.
