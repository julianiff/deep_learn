Abstract    :
              9812777  Yang  An "International Conference on Mechanics in Medicine and
              Biology" was held in Honolulu, Hawaii, March 2-5, 1998. The meeting was the
              10th of a highly successful series of specialized international assemblies that
              began in 1978 in Aachen, Germany.  The United States hosted 3 of the 10
              conferences, which serve as an important forum for the exchange of information
              about recent developments in mechanics and medicine. Participants are from
              biomedical engineering, the life sciences, and medicine.

The 10th meeting
              included some 87 presentations in 24 sessions encompassing a wide range of
              topics at the forefront of biomechanical engineering. Presentations in areas of
              importance to National Science Foundation program objectives included
              biomaterials, biotechnology, bone structure, cardiac mechanics, imaging,
              implant design, rehabilitation, and tissue mechanics. A number of young
              investigators attended the conference.

The conference proceedings are to be
              made available to a wide audience through BITNET, which is the major
              distributor of information about biomedical engineering using the
              Internet.
