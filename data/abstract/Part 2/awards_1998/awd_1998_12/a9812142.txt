Abstract    :
              Scientific Work Experience Programs for Teachers (SWEPTs) are laboratory-based
              training programs run in industry, university or government R&D settings. 
              There are 72 SWEPTs currently existing in 34 states, with estimated annual
              expenditures between $11-15 million.  However, there is limited evaluation data
              on the impact of SWEPTs and virtually no student outcome data.

This project
              will follow the participants and their students of 8 SWEPT programs over 4
              years (approximately 70 teacher and 140 classes). A comparable set of teachers
              and their students from the same schools will similarly be studied.  Student
              performance will be determined through a common set of achievement measures
              created specifically for this study from the National Assessment of Education
              Progress instruments.  Student attitude and classroom experience data will also
              be collected.  Teacher data will include biographical information and classroom
              practices.  Pre-post data will be collected each year of the study from both
              teachers and students.  

The study will be overseen by Dr. Silverstein at
              Columbia University for the 8 SWEPTs but the study will be carried out by
              Westat, Inc.  The first year of this four-year study will be devoted to
              completing implementation arrangements.
