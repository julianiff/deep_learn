Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  SADEGHI  EEC-9812689      This planning award funds Purdue University
              to hold an Industry/University meeting to determine the feasibility and
              economic viability of becoming a part of the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Engineering Tribology.  Purdue University in exploring the
              possibility of becoming the third research site with Northwestern University
              and Georgia Institute of Technology in the already established Center.   
              Purdue University researchers plan to expand the current Center's research base
              with projects addressing:    1. Micro-electro-Mechanical-Sensors for
              Tribological Applications  2. Experimental and Analytical Investigation of
              Boundary Lubricated Contacts  3. Noise and Vibration in Grease Lubricated
              Bearing Contact   4. Spall Initiation and Propagation in Lubricated Contacts 
              5. Friction, Wear and Lubrication of Polymeric Materials
