              Change      Abstract:  The project provides the structure, tools, and ongoing
              support  for a web-based, interactive electronic community, LSC-Net.  The 
              target groups are the staff members and other stake holders in  the LSC
              projects of all types, math or science, elementary or  secondary.  TERC
              facilitates and monitors the interactions as  well as provides technical
              support. LSC-Net provides an  updatable, searchable database of all LSC
              projects and senior  staff.  In addition, LSC-Net augments the yearly Principal
               Investigator/Evaluator meetings by collaborating with Merck  Institute for
              Science Education and Horizon Research, Inc. to  provide preconference,
              conference, and post-conference  activities.  The objectives of this project
              are to increase communication and  collaboration within LSC projects and
              between LSC projects, to  provide the structure and facilitation for LSC
              projects to record  and share best practices, called nuggets, as they emerge,
              to  enrich and the expand yearly PI/evaluator meeting, and to provide  a
              mechanism for new LSCs to learn from "older" LSCs.  Cost sharing is 1%.
