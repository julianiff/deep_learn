Abstract    :
              Because of advances in commodity processors and networking  technology, parallel
              computing platforms can now consist of  cheap, commodity-designed symmetric
              multiprocessors (SMPs)  as well as clusters of SMPs, workstations, and PCs.
              This  research addresses methods to analyze, organize and schedule  computing
              in such clusters which may be connected by a fast  system-area network.
              Research activities being carried out  include: (1) Designing and developing
              analytical and  experimental performance models and tools to quantitatively 
              guide application users and computer architects to optimize  design decisions
              for a given budget, and a given class of  application programs. Focus is on
              constructing a new  cluster, upgrading an existing cluster, and designing a 
              memory hierarchy of a cluster. 2) Developing and  implementing both static and
              dynamic scheduling schemes, as  well as aiming at coordinating parallel tasks
              for load  balancing and effectively using heterogeneous workstation  resources.
              (3) Integrating the performance prediction models  and scheduling schemes into
              a visualization environment.
