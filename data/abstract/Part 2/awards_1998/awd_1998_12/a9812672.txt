Abstract    :
              9812672  Reid    The National Academy of Engineering, responding to a request
              from the   President's National Economic Council proposes  holding a 11/2 day
              workshop to   study the advisability of using government sponsored prizes as a
              way of inducing  and simulating technological innovations of significant
              societal impact.    History has several examples of the offering of a
              substantial prize leading to   important and needed technological advances. For
              example, the chronometer,   essential to  accurate navigation was developed
              this way in the 18th century.    More recent examples can also be found,  
              Current Federal procurement rules do   not allow this practice.      The
              workshop is to examine the usefulness of this practice and the conditions  
              under which it might be used effectively.
