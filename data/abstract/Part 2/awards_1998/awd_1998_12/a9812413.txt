Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project focuses on the current struggle over
              American racial classifications. The "color line," once so clearly and
              indelibly drawn by the one-drop rule, is being redrawn by a putative
              multiracial community. We argue that this movement is comprised of multiple
              strands of action, oriented toward self-expression, family and state. Three
              issues in particular will be addressed: 1) the social conditions leading to the
              formation of the "multiracial movement", 2) whether or not a collective
              multiracial consciousness is developing, and 3) the motivations behind this
              activism. Hypotheses drawn from the insights of social movement research
              predict that the multiracial movement has emerged through the convergence of
              three critical factors: 1) political opportunities that have allowed agents to
              gain access to the political sphere, 2) an organizational base that allows
              groups to take advantage of those opportunities, and 3) framings of the
              experience of multiraciality that encourage more organization around the
              issue.	Data will consist of a combination of interviews with the founders,
              leaders, and a sample of membership from multiracial organizations; archival
              research, demographic data, and fieldwork at events sponsored by multiracial
              organization. The study will provide needed systematic analysis of multiracial
              movement where none exists to date.
