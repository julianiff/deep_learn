              ABSTRACT
EEC-9812706
Pearlman

The analog technology of television is in the
              process of changing to the recently approved FCC High Definition Television
              Standard which is digital.  Although digital video is now beginning to be
              implemented, research is necessary to enhance and broaden the current
              capability.  Since it is a significant and integral part of the many new 
              communication technologies, other image transmission technologies are being
              similarly impacted by the transition from analog to digital.   To determine the
              feasibility and viability of a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center (I/IRCR) for Digital Video and Media Research to address this
              broad area, two planning grants were awarded.  Initially one was awarded to
              Rensselaer Polytechnics Institute (RPI) for an I/UCRC for Digital Video (EEC
              9615143).  Subsequently a planning grant was awarded to the New Jersey
              Institute of technology (NJIT) and Princeton University (EEC-9711581) expanding
              the Center's research to Digital Video and Media Research.

This new
              multi-university I/UCRC for Digital Video and Media Research meets the criteria
              for the I/UCRC program. 

The scope of research of this center will encompass
              the creation, design, delivery, utilization, and fabrication of digital video
              and media systems.  Areas of research will address digital image, video and
              audio processing; communications-wireless and cable; networking and high speed
              switching; creation and integration of media and multimedia; digital archiving
              and retrieval; and VLSI architectures and fabrication.
