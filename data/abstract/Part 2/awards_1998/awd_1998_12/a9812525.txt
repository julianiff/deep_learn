Implantable antitachycardia devices (ICDs) have achieved
              overwhelming success in salvaging thousands of lives by providing immediate
              electrical therapy for the treatment of potentially lethal arrhythmias, i.e.,
              ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.  These rhythms are
              believed responsible for over 80% of cases of sudden cardiac death, which
              claims 400,000 victims per year.  The number of implants of  ICDs is
              exceptional, over 100,000 implants to date, despite its relative infancy in the
              medical field.  A large remaining problem to be solved in ICD technology is
              refinement of detection criteria such that the device no longer offers a simple
              brute force solution (if in question, shock).  This is a three-fold problem:
              false shocks are an unnecessary patient distress; false shocks deplete battery
              power rendering the device less capable of addressing true urgencies and
              forcing premature explantation; and false shocks (or antitachycardia pacing)
              can initiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) when
              none previously existed.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) to
              develop new signal processing techniques and pattern recognition schemes for
              accurate arrhythmia detection which exploit the present state of technology in
              ICDs;  2) to design improved diagnostic distinction between ventricular
              tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation which capitalize on the unique
              therapeutic choices for conversion of these arrhythmias; and 3) to refine
              methods of dual-chamber analysis for application to ICD arrhythmia diagnosis. 
              Improved detection schemes comprise an engineering problem which must be
              addressed by modern digital signal processing techniques and imaginative
              engineering solutions employing concepts of lead-field theory and novel pattern
              recognition ideas.
