Abstract    :
              The "team concept" in modern organizations is a strategy designed to increase
              managerial control over workers. Traditionally it has been resisted by labor
              unions. The question to be addressed in this doctoral dissertation research
              concerns why so many American workers would prefer the implementation of this
              managerial approach. Despite numerous studies on the team concept, to date none
              has answered this question adequately. Given the prevalence and accelerating
              rate of organizational change in an era of union decline and economic
              restructuring, answering this question is both timely and relevant to ongoing
              sociological debates about the nature of current labor process innovations.
              This research will employ a unique team-level analysis to examine the meaning
              of team-based production for U. S. auto workers at the General Motors (GM)
              truck plant in Shreveport, Louisiana. Findings from this organizational
              analysis will be complemented by an historical analysis of bargaining over the
              team concept at the plant. GM-Shreveport was the first team concept plant in
              U.S. auto assembly production and has played an important role in the diffusion
              of organizational innovations in the industry. No study has yet examined the
              development of the team concept at this historically significant facility, and
              the results of this research should fill a void in our understanding of labor
              relations.
