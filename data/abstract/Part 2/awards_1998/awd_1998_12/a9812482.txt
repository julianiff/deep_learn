Abstract    :
              Under this grant from the Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the National Research Council's Board on
              Science, Technology, and Economic Policy will conduct a broad study designed to
              identify and address the key issues associated with public-private
              collaboration in the development of pre-competitive technologies.  In order to
              guide the study, a steering group of senior executives from industry and
              academic experts has been established.

The study will be comprised of a
              series of events of varying size and scope (e.g., symposia, workshops, and
              conferences), as determined by the PI and steering group.  A variety of
              pertinent issues will be addressed, including the underlying rationale for
              industry-university-government cooperation, best practices for implementing
              partnerships, means of evaluation, and experiences with international
              partnerships.

Dissemination of findings and conclusions is a high priority
              and will be pursued through various mechanisms.
