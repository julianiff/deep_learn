Abstract    :
              Shared mental models of goals, tasks, group, and the environment allow members
              of work groups to coordinate with reduced communication, to effectively handle
              cognitive overload, and, hence, to perform more effectively. This research
              investigates the development of shared mental models, the tradeoffs between
              shared models and cognitive overload, and the effects of shared models on team
              coordination and performance. It also examines whether computer-based tools for
              communication and situational awareness can help teams develop useful shared
              models without increasing cognitive overload. The research studies teams both
              in realistic, multi-week, business simulations and in short-term laboratory
              studies with tighter control. The simulation studies examine the impact of
              communication and cognitive overload on the development of shared models. The
              laboratory studies systematically manipulate the overlap between team members'
              models to examine effects on performance. This research provides basic
              knowledge about how teams operate, with strong implications for the technology
              needed to support them. In addition, the research is developing robust
              techniques for measuring mental models, which can be used by others for system
              development and evaluation. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kraut/mental.models
