Dan Farcasiu/University of Pittsburgh

Professor Dan
              Farcasiu will continue investigation of the catalytic properties and
              characterization of acid catalysts, particularly solid Lewis acids.  In
              previous research, he has developed a 13C NMR methods (the one-parameter
              method) for the practical determination of solid acidity (especially of the
              Broensted type) and he has studied the mechanism of organic reactions of
              fundamental and industrial importance.  The first goal of the present grant is
              the development of a new method to investigate the properties of solid and
              liquid acids, particularly of the Lewis type, utilizing 13C NMR of
              acid-complexed ethers.  The second goal is the evaluation of Broensted acidity
              of solid acids over a wide range of temperature to identify the role of that
              type of sites in the mechanism of isomerization and cracking of hydrocarbons. 
              The third goal is to study the mechanisms of low-temperature isomerization and
              cracking of saturated hydrocarbons over zeolites, heteropolyacids, and sulfated
              zirconia, in comparison with trifluioremethysulfonic acid, a weak superacid. 
              The grant will support the training of graduate students.
