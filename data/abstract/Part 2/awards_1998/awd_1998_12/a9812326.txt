This three-year award will support US-Netherlands cooperative
              research between Robert Thorne and Joel Brock of Cornell University and Herve
              S.J. van der Zant at the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands.  The
              objective of the collaboration is to develop the enabling technologies for
              study of mesoscale structures and heterostructures involving charge-density
              wave (CDW) conductors.  The collaboration will focus on preparing high-quality
              thin films of the CDW conductors NbSe3 and Rb0.3MoO3, on developing patterning
              techniques, and on preparing heterostructures.

This collaboration will merge
              the Delft's group's expertise in CDW film growth and general mesoscopic physics
              with the Cornell group's complementary expertise in growth and properties of
              CDW conductors.
