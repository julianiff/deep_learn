This project, sponsored by San Diego State University, will
              develop an inquiry-based, computer-supported, physical science course for the
              Middle School. The course, when completed, will cover the topics of properties
              and changes in the properties of matter, the structure of matter, motion and
              forces and the transfer of energy. The approach will be consistent with the
              National Standards and include the unifying themes of systems, models,
              constancy and change and equilibrium, the nature of science, the history of
              science and social issues related to science. The program will also make
              connections with mathematics as suggested by the NCTM Standards. The project
              will develop software that extends the activities of the prior work supported
              under the project called Constructing Physics Understanding in a
              Computer-supported Learning Environment. It will consist of six units: 
              Applications and Systems and Interactions in (1) Systems and Energy, (2) Light
              and Color, (3) Sound, Electricity and Magnetism, (4) Motion and Forces, (5)
              Physical Changes, and (6) Chemical Changes. Each unit will be developed using
              the learning cycle approach supported by the software.
