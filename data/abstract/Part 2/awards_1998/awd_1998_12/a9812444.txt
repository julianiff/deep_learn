Abstract    :
                    Abstract - Phillips -9812444  Prof. Jonathan Phillips has found that
              Pd/Alumina catalysts for the hydrogenation of alkenes, obtained by
              solidification of catalytic metals and oxides from plasmas, are more selective
              than the typical impregnated catalysts, at similar conversion levels.  This
              SGER will be focused on exploring the relationship between plasma-synthesized
              catalyst structure and catalytic properties, for Pd and Fe on alumina or
              carbon. The structure of the catalyst will be varied by manipulating the plasma
              operating parameters, and the characterization will be performed chemically,
              spectroscopically, calorimetrically, and with C4 and C5 reaction kinetics.
