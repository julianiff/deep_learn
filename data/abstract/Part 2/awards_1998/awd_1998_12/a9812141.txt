              administered and carefully-managed  ten-week program that places college
              students in stimulating and challenging  professional and educational roles
              within the federal sector. Utilizing an intensive  summer model, HACU and the
              sponsoring agencies and departments provide  academically qualified students
              with experience-based teaming. Student interns are  placed federal offices and
              laboratories in the. Washington, DC metropolitan area and in  field sites
              throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Student placements are based 
              upon position descriptions provided by supervisors which detail the academic 
              preparation, work experience and special skills required to perform the job.   
              This project is jointly supported by the Office of the Director, the
              Directorate for Social,  Behavioral and Economic Sciences, and the Directorate
              for Engineering.
