Abstract    :
                9812297   Okumura     The PI is organizing the Informal Conference on
              Photochemistry, which will be held in Pasadena, CA, during the period May
              10-15, 1998. This conference is organized every other year by different
              institutions. It is not affiliated with any professional organization and is
              held in a style similar to Gordon Conferences. The community typically
              attending these meetings consists of both atmospheric scientists, in particular
              laboratory researchers, and investigators involved with physical chemistry. The
              interactions between these different groups is one of the strengths of these
              meetings, where both basic and applied work is discussed. NSF support will help
              graduate students and post-docs are to attend this meeting.
