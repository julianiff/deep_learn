Abstract    :
              PI:     J.F. Reynolds and L. F. Pitelka  Institution:  Duke University  
              Proposal Number:  DEB - 9812440    There exist two generally broad categories
              of forest-growth models: gap models which deal with long-term population
              dynamics of vegetation structure and stand models, which deal with short- to
              medium-term physiological processes such as gas fluxes and plant growth.  A
              fundamental question regarding these models is how much physiology from stand
              models needs to be incorporated into gap models to effectively simulate
              long-term vegetation responses to global change. A workshop would be help to
              evaluate this question. It would assemble a range of investigators with
              experience on both types of models and employ strategies that combine model
              comparisons and model assessments.  The workshop will ensure that forest growth
              models are developed that are effective in evaluating projected changes in
              global climate and in elevated carbon dioxide concentrations.  This will
              improve the utility of forest-growth models in developing important management
              decisions.
