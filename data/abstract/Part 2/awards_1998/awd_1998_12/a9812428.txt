Abstract    :
              This award funds an NSF-US/Europe Research Planning Workshop on  Personal
              Robotics, to be held in Toulouse, France, May 14 and 15,  1998.  The workshop
              will bring together leading researchers from  the US and Europe to examine a
              new center of convergence in  robotics research, centered on "human in the
              loop" problems.  The  meeting will undertake to identify the research needed to
              improve  the connectivity of people and computers to the real physical  world. 
              This presents new challenges and opportunities for the  emergence of robotics
              as a "personal" technology.  Personal  robotics applies to robots that can
              serve people directly in  professional, domestic, human-assistance, and
              public-oriented use,  and includes new and emerging concepts such as haptic
              interfaces,  telepresence, wearable and interface robotics that enrich and 
              support the connection of people to the world.  The results and  conclusions of
              the workshop will be presented at a panel session  the following week at the
              IEEE International Conference on  Robotics and Automation in Leuven, Belgium,
              and a report will  later be posted on the World Wide Web.
