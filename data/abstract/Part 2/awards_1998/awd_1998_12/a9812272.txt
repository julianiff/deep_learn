Abstract    :
              Since the 1980's, increasing numbers of residents in Dakar, Senegal are adhering
              to conservative religious values advocated by reformist Muslim groups. Whereas
              many feminist scholars assert that such trends diminish women's rights
              throughout the Muslim world, others contend that these women exercise
              self-determination and articulate nationalist discourses through conservative
              practices. However, neither view addresses the hybrid identities Muslim women
              create to incorporate tradition and modernity in their practical lives. The
              proposed doctoral dissertation research will examine this hybridity, and
              explore how women construct discourses about gender roles in an urban Muslim
              society. The study will examine the questions: (1) Do Dakar women in reformist
              Muslim groups develop views on gender roles which build a feminist discourse,
              or do they retrench patriarchal values? (2) How do these women's discourses
              differ from those of women in more established Muslim organizations? The
              project will entail a series of focus group interviews with members of both
              populations and, participant observations at their religious meetings. Also, it
              will examine how the women's religious affiliations, ages, education levels,
              and economic and employment statuses impact their choice of organization, as
              well as their gender discourses. This demographic component will be
              supplemented with a quantitative survey. Results will shed light on how women
              construct gender roles in rapidly changing social environments.
