Abstract    :
              Tall Timbers Research Station (TTRS) was chartered in  1958 to conduct original
              research on the role of fire in  the ecology of forest environments in the
              Southeastern  Coastal Plain.  This project will enable TTRS to renovate  the
              29-year old Stoddard Research Laboratory and expand  the existing 9,416 square
              foot facility with an  additional 8,103 square feet of floor space.    Tall
              Timbers Research Station consists of 1,800 ha in  northern Leon County Florida.
               The station is located in  the midst of more than 150,000 ha of private
              hunting  plantations, most of which are available to station  scientists for
              research.  Additionally, Tall Timbers  holds a conservation and research
              easement on one of the  last remaining examples of late successional longleaf 
              pine (Pinus palustris) forest where the ground cover  vegetation has not been
              disturbed by agriculture.  While  the land resources available for research at
              TTRS are  outstanding, the Stoddard Research Laboratory, the main  research
              facility at TTRS, is outdated, overcrowded, and  no longer capable of
              supporting the research mission of  the institution.    A major objective of
              the Stoddard Lab renovation and  expansion project is to provide office and
              laboratory  space for visiting scientists.  Presently, no office or  laboratory
              space is allocated for visiting scientists at  Tall Timbers.  After this
              project is completed 1,397  square feet of office and laboratory space will be 
              available for exclusive use by visiting scientists and  students.  An
              additional 5,694 square feet of shared  space will also be available to
              visiting researchers.  The renovation and expansion will result in a net  gain
              of 4,841 square feet of office, laboratory and  storage space for visiting
              scientists who want to work  at Tall Timbers.  The renovation and expansion
              will also  provide needed space for a significant and expanding  research
              station library collection that serves not only  station and visiting
              scientists, but also provides a  computerized fire ecolo gy information service
              to fire  ecology researchers throughout the world.
