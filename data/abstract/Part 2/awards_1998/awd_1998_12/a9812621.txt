Abstract    :
              9812621  Debari  The tectonic setting of the Cascades Core remains
              controversial, particularly the manner in which the high grade rocks were
              loaded during the development of the Cretaceous arc and the associated magmatic
              events.    Several models of magmatic processes in the deep crust of
              continental arcs have been advanced, but the lack of deep crustal exposures
              have provided only limited constraints for the applicability of these models. 
              This project will focus on the structural, metamorphic, plutonic and
              geochemical processes operating in the Ten Peak pluton, which is the deepest
              exposed pluton of significant size in the Cascades Core.   Results are expected
              to clarify the role of mafic magmas in generating the pluton, to provide
              insights into deep crustal emplacement mechanisms and to allow a better
              understanding of the evolution and loading history of the Cascade arc.  .
