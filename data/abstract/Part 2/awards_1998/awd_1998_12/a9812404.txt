In this project, the PIs will study interannual variability
              of the upper ocean for the period, 1940 - 1999.  The Modular Ocean Model (MOM)
              will be used to provide "forecast" fields of Temperature, Salinity, and
              velocity fields.  Then  observations will be introduced through optimal
              interpolation or "nudging" techniques for data assimilation.  Constraints are
              various historical data sets from the National Oceanographic Data Center
              (NODC), and comparisons will be made with independent data sets including the
              data sets from the World Ocean circulation Experiment (WOCE).
The model will
              be improved by shifting to a multi-processor version,
adding different wind
              products, upgrading the assimilation algorithm to include freshwater input, and
              other refinements.  NODC scientists will focus on constructing repeat sections
              and time series, examining heat, mass, and freshwater budgets, and upgrading
              the data base with previously unavailable historical data. The NODC effort is
              supported by NOAA.
