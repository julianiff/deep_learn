     This award will provide partial support for the
              featured speakers
and also for some graduate students and other young
              mathematicians to
attend the 1999, 2000, and 2001 BEST conferences, `BEST'
              being a
deceptively lighthearted acronym for `Boise Extravaganzas in Set
              Theory,'
a series of conferences devoted to one of the oldest and deepest
              topics
in the Foundations of Mathematics.  The general format will be to
              build
each of the three-day conferences around four one-hour lectures
              by
distinguished set theorists and to round out the program with shorter
              talks
contributed by those attracted to the featured speakers.  This strategy
              has
been successful in the past---the series of conferences began in
              1992---and
participants are widely representative of set theoretic research
              across
the U.S. and Canada, with increasing participation from
              countries
overseas.  Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and
              by
underrepresented minorities has been encouraged.  The talks are held
              in
barrier free classrooms at Boise State University, and efforts are made
to
              accommodate special needs among the roughly twenty annual participants.
The
              host institution provides office support and secretarial facilities
without
              cost to the participants or to the government.
