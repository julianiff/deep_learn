              Abstract  ATM-9812384  Randall, David A.   Colorado State University  Title:
              Convective Cloud Systems in Climate Models    The PI and his team propose to
              conduct several tasks: (i) to  explore the possibility of parameterizing the
              effect of vertical  wind shear on the relationship between the cumulus kinetic
              energy  and the cumulus mass flux; (ii) to investigate the effects of 
              condensed-water loading on the Convective Available Potential  Energy (CAPE) 
              and to implement improved microphysics  parameterization in cumulus
              parameterization, to explore the  sensitivity of stratiform cloudiness to the
              microphysical   parameterization used in the cumulus parameterization; (iii) to
                implement a recently proposed downdraft parameterization and to use  it to
              explore the effects of convective downdrafts on the surface   fluxes; (iv) to
              implement a much more nearly exact and internally   consistent representation
              of moist thermodynamic processes,  including conservation of moist entropy and
              a complete energy  cycle; (v) to develop a 'next generation' version of
              stratiform  cloudiness parameterization with a prognostic cloud fraction 
              variable, distinct prognostic temperatures and water vapor mixing  ratios for
              the clear and cloudy portions of each grid cell and  distinct prognostic
              vertical velocities for the clear and cloudy  portions of each grid cell; and
              (vi) to test the stratiform cloud  and convection parameterizations in the CCM.
               The work is important  because it will enhance  understanding of the role of
              various cloud  parameterization schemes in GCM's.
