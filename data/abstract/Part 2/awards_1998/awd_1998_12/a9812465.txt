Abstract    :
              9812465  Aschheim  In this project analytical and experimental studies to
              confirm the  basic concepts and to explore the viability of various potential 
              mechanisms and the use of ordinary and castellated steel beams.   The
              analytical studies will test current hypotheses for stress  distributions and
              sizing criteria, and will explore various  attainable mechanisms under cyclic
              lateral loading with and without  gravity loads using inelastic finite element
              analyses.  These  studies will also help in defining test specimens and their 
              expected behavior.  Experimental studies will establish that shear  yielding
              can protect the beam-column connection from overstress,  and will investigate
              the deformability of the beams as limited by  material properties and
              stability.  Ordinary and castellated beams  will be tested having circular and
              hexagonal openings in the web.   Test setups will resemble those used in the
              SAC program.    Results from this research will establish the viability of the 
              proposed shear-yielding moment-resistant frame system, and will  provide an
              initial basis for establishing design criteria.  Test  results from simple
              beams suggest that the proposed steel frame  system will be cost competitive
              and possess extraordinary  ductility.  This additional performance enhancement
              of the lateral-  load resisting-system permits story heights to be reduced by
              10 to  20%, thereby achieving further economy in material and construction 
              costs.    This is a project under the first round (FY'98) competition of  joint
              CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-30 "US-Japan Cooperative Research  In Urban
              Earthquake Disaster Mitigation".  ***
