Abstract    :
                    Deliyannis, Constantine  AST  98-12735      Dr. Deliyannis will carry out
              a program of observations of open star clusters that will address a number of
              issues in stellar and chemical evolution, by tracing the behavior of the
              stellar lithium abundance.  Observations will be made with the
              Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO telescope using its multi-object spectrograph which
              can provide large samples of stars within each cluster.  A sample of up to 10
              clusters, selected to span the relevant parameter space in age and metallicity,
              will allow the investigation of : a) mechanisms for Li depletion in
              main-sequence stars, b) tests of theoretical explanations for the behavior of
              Lithium abundance with temperature, and c) the galactic evolution of Lithium
              and its relation to 'primordial' Li abundance. The research plan focuses on
              using the behavior of Lithium abundance in unevolved stars as probes of stellar
              structure and evolution, but the results would have implications for the
              determination of globular cluster ages, big bang nucleosynthesis, and
              cosmology.
