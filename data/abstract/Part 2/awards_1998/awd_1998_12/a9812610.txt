Abstract    :
              This award will support the purchase of a 750 MHz multi-  nuclear
              high-resolution NMR system primarily for the use of  the University of Michigan
              Chemistry/Biological Chemistry  NMR community.  This instrument is jointly
              funded by NSF and  NIH through the NSF/NIH Shared Instrumentation Program.  The
               instrument will be used for experiments leading to the  determination of
              high-resolution three-dimensional  structures and dynamics of proteins, nucleic
              acids, and  protein-nucleic acid complexes in solution.  The major  virtue of
              the new instrument is an improvement of at least a  factor of two in
              sensitivity as compared to currently  accessible instruments, bringing the
              structural studies of  these more difficult systems within reach.  Projects 
              benefiting from this acquisition are: structural studies of  the molecular
              chaperone proteins Hsc-70 and DnaK, structural  studies of Stromelysin and its
              complexes with inhibitors and  substrate, structural studies of proteins
              expressed by the  E. coli Ars-Operon, structural elucidation of 
              Cytidylyltransferase, design of Cysteine Protease  inhibitors, synthesis of
              improved DNA binding carbohydrates,  dynamics of DNA triple helices,
              elucidation of anti-DNA  autoantibody antigen interactions, and the structure
              of  soluble and membrane-spanning domains of the GABA receptor.
