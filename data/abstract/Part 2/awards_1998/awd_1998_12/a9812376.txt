Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will join his German colleagues at the University of
              Bremen and the University of Oldenburg in a study of the relationship between
              the oxidation of dissolved organic matter (humic substances) and cycling of
              managanese in the water column of the Wadden Sea.  The principal investigator
              plans to deploy a package of state-of-the-art in-situ sensors ("ZAPS") capable
              of measuring organic matter and managanese with high precision.  His German
              counterparts, who are also expert in marine manganese geochemistry, will deploy
              their own latest instrumentation.  Besides providing the opportunity for
              analytical cross-checking between these internationally-ranked laboratories,
              the project promises to yield detailed insight into the relationship between
              microbial processes, carbon cycling, and the chemistry of manganese (and
              possibly iron) in the surface ocean.
