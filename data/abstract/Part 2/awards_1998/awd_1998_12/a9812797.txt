Abstract    :
              Advanced networking infrastructure initiatives, such as that represented by
              NSF's vBNS or the government's Next Generation Internet initiative, are
              typically accessible in their early stages only to a small number of leading
              research institutions of higher education.  Though dissemination of results is
              an expected outcome of these initiatives, it can be extremely difficult for the
              rest of higher education, in very practical terms, to replicate the experiences
              of the early adopters and developers.  Typically, those who follow require
              information, consultation, and other services of a rather intense and
              dedicated, case-by-case type.  The intent of this proposal is to seed the
              establishment of such a service, through the formation of an outreach program,
              that would help to grow the involvement of more of higher education and related
              communities in the use and implementation of emerging high performance research
              and education networks.
