Recursive Locally Optimal Designs are to be developed to
              achieve optimality in a neighborhood of a desired operating regime.  These
              designs are to retain the large region stability and inverse optimality
              properties guaranteed by our earlier designs.
New Design Paradigms will
              include interlaced procedures, internal passivation and designs with growth
              restrictions.  These new developments will significantly enlarge the class of
              nonlinear systems to which our results will be applicable.
Unmodeled Dynamics
              and Sampling are inevitable issues to be faced in the implementation of
              feedback control laws.  We plan to analyze and increase robustness of nonlinear
              control laws to dynamic uncertainties using structure-specific tools based on
              singular perturbations, passivity and small gain theorems.
