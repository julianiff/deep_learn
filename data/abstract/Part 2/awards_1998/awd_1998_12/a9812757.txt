Abstract    :
              9812757
Steel corrosion and the resulting deterioration of reinforced concrete
              structures is one of the primary causes of increasing damage to infrastructure.
              A focus on concrete strength over durability, the growing use of deicing salts
              and chloride-containing admixtures, and construction in increasingly aggressive
              environments are some to the factors that have lead to the surge of concrete
              structures experiencing reinforcement corrosion in recent decades. [The
              concrete durability crisis, particularly involving the corrosion of embedded
              steel, is extensive, and published literature is replete with case histories
              indicating that there is a urgent need to develop a better understanding of the
              corrosion mechanism. The objective of this proposal is to establish a holistic
              study of corrosion of reinforced concrete. The research will  analyze the
              chemistry of the corrosion mechanism, develop new equipment to determine the
              degree of distress caused by the corrosion and test the new methodology in
              field conditions. We will promote an aggressive technology transfer to owners,
              conctactors and government agencies].
