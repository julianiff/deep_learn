Abstract    :
                9812547  Gonzales    The results of the physics test of the Third
              International Mathematics and Science Study for the school leaving population
              showed that the US students performed quite poorly compared to their peers in
              other countries.  A few explanations have been put forward for this unhappy
              result.  Much of the teaching (and learning) of physics at the high school (and
              college) level has been traditional memorizing algorithms and formulae.  Over
              the last few years the NSF has funded the development of instructional
              materials that require students to understand the concepts rather than memorize
              formulae.  ESIE has also funded the projects that provide professional
              development for teachers to teach using modeling and development of concepts. 
              This proposal is to test students who are learning from NSF developed materials
              or are being taught by teachers who took selected NSF-funded professional
              development, using the same instruments that were used by TIMSS.  This proposal
              provides an evaluation of the newer methods of teaching and learning physics to
              inform the physics teaching community
