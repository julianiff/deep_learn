Abstract    :
              IBN 98-12317  CARNEVALE      The aim of this project is to teach scientists how
              to use  NEURON, a powerful tool for simulating the function of nerve cells  and
              brain circuits. This course opens a new avenue through which  neuroscience
              investigators and teachers can learn to make  productive use of this essential
              new technology. NEURON is a  widely-accepted simulation tool designed
              specifically for  biologically realistic neural models.  Since it runs on all 
              leading computational platforms (UNIX/Linux, MSWindows 3.1, 95,  98, and NT,
              and MacOS), virtually every laptop and desktop  microcomputer sold in the
              country is capable of performing  research-quality simulations. The 5-day
              "hands-on" summer short-  course will be offered on an annual basis for three
              years.  It  will be announced through electronic email lists and through web 
              pages at: www.neuron.yale.edu and www.npaci.edu.    The potential importance of
              NEURON to the neuroscience community  derives from the fact that the nervous
              systems of all animals,  including human beings, perform tasks such as
              perception,  learning, and adaptive control, through computations that involve 
              the complex interactions of electrical and chemical signals that  are
              distributed in space and time. Engineers and computer  scientists have long
              found simulation to be indispensable for  understanding the operation of
              nonbiological computers. However  the tools used for simulating computer
              hardware are poorly suited  to studying biological computers (brains), because
              the machinery  of manmade systems is fundamentally different in construction
              and  operation from the "wetware" of the nervous systems found in even  the
              simplest animals. To achieve useful levels of convenience and  efficiency,
              neural simulators must be designed to take the special  features of biological
              systems into account.  The NEURON course  will teach the use of such tools.
