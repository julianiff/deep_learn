Abstract    :
              	Rate constants for free radical reactions in the liquid phase will be measured
              in the laboratory to determine the ionic strength, pH, and temperature
              dependence of several important reaction systems over a range of variables
              relevant to the atmosphere. Earlier measurements do not extend to the very high
              electrolyte concentrations that can occur in atmospheric aerosols. The focus of
              this work will be on the reactions of the nitrate radical with halogen species
              which are important to understand "halogen activation". This is a poorly
              understood process by which halides dissolved in aerosols are oxidized to yield
              photochemically active gas phase halogen-containing species. These can be
              photolyzed by sunlight and produce free halogen atoms, which attack gas phase
              ozone and other trace atmospheric constituents. These processes have been
              implicated in observed tropospheric ozone depletion events shortly after polar
              sunrise in the Arctic.
	Free radical reactions in the aqueous phase are
              initiated by photodissociation of precursors and by the solvation of gas phase
              free radicals. The measurements will be performed by using the laser flash
              photolysis/time-resolved absorption method. The experimental conditions are
              controlled in order to isolate the effects of ionic strength, pH, temperature,
              and any other variables desired. The rate constants which result from this work
              can be used directly in atmospheric models.
