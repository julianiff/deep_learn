Abstract    :
                   A fundamental property of most visual systems is directional  sensitivity,
              in which objects moving one direction are quickly  discriminated from objects
              moving in an opposite direction.  The  cellular mechanisms for this property
              are largely unknown.  This  collaborative research project brings together the
              skills of a  physiologist and an ultrastructural anatomist in a 
              multidisciplinary approach involving electrophysiology,  biochemistry,
              computational neuroscience and electron microscopy.  Using the well-studied
              visual system of crayfish as a model, this  project tests a novel hypothesis
              that the same excitable membrane  channel can integrate excitatory and
              inhibitory effects of two  different neurotransmitter compounds.  The technical
              difficulties  give the project a high level of risk, but the potentially very 
              high impact of the results, along with the experience  and skills  of the PIs,
              make taking the risk worthwhile.     Results will be important beyond simply
              invertebrate vision, to  understanding a fundamental property of visual
              systems, and to  clarifying a cellular mechanism of integration important to
              all  neuroscience as well as to cell physiology.
