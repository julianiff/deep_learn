Abstract    :
               The goal of this research project, a collaborative award with IIS-9812755, is
              to create and disseminate a software infrastructure for building complex and
              large-scale information systems that are both distributed and robust. The path
              to such systems lies in viewing distributed information systems as multi-agent
              systems: computational organizations consisting of potentially hundreds of
              intelligent real-time agents. Robust information systems will adapt both their
              functions and performance in response to changes in system goals, changes in
              performance requirements, and changes in the available software and hardware
              resources. A multi-agent architecture appropriate for such systems is being
              developed that contains component technologies for local agent scheduling,
              multi-agent coordination, organizational design, detection and diagnosis of
              inappropriate behavior in face of environmental change, and on-line learning to
              improve the performance of the other components. To evaluate this research, a
              multi-agent simulation testbed is being utilized to conduct extensive
              evaluation of the individual technologies, an integrated system prototype, and
              the issues of scalability to large agent societies. The impact of this work is
              to provide software, techniques and empirical studies that will facilitate the
              construction of the next generation of robust information
              systems.
