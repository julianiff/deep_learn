Abstract    :
                      9812778  Saul    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research investigates
              the efficacy and benefits of using scientific illustration to support the
              teaching of science to young children.  The project will bring together
              scientific illustrators with K-8 teachers to explore the types of techniques
              that are most appropriate for young children.  By using different artists, some
              of whom focus on nature and some on the engineered world, it is expected that
              teachers will learn, and pass on to students, another way of observing
              intensely and asking questions about structure, function, and movement. 
              Twenty-two exemplary teachers of science will be chosen for this initial pilot.
               They will work with artists over the summer and will collaborate with each
              other as they plan for the academic year.  In addition, there will be
              individual follow-up school visits as well as cohort meetings during the year
              to judge the success of the project and its implications for further research.
