              ABSTRACT:  CMU, Bonnie John, PI

This CISE Educational Innovation award
              provides funds to support the design, implementation, evaluation and
              dissemination of a new introductory-level course in computing which teaches the
              Strategic Use of Computer Systems.  This strategic knowledge has been developed
              under a 1994 NSF Young Investigator Award to the PI. It helps users decompose
              tasks effectively and efficiently with respect to the powers and limitation of
              their computer tools and has been shown to produce significant improvements in
              productivity.  The new course is being developed with a pilot section of
              students in the Computing Skills Workshop (CSW) course at CMU beginning in 1999
              and is expected to then be adopted by all of the CSW sections in the next year.
               The project has the potential to make major impact on undergraduate education
              in computing at a national level.
