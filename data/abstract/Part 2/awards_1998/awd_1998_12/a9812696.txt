Abstract    :
              9812696  Desai   This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
              (GOALI) research project is the continuation of work on an innovative model and
              test device for electronic packaging. Several new directions will be undertaken
              in the integration of laboratory testing, constitutive modeling and computer
              analysis. A new thermomechanical laser interferometry device has been developed
              and a series of tests will be performed to gain information on the effects on
              joining materials, including lead-free materials, of variations in cyclic
              mechanical and thermal loading. This thermomechanical behavior of the material
              will be incorporated into the unified constitutive modeling approach using the
              disturbed state concept (DSC).   The preliminary work has demonstrated the
              validity of the model for simple applications on various solders and silicon.
              This research project will focus upon characterizing the integration of the
              modeling and testing to permit future optimization of design and reliability
              analysis methodology.        This project addresses the significant need of
              having a better understanding of reliability in electronic packaging and the
              impact upon the microelectronics industry.
