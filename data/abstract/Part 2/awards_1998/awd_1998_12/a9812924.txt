              ABSTRACT
EEC-9812924
Dimarzio/Northeastern

This is an Exploratory Research
              Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center 
for
              Electromagnetics Research

The research objective is to advance the basic
              knowledge in maximizing the potential for non-invasive optical imaging of the
              human body.  It is anticipated that the project will result in improved in
              improved penetration, resolution, accuracy and diagnostic capability of
              diffusive-wave imaging to that it will become a safe and effective tool of
              medical diagnosis.  Specific objectives include (1) understanding the behavior
              of diffusive waves ins complicated tissues where the diffusion approximation is
              not valid, (2) inventing novel advanced imaging systems for improving spatial
              resolution, and (3) developing new algorithms to extract information from
              available data.
