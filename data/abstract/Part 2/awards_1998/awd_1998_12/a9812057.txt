Abstract    :
                        9812057  Imbens    A previous project (NSF grant number SBR9423018)
              collected data on people who played the Massachusetts lottery, including those
              who won small onetime prizes and people who won large prizes paid out over
              twenty years.   This project uses these data to compare people who played and
              won large amounts of money in the lottery, "winners", with people who played
              the lottery but did not win large amounts of money "losers"; the points for
              comparison include their labor supply, consumption and savings behavior, and
              the educational achievement of, and expenditures for, their children. The
              critical reason for collecting lottery data was to exploit the randomization in
              the lottery to reconstruct a randomized experiment with an infusion of income
              as the treatment condition.   For three reasons, namely the response rate in
              the survey was 50%, the probability of winning the lottery depends on the
              number of tickets bought (a variable which is only imperfectly observed), and
              the winners were drawn from a different population than the losers, there are
              pretreatment differences between the various groups. The investigators pursue a
              variety of methods to deal with adjustments to make the subsequent comparisons
              more credible.  Preliminary results suggest that adjusting for pretreatment
              differences leads to credible estimates of the causal effect of income on labor
              supply.
