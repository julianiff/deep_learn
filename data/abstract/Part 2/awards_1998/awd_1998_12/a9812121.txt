Abstract    :
              OCE 98-11557  Kastner  OCE 98-12121  Wheat  The recommended Collaborative
              project involves retrieval in 1999 of four OsmoSamplers deployed by the JOIDES
              Resolution in holes drilled in 1996 on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca
              Ridge during ODP Leg 168. In addition, liter-volume samples will be collected
              at the base of the boreholes, and borehole fluid temperature measurements will
              also be made. These holes were sealed with the ODP CORKs, which allow
              instrument retrieval and data readout through ports and interfaces to
              instrument strings on their top surface.  Retrieval involves five days of use
              of the Alvin submersible in association with a Wireline Re-entry Tool (WRT),
              further development of which will be funded by this proposal.  After retrieval,
              the OsmoSampler samples, representing a continuous record of borehole fluid
              composition for three years, will be analyzed for a large range of major, minor
              and trace elements, including Na, K, Li, Rb, Sr, Si, B, Ba, Mn, Fe, Br, F, NH4,
              NO3, PO4, SO4, and the rare earth elements. They will also be analyzed for a
              wide range of isotopic compositions, including those of H, O, Sr, B, Li, Cl,
              and Be. The large volume samples will be analyzed for tritium (to check for
              borehole fluid contamination with ambient seawater), Ar, Xe, CO2, and CH4
              concentrations, for He isotopic composition, and for C isotopes if enough CO2
              and CH4 are present.  The holes in the CORK will be capped after retrieval,
              with emplacement of a new instrument "cap" at one hole (Site 1026) for
              evaluation of the chemical response to local hydrographic changes where
              over-pressured basement fluids are currently venting.  This project will
              represent the best opportunity to date to obtain actual formation fluids that
              are circulating within the oceanic crust.  These samples will allow a
              fundamental examination of alteration processes occurring within the
              crystalline oceanic crust as it ages, providing a means for testing models of
              chemical flux between oceanic basement and seawater essential t owards
              understanding the composition of both.  ***
