Abstract    :
              Recent advances in genomic analysis have focused attention on the archaea, whose
              biochemical and genetic makeup partly mirror bacterial and eukaryal features. 
              In addition, archaea are a rich source of novel biochemical and molecular
              features.  Their investigation adds to knowledge of the variety of principles
              which underlie organismal existence.  These findings open new frontiers of
              research and provide fresh insights into evolution.

This Keystone Symposia
              meeting is bringing together scientists from different areas to highlight where
              archaea diverge from our current understanding of biochemical processes and to
              provide additional insight into the complexity of life.
