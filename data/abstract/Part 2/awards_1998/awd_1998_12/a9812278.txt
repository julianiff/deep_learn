Abstract    :
              This project will critically examine the potential for accreditation of programs
              in computer information science/systems/technology, including programs that
              cover essentially this material, but may have chosen to use a somewhat
              different title. This will include developing a set of criteria which could be
              used for accrediting such programs, the procedures for such accreditation, and
              surveying schools and employers to get their feedback as to both the value of
              such accreditation and any adjustments they would desire in the criteria and
              procedures that are developed.
