Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT      The Beringian Yupik Heritage Project  Krupnik, Walunga, Metcalf 
              9812881    This project analyzes and integrates the historical data accumulated
              in archival documents, old population censuses, genealogies, historical
              records, and early publications related to the Yupik community of St. Lawrence
              Island, Alaska.  Collected by scientists, missionaries, teachers, and
              government officers since the 1880s, these data remained for decades hardly
              known to the island residents. Together with oral histories and genealogical
              memory (local knowledge), these diverse sources of data will be integrated to
              produce an extended analysis of the last 120 years of island history and its
              relations with the Yupik people of Siberia.  The material will form a "St.
              Lawrence Island Sourcebook" and be introduced into the local school, language,
              and heritage curricula.  The project will enhance access to and use of
              historical resources by local residents of the Beringia area and pioneer a new
              pattern in ethnohistorical research aimed at bridging a modern community of
              some 1,500 people with its ancestral population via documentary records,
              genealogies, and oral tradition.  As a cooperative effort with the Yupik people
              of Siberia, the research fosters understanding of a common legacy among
              Beringian communities.
