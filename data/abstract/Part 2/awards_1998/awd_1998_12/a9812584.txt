Abstract    :
              Marcos Dantus is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to
              study the ultrafast transition state dynamics of unconstrained bimolecular
              reactions.  The primary goal is to gain significant insights into fundamental
              photoassociation reactions in order to understand better the breaking and
              formation of chemical bonds in collision processes.  Specific projects include
              real-time dynamical studies of Hg + I2 and Na + HF bimolecular reactions,
              controlling the impact parameter in photoassociation, and exploring the
              dependence of photoassociation on the initiating laser pulse
              characteristics.

Light absorption by a pair of unbound atoms or molecules
              while they are in proximity can lead them to react to form a new chemical bond.
               This process is called photoassociation.  Outcomes from this research effort
              will lead to the elucidation of previously unmeasurable aspects of bimolecular
              chemistry, such as reaction dependence on closeness and orientation of
              colliding atoms and molecules.  This understanding could impact studies of
              reactions relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistry, for example.  This
              research program also provides unique education and training opportunities for
              students at Michigan State University.
