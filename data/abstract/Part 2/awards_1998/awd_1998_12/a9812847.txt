Abstract    :
              9812847  Yang  This research project is aimed to establish a design  methodology
              for generating new conjugate kinematic pairs.  Based on this method, new high
              performance kinematic pairs,  such as gears, rotors, and cams for motion and
              power  transmission, are to be developed. The driving motivation  behind the
              project is threefold: (i) The practical and  analytical signficance of creating
              new conjugate kinematic  pairs for mechanical systems; (ii) The advantages of 
              Deviation-Function (DF) method in generating new conjugate  pairs for both
              circular and non-circular pitch curves; and  (iii) The lack of attention
              devoted to this important area  of study for a relatively long period of time,
              particularly  in the United States.  During the research phase, it is  planned
              to emphasize the following four focus studies:  1.  a deviation-function based
              design methodology for creating  new conjugate pairs; 2. design of
              High-load-capacity gears;  3.  new tooth profile design for non-circular gears;
              and 4.  design of advanced lobe pumps.  These studies are further  broken down
              into eleven carefully designed sub-tasks,  namely, design analysis, design
              synthesis, research for high-  load-capacity profiles, evaluation on gear
              conjugation  properties, considerations on practicality, experimentation, 
              pressure angle consideration, interference avoidance, design  of high pumping
              efficiency, design of flow rate, and the  design and testing of high-pressure
              lobe pumps.  ***
