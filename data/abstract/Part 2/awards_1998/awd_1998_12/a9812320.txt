This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Research award is for
              "Control Techniques for Environment-Friendly and Energy-Efficient Power
              Electronic Converters."  The principal investigators are Andrzej M.
              Trzynadlowski of the University of Nevada at Reno and Dr. Marian P.
              Kazmierkowski of the Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics of the
              Warsaw University of Technology.  The researchers intend to develop novel
              control schemes for environment-friendly and energy-efficient power electronic
              converters.  The project should yield two types of high-performance power
              electronic converters: a pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier and a PWM
              four-leg inverter to be used in adjustable-speed ac drive systems,
              uninterruptable power supplies, and interference, energy losses, and cost of
              the converters, while increasing their reliability.  Results of the project
              will enhance the current power electronic technology, with the consequent
              advantages for U.S. and Polish industries.  When implemented, the enhanced
              converters will reduce the electromagnetic and environmental pollution in power
              systems.   Also, the quality of graduate education at both universities will
              benefit from the cooperation.

This research in electrical engineering
              fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the
              U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity,
              and mutuality of benefit.
