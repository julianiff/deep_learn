The 1998 Gordon Research Conference on the Interior of the
              Earth, to be held June 28 - July 3, 1998 at 
New England College in Henniker,
              New Hampshire, will address major unanswered questions about the composition,
              structure, and dynamics of the Earth's interior.  There will be wide
              participation in the conference from a variety of perspectives including
              scientific discipline (geophysics, geochemistry, tectonics, and petrology),
              institution, demography, etc.  Funds will be used to insure the broad
              participation of students and young investigators located far from New
              Hampshire.
