Abstract    :
                    9812580  Wright  This award provides partial support to continue the
              Secretariat  of the U.S. side of the U.S./Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic 
              Effects.  The Wind and Seismic Effects panel promotes exchanges  of technology
              for reducing damages caused by strong winds,  earthquakes, and storm surge and
              tsunamis.  Through the panel,  U.S. and Japanese researchers jointly develop
              and share seismic  and high-wind measurement records and technical data, and 
              information on the performance, design, and construction of  lifelines,
              buildings, and other constructed facilities.  The  heart of the panel is its 12
              task committees.  Their activities  continue to grow in strength and have made
              significant  contributions toward advancing the missions of federal agencies 
              in design and construction practices.  A new task committee on  Seismic
              Information Systems was created at the Panel's 29th Joint  Meeting in May,
              1997.  ***
