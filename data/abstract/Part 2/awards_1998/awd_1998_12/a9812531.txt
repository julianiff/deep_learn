Abstract    :
                    9812531  Chopra  It has been recognized by the profession the need for
              designing  structures to meet stated performance goals.  A major challenge  is
              to develop simple, yet effective analytical methods for the  design,
              verification, evaluation and quality control of  structures so that they
              realistically meet the selected  performance objectives.    The overall
              objectives of this research project are to develop  dynamic analysis procedures
              suitable for the next generation of  seismic codes and guidelines to design new
              buildings and to  evaluate existing buildings.  A hierarchy of (i) elastic
              analysis  procedures to design or evaluate buildings for "fully  operational"
              or "operational" performance levels, (ii) inelastic  analysis procedures to
              design and evaluate buildings for  "operational," "life safe" or "near
              collapse" performance levels,  and (iii) criteria to evaluate the accuracy and
              the range of  applicability of each procedure will be developed.    Further,
              investigations will be conducted to (1) evaluate, from a  fundamental point of
              view, applicability of the present knowledge  to near-source ground motions;
              and (2) generalize the existing  analytical procedures or, if necessary,
              develop fundamentally  different methods for near-source excitations.    This
              project represents a collaborative effort with Japanese  researchers and
              Degnenkolb Engineers, (CMS-9812573).  Researchers  in the U.S. and Japan will
              use common near-source ground motions  recorded in both countries an calibrate
              their simplified  analytical procedures against common structures whose motions
               have been recorded during past earthquakes.     This project is supported
              under the first round (FY'98)  competition of the joint CMS-INT initiative NSF
              98-36, "US-Japan  Cooperative Research in Urban Earthquake Disaster
              Mitigation."  ***
