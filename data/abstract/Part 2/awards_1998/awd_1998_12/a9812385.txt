Abstract    :
                This project is an accomplishment based renewal extending the researcher's
              past work on rational behavior in institutional settings.  The research focuses
              the bases of conflict and cooperation and how they change over time. 
              Traditional understandings emphasize that these bases are derived from social,
              economic or spatial cleavages.  These cleavages animate studies of bargaining,
              collective action, alliances and coalition formation.  Non-cooperative game
              theory has produced sophisticated tools with which to model many of these
              instances of conflict and cooperation.  However, much of formal theory that has
              turned toward understanding these subjects has been static and cross-sectional.
               A snapshot at any particular point in time reveals the fault lines in a group,
              committee, or entire society.  However, it fails to reveal the long-term
              interests that lead to conflict or cooperation and the strategic interests that
              unfold over time.  This work models various indicators of time (like `age`)
              that allow a more nuanced consideration of the impact of time on rational
              behavior in institutional and social life.  This work has implications for many
              time dependent processes, including: the distribution of rewards,
              responsibilities, and incentives in the workplace, changing life expectancy,
              demographic bubbles and shocks, attitudes toward retirement, term limits and
              age discrimination.
