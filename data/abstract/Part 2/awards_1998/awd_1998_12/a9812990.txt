Abstract    :
              The long-term objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory of
              probabilistic and causal reasoning, specific enough for machine interpretation,
              so as to guide the construction of computer systems capable of planning,
              perceiving, and learning in uncertain dynamic environments.  The approaches
              described in this proposal are based on the use of probabilistic causal
              networks as the basic representational  scheme underlying the reasoning
              process.  Specific topics of interest are (1) Information fusion, diagnosis and
              planning under uncertainty using qualitative approximations of probabilities,
              utilities, causal and counterfactual relationships; (2)  Automatic generation
              of natural language explanations of actions, recommendations, and unexpected
              eventualities. The shorter term results of this research will be improved
              reasoning methods in applications such as medical diagnosis, sensor fusion, and
              automated management and control of manufacturing processes.  Another major
              impact of the proposed research will be improved experimental methods in the
              social and biological sciences, where causal inference is hindered by model
              uncertainty.
