Abstract    :
              This project will assist in upgrading the equipment component in the context to
              a 10-year modernization plan for FHL research support facilities and in
              particular a laboratory for marine molecular biology.  The equipment along with
              existing instruments, will be part of a new laboratory and will permit
              nucleotide sequencing at FHL.  Choice of the molecular biochemical focus, the
              new building and the equipment selected from a longer list, were by a process
              involving committee-led, open meetings and many potential users.
Forty-five
              others were polled by e-mail.  

The equipment will be especially helpful to
              developing fields of research in ecology, systematics, neurobiology, muscle
              physiology and bioluminescence.  The facility and its equipment will be coupled
              to a particularly rich biological diversity, and it is therefore hoped that new
              opportunities in presently unknown fields of inquiry will also develop.

The
              Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) is a marine biological field station of
The
              University of Washington, located in the San Juan Islands at the junction of
              Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits.  FHL was sited originally at this location in
              1903 because there is an unusual biodiversity present.  This biological
              richness attracts scientists as students in widely divergent fields from
              national and international universities and research institutions who require
              field or laboratory resources for the conduct of their work/studies.
