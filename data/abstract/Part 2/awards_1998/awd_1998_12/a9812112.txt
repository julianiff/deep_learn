Professor Erdogan Gulari of
              U. Michigan proposes to develop new alumina-supported gold and silver type for
              selective NO reduction or decomposition. Such catalysts will be useful for the
              NO pollutant elimination from exhaust gases obtained from the lean combustion
              of gasoline or diesel. The sol-gel synthesis already developed has been shown
              to produce catalysts that are highly selective to nitrogen. In the present
              work, the causes for the high selectivity will be determined, in order to
              provide the foundation for the development of new generation NO abatement
              catalysts. The mechanism of NO reduction and decomposition will be studied by
              transient and isotopic switching experiments. The catalyst structure will be
              determined by electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron and Raman
              spectroscopies, and x-ray diffraction. Parameters identified will include:
              nature and extent of metal support interaction; metal crystallite size
              distribution; metal oxidation state under reaction conditions; sol-gel
              preparation variables; surface species; and catalytic surface changes during
              reaction. This GOALI proposal involves a collaboration with Robert Hammerle, of
              Ford Motor Company.
