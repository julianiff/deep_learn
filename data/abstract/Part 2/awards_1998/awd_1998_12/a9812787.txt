Since
              1995 The US Navy has provided submarines for the SCICEX Program--annual
              scientific cruises under the Arctic Ocean. Designed to be quiet and stable, the
              submarine provides as ideal support infrastructure for the efficient
              acquisition of underway data, particularly swath mapping and bottom profiler
              data. This collaborative proposal is for the operation, integration, and
              removal of an instrument called Sea Floor Characterization and Mapping Pod
              (SCAMP). Data acquisition, software development data reduction and
              dissemination are also included in the proposal. SCAMP aims at acquiring swath
              bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles, and gravity data from the Arctic Ocean
              sea-floor. SCAMP is now mounted under the USS Hawkbill Navy submarine dedicated
              to the 1998 and 1999 SCICEX cruises. The instrument is to be operated as a
              facility open to any qualified scientist, and will acquire data that cannot be
              collected by any other means in the Arctic Ocean.
