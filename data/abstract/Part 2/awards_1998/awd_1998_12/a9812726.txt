Abstract    :
              Recently, what was once considered one highly variable genus of "leaf-eating" or
              colobine monkeys in Asia, known as Presbytis, was subdivided into three genera
              on the basis of different sets of shared anatomical features.  The separation
              of these three genera, Presbytis, Trachypithecus, and Semnopithecus, are now
              widely accepted by the primatology community.  However, questions remain as to
              (1) whether they are "good" genera, that is each contains a series of species
              all derived from a common ancestor that is separate from the common ancestors
              of the other related genera, and (2) what the relationships are among the
              species within each newly defined genus.  The proposed research attempts to
              answer these questions for one of the new genera, Presbytis.  Biological
              samples will be collected from a number of populations of each of the seven
              species in this genus.  Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA will be isolated from
              these samples and surveyed for variation.  This variation will be used to
              assess (1) whether each Presbytis species is indeed one species, (2) whether
              the Presbytis genus is indeed one genus, (3) the relationship of the Presbytis
              species to one another, and (4) the relationship of the Presbytis genus to the
              other Asian Leaf-monkey genera.  Answers to all of these questions will give us
              insight into the evolutionary history of this very diverse group of primates,
              and the differential ability of variation in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
              to shed light on that history.  Secondarily, it will also give us information
              that can be used to conserve these highly endangered mammals.
