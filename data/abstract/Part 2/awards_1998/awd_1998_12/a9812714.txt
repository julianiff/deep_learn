Abstract    :
              This project studies human interaction with virtual human characters, forming a
              virtual social group.  It uses an existing virtual society model at Caltech,
              experienced as a graphical display of virtual humans which interact socially. 
              An interface, including recognition of the user's gestures and eye gaze using
              computer vision, allows a user to participate.  The research uses simplified
              social situations derived from a survival world where a social group of people
              survive by maintaining their social organization, by explicit social
              interaction, and by cooperatively building dwellings, exploring to find wood
              and fruits, and by hunting animals.  The results will provide answers to
              questions such as whether a group experience occurs, whether a believable
              virtual social group can be created, and which social interactions lead to
              believability of characters.  Potential commercial applications include the
              implementation of a usable virtual social group, from which may be developed
              animations for movies, interactive games, educational settings and business
              information settings.  Future computer use will require extended continuous
              interaction and involvement by the user.  Socially supportive virtual settings,
              allowing users to achieve their best, promise a new era of computer use.
