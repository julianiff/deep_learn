Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham is
              hosting an international conference on differential equations and mathematical
              physics during March 16-20, 1999, in Birmingham. Topics will include the
              analysis of multiparticle Schroedinger operators, stability of matter,
              relativity theory, fluid dynamics, spectral and scattering theory including
              inverse problems, as well as related topics. There will be ten plenary lectures
              given by the following leading experts: Profs. S.Y.A. Chang (Princeton), D.
              Christodoulou (Princeton); P. Lax (NYU), E. Lieb (Princeton), P.L. Lions
              (Paris), A.I. Nachman (Rochester), S.P. Novikov (Steklov Institute and
              University of Maryland), B. Simon (Cal Tech), J. Smoller (Michigan), J.
              Yngvason (Vienna). There will be 30 minute lectures organized in parallel
              topical special sessions of six to eight talks each (organizers in
              parentheses): General Relativity (G. Galloway, Miami), Integrable Systems (F.
              Gesztesy, Missouri), P.D.E.'s in Geometry (Y. Li, Rutgers), Quantum Mechanics
              (H. Siedentop, Regensburg), and Inverse Problems.  There will also be parallel
              sessions for up to one hundred 30-minute contributed talks.

Previous
              conferences with related emphases in this series were held in March of 1981,
              1983, 1986, 1990, and 1994 at UAB and in March of 1992 and 1997 at the Georgia
              Institute of Technology. This conference series between UAB and Georgia Tech
              has been of great interest in the past, both here and internationally, bringing
              together scholars from around the world for fruitful scientific exchange in an
              active area in which modern mathematical analysis comes to grips with problems
              of scientific importance.
