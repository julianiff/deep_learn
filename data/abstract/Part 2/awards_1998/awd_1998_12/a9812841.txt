Abstract    :
              This study will examine the relationship between polyandry and
paternity in the
              Red-necked Phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus): an 
arctic-nesting, gender
              role-reversed, non-territorial shorebird with 
uniparental male care. Some
              females can produce up to 16 eggs in one 
breeding season;in contrast, males
              are able to produce one brood of four 
chicks, unless they are able to
              fertilize eggs that will be incubated by 
another male.  Because sperm storage
              occurs in many bird species and 
because the time between clutches can be very
              brief in phalaropes (3-4 
days), there is great potential for first males to
              fertilize eggs in 
subsequent polyandrous clutches.  Such extra-pair
              fertilizations (EPFs) 
should be most likely in the first egg of a subsequent
              polyandrous clutch, 
according to the passive sperm loss model.  EPFs will be
              determined by DNA 
fingerprinting (using multilocus probes) of sequential
              clutches by the 
same female, using blood and tissue samples from both parents
              and from 
embryos. The project dovetails well with behavioral observations of
              these birds that will document timing of copulation attempts and successful
              copulations.  This study extends work on sexual conflict / sperm competition by
              Oring et al. 
(1992) to a non-territorial polyandrous species.
