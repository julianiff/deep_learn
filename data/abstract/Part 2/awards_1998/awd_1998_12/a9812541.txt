This proposal requests support for the
              Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations.  This
              conference has a history dating back to 1981, and has an established record of
              providing new investigators and advanced graduate students a forum in which to
              exchange new ideas and discuss recent developments.  In particular, the
              conference invites young investigators to present there work to an expert
              audience.  The primary objective of this proposal is to secure support for
              advanced graduate students and recent PhDs to participate in this meeting.
