Abstract    :
                    9812556  Nigg  This award is to the Disaster Research Center at the
              University  of Delaware for a collaborative research project with the  Research
              Center for Disaster Reduction Systems, a unit within the  Disaster Prevention
              Research Institute at Kyoto University.  The  objectives of the project are to
              better understand: (1) the  expectations that public and stakeholder groups
              have concerning  likely earthquake impacts on the built environment; (2) the 
              importance they attach to the survivability and performance of  various
              elements of the built environment, including  infrastructure systems (bridges,
              highways, utility lifelines);  and (3) their policy preferences with respect to
              mitigation and  other loss-reduction strategies, with a particular emphasis on 
              understanding what are considered acceptable levels of  performance, loss, and
              disruption.  The project uses two  methodologies to investigate these issues:
              (1) a community survey  of randomly selected residents in the Oakland/Alameda
              County area  of California; and (2) small group exercises of prominent members 
              of four constituency groups--engineers, local government  officials,
              representatives of the business and financial  community, and city and county
              residents--in that same area.  ***
