Abstract    :
              New techniques to dramatically extend the sensitivity and resolution  in imaging
               biological specimens using novel methods of optical excitation and 
              manipulation of  biological materials on solid surface will be developed. The 
              controlled penetration  depth of optical excitation in evanescent wave
              fluorescence will be  combined with  ordered arrays of biological molecules on
              solid surfaces, allowing  high-resolution optical sectioning of analytes bound
              specifically to  biomolecules. By so extending Total Internal  Reflection
              Fluorescence (TIRF) with sensitive vertical sectioning,  two significant
              hurdles  will be overcome: First, by distinguishing between analytes bound 
              specifically to the surface and those adhered non-specifically,  enhancement in
              sensitivity by an order of magnitude and hence  selectivity is expected in
              solid-phase assays. Second, the extension  of evanescent fluorescence
              techniques with vertical sectioning to  unprecedented resolution levels (in the
              order of 10 nm) will allow  for the development of many novel and powerful
              diagnostic  techniques. Utilizing modern optoelectronics and single-mode
              optical  waveguides, the complexity and ultimate cost of the detection 
              apparatus will be reduced, making possible the application of these  techniques
              to a wide variety of bioanalytical assays.
