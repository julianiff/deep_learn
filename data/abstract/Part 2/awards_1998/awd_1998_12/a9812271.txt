Abstract    :
              Combining the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and radar data, the PI gains
              information on circulations and momentum sources/sinks in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere (MLT).  By properly combining radar and wind imaging
              interferometer measurements with High Resolution Doppler Imager winds, the PI
              can determine the MLT transport circulation directly from global wind
              observations.  In addition, improved estimates of gravity-wave driving allows
              improved simulations of circulation systems in the MLT region and at
              stratospheric levels.  Finally, the research will result in estimations of
              mesospheric winds from thermal data.
