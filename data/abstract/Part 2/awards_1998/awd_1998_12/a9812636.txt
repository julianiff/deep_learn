Abstract    :
              This CISE Educational Innovation award provides support to develop, test and
              disseminate innovations in the computer engineering undergraduate curriculum at
              this institution to emphasize real-time information processing systems to
              introduce undergraduate students to the areas of signal processing, image
              processing, cognition, human-computer interaction, and computer technology, in
              preparation for transition to graduate study or to industry.  This laboratory
              builds on the existing and developing laboratories in Interactive Design and in
              Microcomputers.  The institution has a strong record of involvement with
              underrepresented groups and that will continue in this project.  Further, the
              project is planned such that key components will be able to be replicated  at
              other institutions at reasonable cost.
