"Four-dimensional Variational Data
              Assimilation and GPS Data Impact Study Using the NCEP Global Model"

	Dr.
              Zou, in collaboration with scientists at the National Centers for Environmental
              Prediction (NCEP) of the National Weather Service, will build a
              four-dimensional variational data assimilation system to be used with the
              operational NCEP global forecast model.  The system will employ the adjoint of
              a full-physics version of the NCEP model.  The PI will then assess the value of
              using (1) a full-physics (vs. a simpler) version of the model in the
              assimilation process and (2) a four-dimensional versus the [current
              operationally run] three-dimensional data assimilation system.  In addition to
              improving the potential for better weather forecasts, such a system could be
              used for a variety of research problems, including testing the potential impact
              of various future observing systems that produce observations that are
              spatially and temporally irregular.
