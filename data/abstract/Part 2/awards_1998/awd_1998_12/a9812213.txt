Abstract    :
              ECS-9812213  Krogh      In this research project a new class of switching
              controllers will be investigated.  Given multiple controllers for a plant, each
              designed for possibly different operating regions with distinct regions of
              stability and performance characteristics, the controller to be applied at each
              sampling instant will be selected according to on-line evaluations of the
              future potential closed-loop system performance for each of the controllers. 
              The switching controller will achieve a larger operating region and better
              performance than could be realized using any one of the controllers alone. 
              Neural networks will be trained to estimate cost-to-go functions and stability
              regions based on experimental data using techniques from neural dynamic
              programming.  State feedback and output feedback controllers will be studied as
              will as algorithms for on-line learning of performance measures.  Policy
              iteration techniques will be investigated for optimizing the switching
              strategies.  Closed-loop stability and performance will be studied drawing on
              the theory of stability and invariant sets in hybrid dynamic systems.  The
              switching control strategies will be demonstrated using simulation.
