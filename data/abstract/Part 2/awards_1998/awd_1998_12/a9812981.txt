     The objective of this research project is to establish a
              new applicable penetration enhancement technology based on double-sided arc
              welding (DSAW) to increase penetration capability.  In this way, the welding
              current passing through the work is thought to enhance the localized energy
              input. The scope of work addresses basics physics, novel process development,
              and process control issues. The experimental study will emphasize the
              fundamental understanding of the process in order to develop key technological
              foundations for implementation. This requires specific understanding of the
              power supply-torch-work-torch-power supply energy /material loop and the
              resulting heat affected zone.
     The modeling techniques  are
              state-of-the-art for the process modeling. The investigator includes a plan to
              educate graduate students in both the fundamental science integration and the
              potential for industrial applications. The impact on industry should be
              significant and several industries are committed to providing equipment and
              engineering support for the future development of this novel process at a
              production level.
