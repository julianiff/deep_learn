Abstract    :
              This CRCD project supports the development of materials for teaching Hardware
              and Software Codesign.  This addresses design for digital systems that are
              built with a combination of specialized circuits, general purpose
              microprocessors, and software.  Traditional courses examine such systems as
              their separate hardware and software parts under the assumption that the other
              part is fixed.  Codesign allows examining how decisions in one domain affect
              the other domain.  This project will build on research in simulators for
              codesign use; the project will build a simulator version for teaching use and
              incorporate it into a senior design course and will introduce codesign concepts
              in other courses.  A workbook, text, or interactive CD-ROM will be produced to
              distribute this material.  Overall, this project will introduce more realistic
              design projects into the curriculum and enable more realistic optimization of
              design projects.
