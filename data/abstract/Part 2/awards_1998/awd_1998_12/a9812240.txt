               Special Project:  Demand for Information Workers from the Perspective of Core
              Producers    This award supports the development of a study to examine the
              information worker shortage primarily as it relates to four-year educational
              programs in the core computing fields: computer science, and engineering.  The
              study is directed by a primary task force made up of representatives of
              professional societies in the computing field, along with a labor economist, a
              human resources specialist, individuals familiar with issues of
              underrepresented groups, a representative from community college and four-year
              college activities and other appropriate individuals.  Evaluation of the data
              is being carried out by professionals experienced in the area of statistical
              data analysis.  A report of the task force is planned to be issued at a public
              meeting in 1999.
