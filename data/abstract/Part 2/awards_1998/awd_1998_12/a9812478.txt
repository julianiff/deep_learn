Abstract    :
                  9812478  Krawinkler  Control of damage is a critical issue that is not
              addressed  adequately in present seismic design procedures, and the ground 
              motions near the ruptured fault segments can be much greater and  of different
              characteristics than the ground motions considered  in present design
              procedures.  In particular, near-fault ground  motions contain pulse-type
              characteristics that are not captured  by the spectral representations of
              today's codes.  Damage control  and other important performance levels are
              being addressed in  performance based engineering approaches that are under 
              development in various organizations.    The objective of this research project
              is to develop knowledge  that permits the incorporation of near-fault effects
              in a  performance based seismic design format.  The following  investigations
              will be conducted:    (a) Synthesize available information on seismic demands
              imposed by near-fault ground motions and pulse-type input on various types of
              structural systems,  (b) generate additional data on seismic demands to
              complement the  available information as needed for a comprehensive assessment
              of near-fault effects,  (c) draw conclusions on specific issues critical for
              performance based design, and  (d) utilize the acquired knowledge to combine
              near-fault effects  and performance based design.    The challenge of the
              research will be to provide effective  guidelines that will permit system
              concept development and  performance evaluation based on a description of the
              seismic  hazard for different return periods and a comprehensive set of 
              performance criteria, with due consideration given to the  characteristics of
              near-fault ground motions.    This is an award under the first round (FY'98)
              competition of the  CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36 "US-Japan Cooperative Research
              in  Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation".  ***
