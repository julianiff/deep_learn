Moore
Dr. Berrien Moore will serve as Chair of the Scientific
              Committee
(SC) of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP),
              an
interdisciplinary program for research on global change sponsored
by the
              International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The IGBP
focuses on
              interactive biological and chemical Earth-system
processes, the changes that
              these processes are undergoing, and the
interaction between these processes
              and human activity.  The IGBP
is organized around a series of "core projects"
              planned and
implemented on an integrated international basis with
              substantial
participation by U.S. scientists, primarily under the aegis of
              the
U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP).  The SC-IGBP
              provides
international oversight and coordination for the complex series
              of
IGBP core projects, as well as for related scientific support
activities,
              including a major scientific data and information
exchange system.
