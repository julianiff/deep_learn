Abstract    :
                  Lay Abstract    EDMONDS, Kent  98-128224      The goals of the proposed
              studies are to examine the roles  of photoperiod, the circadian system,
              melatonin, the pineal  gland, and food intake in regulating the magnitude of 
              compensatory gonadal hypertrophy (CGH) in a reproductively  photoperiodic
              rodent, the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys  palustris). Compensatory gonadal
              hypertrophy results when  the surgical removal of one gonad produces a dramatic
               increase in the size of the remaining gonad.  Studies will  be conducted on
              hemi-castrated male and female marsh rice  rats housed under different
              photoperiodic regimes, or  melatonin treatment conditions.  Dr. Edmunds will
              also  examine the extent to which CGH is mediated by the circadian  system by
              conducting "resonance" experiments.  Because CGH  has only been studied in
              laboratory strains of rodents, this  work is important to discover the effects
              of photoperiod on  CGH.  The results of this work may provide insights into the
               mechanisms underlying CGH and the possible ramifications of  melatonin
              treatment on CGH processes.
