The quantitative characterizartion of
              microstructural constituents in an aluminum automotive alloy at various scales
              of observation is performed. Wavelet analysis of digitized image data is used
              to identify and examine the wavelet coefficients. The stress concentrations
              associated with microstructural features that initiate crack are determined by
              examining the energy of wavelet transforms. The heterogeneous features induced
              by fatigue cycles are also indentified using wavelet analysis. Such
              identification leads to information that suggests ways to modify processing
              and/or composition of the alloy for superior performance.***
