Abstract    :
              This new research project is focussed on systematic first principles
              calculational studies of the adsorption of S, C, and O atomic adsorbates on
              Ni(100) and Cu(100) surfaces.  This work in the group of Professor Talat Rahman
              at Kansas State University is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program.  Adsorbate induced structural changes are examined, with the goal of
              gaining insight into the mechanisms of chemisorption on transition metal
              surfaces.  A wealth of experimental data is available for these model systems,
              which is carefully compared with the results of ab initio calculations. 
              Theoretical methods have recently been developed which enable these studies,
              and the insight into chemisorption, catalysis, and corrosion processes which
              results.  These methods are based on density functional theory and non-local
              psuedo-potential plane wave calculations.

Theoretical methods are becoming
              available which enable the calculation of the electronic and geometric
              structure of transition metal/atomic adsorbate systems from first principles. 
              In combination with detailed experimental data on the structure, energetics,
              and electronic properties of selected model systems, a great deal of insight is
              obtained about the mechanisms of transition metal chemisorption.  This is the
              focus of this research project.  The insights gained from these detailed
              fundamental studies help to understand heterogeneous catalytic processes,
              corrosion, and surface modification technologies.
