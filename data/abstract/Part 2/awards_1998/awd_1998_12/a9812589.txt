Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:  UMass, W. Burleson,  PI

This CISE Educational Innovation project
              supports the development of a series of multimedia instructional modules in
              areas of computer engineering.  The modules are presented with innovative
              multimedia techniques thus providing a direct example of the technology that
              they discuss.  The project also includes development of an archive of design
              projects related to multimedia systems and linked to the instructional modules
              at various levels.  The modules and design projects are developed in the
              context of six different undergraduate courses at the university. 
              Dissemination is accomplished through use of Digital Video Disks (DVD) and
              through the Video Instructional Program at the institution, a distance
              education program with a 23-year history of use.  Underrepresented groups are
              involved, through the Women's Engineering and Minority Engineering programs at
              the University and through the involvement of Smith College, a women's college,
              and the University of Massachusetts-Boston and Springfield Technical College,
              both of which serve significant numbers of minority students.
