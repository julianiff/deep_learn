              Message Contents -------------------------------  9812514              Summary:
              The proposed instrumentation project requests funds to   develop a sensor that
              can be used to determine the Eulerian or   profiled measurement of turbulent
              kinetic energy rates in high energy   environments such as the bottom and
              surface boundary layers. The new   sensor will offer the capability to measure
              the full dissipation   spectrum directly via backscatter. It will also permit
              the analysis of   statistics of the dissipation variable. Initial development
              of the   single-axis laboratory prototype of this sensor was funded via an NSF 
               SBIR grant (95-60930), and follow-on funding for final development was  
              recommended by the Phase II SBIR technical panel (see reviews for   97-10425),
              but was not ultimately obtained.   This proposal is a collaborative proposal
              with Dr. John Trowbridge at   WHOI (98-12514). First, the PI proposes further
              development of the   instrument, which is necessary since a two axis system
              will be required   for a field instrument and the PI plans to incorporate a new
              fast   Doppler signal processor and data storage media. Secondly, the PI and  
              Dr. Trowbridge (WHOI) will conduct a bottom boundary layer   inter-comparison
              experiment on the south shore of Martha's Vineyard.   The object of this
              experiment is to examine dissipation as measured   directly by the laser
              sensor, and as deduced from turbulent spectra   using an acoustic Doppler
              velocimeter.
