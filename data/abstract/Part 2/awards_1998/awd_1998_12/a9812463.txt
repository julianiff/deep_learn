Abstract    :
              Ridge axis diking/eruptive events are episodic perturbations that trigger a
              sequence of interrelated and rapidly evolving physical, chemical, and
              biological processes associated with the formation of Ocean crust.  Volcanic
              activity produces hydrothermal discharge with a distinct geochemical signature,
              and triggers specific geochemical and microbial responses in the adjuacent
              crust and overlying water-column.  Observing and quantifying co-variation among
              related processes provides basic new constraints on presently immature models
              of submarine volcano-hydrothermal systems.  Chemical and biological parameters
              within hydrothermal plumes change rapidly, with the steepest rate of change
              occurring over seconds to days following their discharge and subsequent mixing
              in the deep sea.  Here we propose to mount comprehensive rapid and follow-up
              field responses to a remotely detected MOR volcanic event.  Our project
              emphasizes time-series observations and experiments on key dynamic physical,
              geochemical, and geomicrobial properties of an evolving hydrothermal event
              plume.  A rapid response to these events will allow us:  (1) to obtain the
              initial flux--that unaffected by aging; (2) to study the chemical and
              biological evolution of hydrothermal event plumes, representing a natural,
              temporarily constrained experiment for monitoring transformations within
              hydrothermal effluents; (3) to exploit event plumes as an invaluable window to
              the subsurface bioshpere.
