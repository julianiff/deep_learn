Abstract    :
              DMI-9812084  Beaman    The Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium is a topical
              meeting where a research exchange in the area of rapid prototyping is promoted.
              This meeting draws approximately 200 participants, researchers from
              universities, companies and national laboratories, as well as students and
              international researchers. Sessions are planned with the expectation that the
              current year will have sessions similar to the 1997 symposium, with
              approximately 90 talks and posters.    This symposium provides an excellent
              venue for students, encouraging interactions with leading experts in the field
              of rapid prototyping. This award from the National Science Foundation will
              provide student support to attend the 1998 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium
              to be held August 10-12. 1998 in Austin, Texas.
