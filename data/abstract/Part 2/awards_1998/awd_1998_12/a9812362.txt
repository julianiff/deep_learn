Abstract    :
              The research in this proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that bacterial
              transporters with diverse substrates have a common mechanism of action, i.e.
              the choice of substrate is mediated by subtle differences in amino acid
              sequences of the transporters.  The specific aims are:  1) to isolate
              spontaneous mutants of various transporters with altered substrate specificity.
               This will be done by selection of transporter mutants on minimal media plates
              with different carbon sources, such as maltose, sucrose, lactose, melibiose,
              and raffinose; 2) to determine the DNA sequence of the isolated mutants that
              have altered substrates specificities; and 3) to demonstrate that the newly
              acquired function exists in the mutants by measuring transport activity.  The
              results from this research will be used in the development of a RUI proposal to
              test structure/function predictions of transporter proteins that will be
              submitted at a later date.
