Abstract    :
                  9812464  Wight  There are several significant challenges for the structural 
              engineer who wants to implement the performance-based design  procedure.  One
              set of challenges involves a more thorough  understanding of the inelastic
              force-deformation relationships  for individual members and structures, and the
              need to make  design decisions in terms of displacements instead of forces.  A 
              second set of challenges involves the development of clear  definitions for
              "performance states" and the determination of  what types of structural and
              nonstructural damage to expect at  those states.    This project is aimed at
              the organization of existing information  and the development of new
              experimental information for  application of performance-based design
              procedures to reinforced  concrete (RC) moment-resisting frame structures.  In
              particular,  this study will concentrate on the inelastic behavior of beam-to- 
              column connections and their effect on the lateral force vs.  lateral
              displacement relationship for a RC frame structure.  A  large amount of data
              exists on the inelastic behavior of RC beam-  column connections, but that
              information must be reorganized for  application to a "push-over" analysis,
              which is the fundamental  analysis technique in the performance based design
              procedure.   Also, additional information for particular nonstandard beam- 
              column joint configurations will be developed.    This is an award under the
              first round (FY'98) competition of the  CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36 "US-Japan
              Cooperative Research in  Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation".  ***
