Description: This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Drs. Christine W. Jarvis and Hassan M. Behery of the Department of
              Textiles at Clemson University in South Carolina and Drs. Sami Mansour of the
              Textile Department at the National Research Center in Cairo, and Moustafa
              El-Okiely of the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University in Egypt.  The
              two sides plan to study the need for a scientific and engineering-based system
              for costing of textiles and garments, and to develop the basis for such a
              system in Egypt with its specific developing world conditions of productions
              and consumption. 

Scope:  This award will allow collaboration between
              Egyptian and US scientists on a problem of great importance to many developing
              countries where the textile segment of the industries is a major contributor to
              the national income and especially to the foreign currency earnings.   The
              survival of these textile industries depends to a great extent on efficient
              operation and pricing that will generate resources for R & D improvements white
              maintaining global competitiveness.  Dr. Jarvis is the Director of Clemson
              Apparel Research (CAR) at Clemson University, which has extensive
              state-of-the-art apparel manufacturing equipment and some of the best available
              hardware and software for the proposed study.  The NRC and Alexandria
              University have strong collaboration with and access to the garment industry in
              Egypt.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign
              collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being
              supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to
              scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative
              activities.
