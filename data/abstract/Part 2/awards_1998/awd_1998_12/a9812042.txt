Abstract    :
              9812042  Enderle  The objective of this proposal is the construction of design 
              projects for the disabled by electrical engineering students  at the University
              of Connecticut.  The projects are custom  designed to address the specific
              needs of persons with  disabilities.  The goals of these projects is to provide
               devices or software that are typically too expensive, or  nonexistent to aid
              individuals with disabilities, and to  enhance the educational opportunities
              for students.  This  activity is in cooperation with an investigator from the 
              School of Hearing and Speech Science at Ohio University.  The students will
              design and build a device for a particular  disabled individual in the vicinity
              of the University of  Connecticut or Ohio University.  ***
