Title: Investigation
              of the Rain Process Using Mathematical Models and Observational Data

This
              project will improve our understanding of the way raindrops grow and interact
              with each other to produce a broad range of drop sizes.  Some collisions
              between drops lead to simple coalescence and the formation of a larger drop;
              others may cause breakup of the colliding drops and the production of smaller,
              satellite droplets. A mathematical formulation of this problem requires
              knowledge of the fall speeds and collision cross sections of drops of different
              sizes, the probability of breakup, and the size distribution of the satellite
              droplets.  The first phase of the project will provide analytical
              approximations to the sparse existing laboratory data on drop breakup.  This is
              essential for generalizing the equations that describe the evolution of the
              drop-size distribution by the collision-coalescence process to include the
              effects of drop breakup.  The second phase will compare model predictions with
              the drop-size distributions measured by Doppler radar in natural clouds.  If
              the predictions agree with observations it will support the use of the model in
              theoretical calculations of rain development under different environmental
              conditions.
