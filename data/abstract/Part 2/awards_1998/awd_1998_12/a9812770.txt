Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Oklahoma State University  Karen High    The objective of this
              planning grant to the Oklahoma State University is to study the feasibility of
              formation of an Industry/University Co-operative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
              Measurement and Control. The Center will operate as an affiliate to the I/UCRC
              on the same topic at the University of Tennessee. Industry commitments for
              participation will be obtained, and the research agenda will be developed at an
              industry/university workshop. The plan for research and management coordination
              with the I/UCRC at University of Tennessee will be finalized.
