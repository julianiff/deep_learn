Both the U.S. and Japan face similar serious earthquake hazards
              including the threat of near field events. This has been clearly demonstrated
              by the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes.  Both countries are currently
              re-examining their design and analysis methodologies in light of the measured
              data and observed structural performance in these earthquakes, while moving
              toward a new generation of "performance-based" methodologies for structural
              design and analysis.

The purpose of this project is to conduct an integrated
              U.S. Japan study of near-field ground motions and their implications for
              structural design.  The research is focused on the development and evaluation
              of simplified methods for describing the performance of structural systems. 
              This study is intended to resolve a number of important issues that have been
              identified in earlier studies.  It is also intended to help provide a firmer
              basis for performance-based engineering approaches in the U.S. and Japan
              considering near-field effects.

The specific objectives of the research
              are:

1. To analyze a selection of near-field accelerograms form the U.S. and
              Japan in order to determine the most important characteristics that need to be
              taken into account for structural analysis and design,
2. To examine various
              types of demand spectra that may be used for near-field earthquake ground
              motions, 
3. To perform parametric studies of the response of a set of
              idealized  structural models with different hysteretic properties subjected to
              a variety of near-field ground motions,
4. To gain fundamental insight into
              the nature of the inelastic response of structural systems subjected to
              near-field ground motions,
5. To develop, as appropriate, simplified analysis
              procedures for structures subjected to near-field ground motions, and
6. To
              apply the simplified  analysis procedures to representative design and 
              problems in order to validate their usefulness.
