Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9812409  W.B. Russel, Princeton University  The objective of this
              proposal is to develop a theoretical basis supported by experiments for the
              formulation of concentrated dispersions with tailored rheology by investigating
              the relationship among interparticle forces, microstructure and rheological
              properties.  Examples will include stable dispersions of spheres containing end
              block and chain associative polymers.  Experiments combine rheological
              measurements with dynamic light scattering and rheo-optical techniques.  The
              data will be interpreted using non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and
              including the treatment of micelles and brushes form the polymer literature.  A
              conservation equation describes the microstructure of a dispersion of Brownian
              spheres interacting through pairwise additive potentials, short range
              hydrodynamical interactions, and subjected to shear or other external fields.  
              The proposed research has relevance to materials and chemicals industries where
              the connection between composition, microstructure and rheological behavior are
              important.   ***
