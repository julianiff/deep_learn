This U.S.-Hungarian research project between Jane
              Vanderkooi of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Judit Fidy of
              Semmelweis University, Budapest, will examine chromophore/protein matrix
              interactions of functional significance in plant peroxidase systems.  Their
              approach involves a combination of computational and high-resolution
              vibrational and electronic spectroscopic methods and features two peroxidases
              whose structures are known: horseradish peroxidase and yeast cytochrome c
              peroxidase.  If successful, results should contribute to our basic
              understanding of biophysics and the biochemistry of heme proteins, a family of
              enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aromatic compounds by hydrogen peroxide.
              
 
Planned experiments include: 1) binding studies using low temperature
              adsorption and laser fluorescence line narrowing to probe coupling between
              chromophore and protein matrix; 2) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to
              probe matrix conformational heterogeneity and the heme geometry, and 3)
              molecular dynamics to model substrate binding and docking in conjunction with
              electrostatic calculations.  These are expected to show the interaction between
              prosthetic group and apoprotein as well as the functional significance of
              structural and conformational heterogeneity. 

This project in molecular
              biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.
