The National Science Foundation (NSF) plans to organize a
              series of workshops called "Vision 21: Environmental Electric Energy
              Opportunities for the Next Century", on the future technologies to support the
              Nation's electrical supply, delivery and consumption for the 21st century. 
              Following are the proposed themes and objectives:

1.	Anticipate and explore
              the science, technology and security needs for the restructured electric supply
              systems of the next century.

2.	Educate technologists about the coming
              trends in emerging generation, storage and delivery systems, control and
              communication systems needs, energy efficiency, load matching, advanced power
              delivery and conversion concepts, etc.

3.	Identify the impact of the US
              electric power industry on global climate change.

4.	Discuss and contrast
              several diverging expert views of the electric utility of the future
And
              search for common technical and policy themes and directions.

5.	Provide
              suggestions for academic researchers regarding valuable energy technology
              investigation areas.

The first workshop in this series is scheduled for
              27-29 April 1998 in Crystal City, VA and will focus on distributed resources
              and communication system needs as listed below.  This will present the
              prospects for leading energy technologies, provide a lasting vision of our
              energy future and give the attendees a window to the needs and opportunities in
              the next century.  Major topics will include:

Renewable Energy
Advanced
              Microturbines
Fuel Cells
Storage and Energy Efficiency
Communication System
              Needs
Data Monitoring Needs
Power Quality Issues
Environmental
              Impacts
