Abstract    :
              This research creates and evaluates algorithms, representations, and display
              structures that analyze---and help the human video browser understand and
              search---the scenic and thematic structure of extended (half-hour or more)
              video sequences.  These algorithms and representations segment dramas,
              comedies, newscasts, sporting events, and talk shows into three levels of
              structural significance: camera shots; scenes, or sets; and the thematic
              repetitions of scenes, or acts, thus providing a means to recapture something
              like the originating ``storyboard'' level of the video's outline.  These three
              levels of semantically coherent units are then displayed in a novel musical
              score-like graphic format, with user variable precision and detail.  This work
              explores four aspects of analysis: the selection of appropriate low-level image
              features, the design of representations and relationships of  structure at each
              of the three levels based on tunable human memory models, the exploration of
              display configurations and video subsequence selection for effective user
              browsing, and the validation of algorithmic optimizations and user feedback
              over a large corpus of videos.  This work makes explicit some of the structural
              rules and heuristics that govern the creation of thematically coherent long
              video sequences.  Educationally, these issues have already inspired a new upper
              division course, "Visual Interfaces to Computers".
