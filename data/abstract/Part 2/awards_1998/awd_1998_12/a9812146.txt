Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves mechanistic studies of the photolysis of organic
              guest molecules in beta-cyclodextrin hosts.  Reaction rates and products will
              be determined using a combination of x-ray crystallography, solid-state NMR,
              and GC/MS.

With this New award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program supports the collaborative research of Drs. John J. Stezowski and
              Gerard S. Harbison at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.   The research
              focuses on understanding the factors which determine the distribution of
              products formed in the solid state when molecules, known to react when they
              absorb ultraviolet light in solution, are exposed to radiation in a
              beta-cyclodextrin cavity in a solid matrix.   The work is expected to provide
              important insights into how organic reactions take place in solids, and how
              they differ from reactions in solution.   It should also provide valuable
              chemical training for both graduate and undergraduate students.
