Abstract    :
              Collaborative Project  OCE 98-11948  Wilson  OCE 98-12612  Harding    The
              recommended project involves funds for an extensive geophysical survey of
              oceanic crust in the south-central Cocos Plate region, in support of ODP
              Proposal 522-Pre.  This area of the ocean crust was formed by the fastest
              spreading rate ever documented by marine magnetic anomalies, with a spreading
              rate of about 200 mm/yr at the southern end of the Cocos-Pacific Plate boundary
              from 13-17 Ma.  The survey will measure the basic properties of oceanic crust
              formed at this extraordinary spreading rate.  Extrapolating observed and
              theoretical variations with spreading rate suggests that seismic layer 3 and
              the dike-gabbro transition may occur at a depth shallower than 1km.  Using
              multi-channel seismic reflection and ocean-bottom hydrophone siesmic
              refraction, the structure of the upper oceanic crust will be mapped at very
              high resolution.  Four specific areas will be targeted for detailed mapping as
              potential sites for future drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program.   ***
