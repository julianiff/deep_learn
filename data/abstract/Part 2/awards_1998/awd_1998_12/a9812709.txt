Abstract    :
              9812709  Hamrita  The goal of this proposed research is to develop and apply
              artificial intelligence pattern recognition techniques to the process data
              provided by Merck & Co. to detect the different phases of the fermentation,
              compare the obtained results with the expert knowledge of the process operator,
              and determine correlations between productivity and the process variables. 
              This research will look at fundamentally different control methods than those
              currently used in industry to try to overcome the problems of inaccurate
              models, the lack of reliable sensors, and the variable nature of fermentation
              processes.
