Abstract    :
              Investigators provide applicable theoretical basis for nonlinear wave-wave
              couplings in ionospheric HF heating, and apply the theory to experimental
              observations by Sulzer and Fejer in 1994.  They are deriving a set of general
              coupled mode equations for studying secondary parametric instabilities,
              including nonlinearities in the derivations.  Specifically, they:  (1) derive
              coupled mode equations, (2) compare different cases among nonlinear coupling
              terms, (3) perform case studies exemplifying the importance of each
              nonlinearity, and a systemic study of secondary parametric instabilities, (4)
              determine the spectral distribution of Langmuir waves in a specific frequency
              range, (5) study multiple scattering of cascading Langmuir waves by
              parametrically excited ion acoustic waves into forty-five degree off-resonance
              plasma lines, and (6) investigate possible direct parametric excitation of
              frequency upshifted HFPLs together with lower hybrid decay mode by parallel
              propagating Langmuir waves.
