Abstract    :
              This  Proposal is to support the RIDGE coordinating office at Oregon State
              University.  The RIDGE office is the focal point for the communications,
              planning and organization, and the day-to-day leadership that are essential to
              a successful coordinated, inter-disciplinary research program.  The most time
              consuming responsibility is program planning, coordination, and logistical
              support, which includes organizing and scheduling meetings and workshops,
              developing agendas and programs, editing, publishing, and distributing minutes
              and reports.
