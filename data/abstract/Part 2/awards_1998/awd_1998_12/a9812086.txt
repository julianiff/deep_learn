Abstract    :
              This project studies the benefits of combining two or more information retrieval
              schemes (data fusion). Methods are developed and tested using a large
              established test collection from the Text Retrieval conferences. The project is
              developing methods to predict when data fusion will be beneficial, and is
              developing methods that use non-linear rules of combination. The goal is to
              achieve a 15% relative improvement in the accuracy of predictions, and a 15%
              relative improvement in the effectiveness of the fused method. This project is
              motivated by the explosion of information in the World Wide Web, and includes
              development of specialized tests for comparing the new methods developed in
              this project to other "meta-search engines" already on the Web. For further
