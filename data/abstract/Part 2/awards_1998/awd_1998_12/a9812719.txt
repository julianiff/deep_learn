Abstract    :
              With this Prior award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the continuing research of Dr. Joseph Dinnocenzo in the Department of Chemistry
              of the University of Rochester.   The research focuses on the mechanisms of
              fragmentation  of organometallic radical cations containing Group 14 elements
              (Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb) in solutions containing nucleophiles.   A combination of
              kinetic and stereochemical experiments will be used to distinguish between
              concerted and stepwise addition/elimination mechanisms.

The proposed
              research involves fundamental studies of fragmentation reactions of positively
              charged,  odd-electron species containing C-M bonds, where M is silicon,
              germanium, tin or lead.   The results will provide insights into the
              structures, reactivities, and reaction mechanisms of these Group 14 cation
              radical intermediates, and are likely to be of broad interest to organic and
              physical chemists.   Intermediates of this type are likely to be useful for
              organic synthesis, and  may be involved in the formation of solid state
              materials such as silicon photoresists.   The work will provide excellent
              training for the personnel involved, two of whom are women.
