This U.S.-Mexico award will support a planning visit by Dr.
              Robert C. Vrijenhoek of Rutgers University to work with Dr. Guillermo
              Soberon-Chavez, director of the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores
              de Monterrey (ITESM-Guaymas, Mexico).  Together they will develop a cooperative
              research project on the molecular systematics, population genetics and
              conservation of Sonoran Desert fish.
Dr. Vrijenhoek is an expert on the
              genetics and ecology of freshwater fish from the Sonoran region of Mexico. 
              Studies of Sonoran topminnows in the genus Poeciliopsis reveal that these fish
              are excellent model organisms for a variety of field and experimental studies. 
              The planned collaboration will be surveying the status of populations in the
              Sonoran region to assess anthropogenic impacts due to stream diversion,
              canalization, and the introduction of exotic species.  In addition to this
              work, Dr. Vrijenhoek and Dr. Soberon plan to design a molecular population
              genetics and systematics laboratory in Guaymas that will be used by both U.S.
              and Mexican researchers for genetic analyses of regional fauna.
