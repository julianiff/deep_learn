Abstract    :
              Networks of workstations are poised to become low-cost  alternatives to
              massively parallel processors. Such  networked systems rely on high-performance
              router switches  that efficiently utilize available network bandwidth. 
              Irregularities in the distributed system owing to arbitrary  interconnection
              topology, disparate link length, variable  traffic demands (real-time, bursty,
              best-effort), etc., can  significantly complicate high-performance routing.
              This  project develops and implements efficient deadlock-free  adaptive routing
              techniques applicable to irregular  networks. Research activities being carried
              out under this  grant include (a) developing classification schemes for 
              irregular topologies useful for characterizing message  blocking/deadlock
              phenomena and evaluating performance, (b)  developing efficient deadlock-free
              routing algorithms  applicable to irregular NOW-type networks, and (3) 
              developing router switch architectures that maximize routing  adaptivity,
              minimize latency, and utilize bandwidth  efficiently over long and
              variable-length network links.
