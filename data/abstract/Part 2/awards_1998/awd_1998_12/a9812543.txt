Abstract    :
              9812543  Johnston  The Michigan Rural Systemic Initiative to Improve Science,
              Mathematics and Technical Education seeks to organize a consortium of two
              Native American academies and seventeen isolated, rural school districts
              throughout Michigan.  The consortium will develop an implementation proposal
              for systemic reform in science, mathematics and technology education, using
              electronic communications.    The goals and objectives of the proposal are to:
              (1) improve support for the development of a reform agenda for rural schools by
              forming new regional and statewide collaborations among the rural districts,
              MSU, NCREL, and other institutions or agencies; (2) to increase community and
              business involvement in the schools to support the rural agenda in mathematics,
              science and technology; (3) enhance the understanding of the rural communities
              and cultures by gathering base-line data from self-studies that examine the
              contextual variables within the communities and that support the reform agenda;
              (4) to generate a comprehensive and sustainable implementation plan for
              systemic reform in mathematics, science, and technology education that
              transcends levels, and addresses a local and regional vision, seeks a
              commitment to policy, fiscal and instructional reform, a comparison of
              programmatic strengths and weaknesses, a secure level of resources to promote
              change and an expedited reform through state and local policy changes.   
              Ultimately, the students will have more and improved opportunities to engage in
              learning experiences that reflects challenging and established standards and
              will exhibit increased levels of achievement on a variety of indicators.  This
              proposal aligns with the Michigan school improvement plan.
