The enhanced structural performance of buildings and bridges
              strengthened,
retrofitted and rehabilitated with advanced composite (carbon or
              glass
fiber-based) materials has been well demonstrated and the number of
              such
structures is rapidly increasing.  However, poor bonding
              quality,
particularly voids, in the adhesive interfaces between the
              reinforced
concrete (RC) structure and the composite material can
              significantly
degrade the structural integrity that could otherwise be
              obtainable by the
composite material.  In order to solve this problem, this
              research will
develop an electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology for assessing
              the
bonding condition in the interface between concrete and a
              composite
material.  Once the voids are detected, they can be corrected by
              injecting
adhesive epoxy at the time when the composite material is applied on
              the
structure.

The investigators of this research have completed a
              preliminary study
including development of EM image reconstruction algorithms
              and simulation,
which not only demonstrated the strong potential of the
              proposed technology
in detecting voids in the bonding interface, but also
              established a basis
for overcoming the major technical difficulties associated
              with the spatial
resolution and speed of assessment in this three-year study. 
              The major
research tasks include:  1) development of a prototype EM imaging
              device,
2) further development of the EM imaging reconstruction algorithms,
              3)
verification of the developed EM imaging technology by laboratory
              testing
on the bridge columns wrapped with composite jackets with well bonded
              and
poorly bonded interfaces, and 4) field tests for the effectiveness of
              the
developed EM imaging technology on bridges and buildings strengthened
              and
retrofitted with advanced composite
              materials.
