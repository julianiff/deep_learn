Abstract    :
              ECS-9812431  Spong    This proposal seeks support to hold a Workshop on New
              Directions on Control Engineering Education on the campus of the University of
              Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, September 20-22, 1998.  The purpose of the
              workshop is to bring together leaders from industry and leaders  in engineering
              education to identify the future needs in control education that will be
              necessitated by rapid advancements in control technology.    These advances are
              occurring at an ever increasing pace in sensor and actuator technology,
              microprocessor technology, and software, as well as in theory and in computer
              aided design methods.  The expected outcome of the workshop will be a set of
              recommendations to help NSF determine new initiatives that might be created to
              best stimulate useful changes in control engineering education.
