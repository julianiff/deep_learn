Abstract    :
                  9812573  Poland  In the current race to develop Performance-Based
              Engineering  (PBE) standards and procedures, one of the fundamental needs is 
              new and significantly improved analysis techniques that have been  tailored to
              use in design offices.  To be effective, they must by  analytically sound,
              scientifically defensible, and adaptable to  the intricacies of building
              design.  Some of the recent research  efforts were made to develop such
              techniques.  Unfortunately,  they have never found their way into common
              structural  engineering practices.  This project, a collaboration of  Degenkolb
              Engineers and the University of California-Berkeley,  intends to develop four
              new analysis techniques that meet the  needs of performance-based engineering
              as described in the  conceptual framework of Vision 2000, and in the process,
              adapt  sound research to structural engineering practice.    This project will
              complete the following tasks as their  contribution to the collaborated effort:
              Advise on the  development of the research plan, Compile a database of 
              buildings, Develop and maintain an analysis utilization matrix,  and Conduct
              calibration tests.    This project is a 3-year effort.  The first year will
              focus on  Tasks 1 and 2, while some work will be started on Tasks 3 and 4.  
              Years 2 and 3 will be focused almost entirely on tasks 3 and 4.    This is an
              award under the first round (FY'98) competition of the  joint CMS-INT
              initiative NSF 98-36 "US-Japan Cooperative Research  in Urban Earthquake
              Disaster Mitigation".  ***
