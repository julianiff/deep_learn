Abstract    :
                This proposal is for a workshop, SCICEX 2000, to define the scientific
              rational for the SCICEX program into the next century. The purpose is to garner
              the scientific community to develop the strategy for a mature, science-driven
              and well-coordinated program of science using Navy nuclear submarines under the
              Arctic Ocean. The purpose is also to interact with Navy representatives who
              would be in charge of the operations.
