Abstract    :
              EIA-9812623  Stine, Deborah D  National Academy of Sciences    Special Project: 
              On Being a Scholar in the Digital Age    This grant provides support for
              development of a guide for use by students and faculty which provides advice on
              issues in regard to the opportunities and implications of conducting research
              in a digital environment, digital age communications within the research
              community, and issues associated with new behavioral norms.  It addresses a
              number of points including use of digital libraries and databases, changing
              research apparatus, collaborative research, use of computation as a third
              research paradigm (along with theory and experimentation), communication of
              research, ethical issues, and career patterns.
