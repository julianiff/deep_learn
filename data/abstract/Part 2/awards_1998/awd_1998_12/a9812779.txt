Abstract    :
              9812779  Simon    Collection of the co-emergence of 13- and 17-year periodical
              cicadas    In 1998 there will be a joint emergence of the only two broods of
              13- and 17-year  cicadas whose ranges currently overlap.  This happens  only 
              once every   221  years, and  will  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to   study
               interactions  between  the two life-cycle-types  in  natural  populations. 
              Previous research by the principal investigator and co-workers has demonstrated
              that 13- and 17-year cicadas,  Magicicada  tredecim and   M.  septendecim, 
              have evolved as  distinct  evolutionary  units  or species  but that in an area
              of the midwestern United States  termed  "the anomalous zone" 17-year cicadas
              have permanently switched their life cycle to 13-years.  This
              life-cycle-switching has allowed genetic mixing between formerly isolated
              species and could lead to significant genetic changes in  the 13-year cicadas. 
              The 17-year cicadas will not be affected because the movement of genes goes
              only in one direction--from 17- to 13-year  cicadas via a four-year shortening
              of the 17-year life cycle.  In this project we will collect and observe 13- and
              17-year cicadas in their  zones of  overlap.  In addition, past studies have
              concentrated on  the  largest pair of 13- and 17-year cicadas, Magicicada
              tredecim and  M.  septendecim. There  are two smaller species pairs--
              Magicicada tredecassini/M.  cassini and  M. tredecula/M. septendecula--that
              have not been studied  in  detail and will provide replicates for comparison. 
              Periodical cicadas occur only  in  the  eastern U.S. east of the great plains. 
              Earlier  studies have identified  three  strong   genetic boundaries  where
              gene exchange may be occurring between life  cycles  and species.  We will
              collect specimens and study species interactions  in  the  field.   The most
              interesting  areas are those where 13- and 17-year cicadas  are  sympatric
              (Oklahoma)  or  parapatric (North Carolina, Eastern  Tennessee  and  North 
              Georgia).  One team will focus in the S W and the other in the SE; each will
              then work toward the Midwest.  The Midwest is extremely important because the
              "anomalous zone" had not been discovered the last time that Brood  XIX emerged,
               and  sampling  did  not  focus  on  the  most  important   areas.  Similarly, 
              when  Brood IV was sampled in 1981, it was not known  that  in 1985 13-year
              Brood XIX would emerge in the same trees in McCurtain  County, Oklahoma. 
              McCurtain County, Oklahoma, is the only area of the country where true 13- and
              17-year cicadas overlap.  By a stroke of  good luck, the exact locality where
              Brood IV and XIX were observed in  the same trees in 1981 and 1985--where the
              Little River crosses Hwy  259-lies in  the  heart of a US Fish and Wildlife
              Service (USFWS) refuge  that  was created  11  years  ago.   "The Little  River
               National  Wildlife  Refuge" comprises  12,000  acres  of mixed hardwood and
              pine  forests  and  should ensure  the future of the periodical cicadas in this
              area.  Another  focus for  collecting will be the area where 13-year Brood XIX
              overlaps  17-year Brood III in southeastern Iowa.  Last year 17-year Brood III
              was collected in  areas in which eggs scars of both Brood III (from 1980) and
              Brood  XIX (from  1985) had been found in the same trees.  In the spring of
              1998, collections will  be made of Brood XIX in this same area for comparison.
              Finally,  in North  Carolina,  eastern Tennessee and North Georgia, 13-year 
              Brood  XIX emerges  in close proximity to three 17-year Broods (II, VI, and/or 
              XIV).  It  is possible that formation of these four broods was  interrelated 
              and specimens collected this year in this area may shed light on this process. 
              In preparation for the joint emergence, five diverse genetic markers  were
              developed that can be used to explore hypotheses generated  by  previous
              research  in our lab. If successful, this research will  contribute to the
              growing body of evidence that hybridization between species is more common 
              than  previously recognized and can  significantly   influence  the genetics of
              evolving species.
