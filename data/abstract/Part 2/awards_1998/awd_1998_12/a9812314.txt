In vertebrates, the distal nephron of the kidney is the
              important site for the regulation of the levels of plasma sodium and potassium.
               In mammals, it is the site of reabsorption of sodium and secretion of
              potassium in the presence of pumps while in amphibia; passive mechanisms appear
              to be the means of control.  However, upon exposure of amphibian distal
              nephrons to potassium containing media, an increase in the number of
              maxi-channels was observed.   This is called potassium-adaptation.  The primary
              goal of this research is to examine how do distal nephron cells independently
              regulate cell volume and the need to secrete potassium into the urine to
              maintain homeostasis.  A molecular approach will be taken.  This research will
              greatly enhance our understanding of pot tation and related mechanism.
