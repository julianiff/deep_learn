This research grant is intended to support the archiving of
              data from the University of Wisconsin seismic data archive.  The request is
              brought about by the death of Professor Robert P. Meyer, in April of 1997.  The
              request is time-critical because space-pressures and tape deterioration are
              compromising large volumes of paper and digital data.  The latter are on raw
              field tapes and partially on processed 9-track tapes, with corresponding field
              and laboratory notebooks.  The data are gathered from tectonically interesting
              areas of South America, Italy, Africa and the U.S.  The data will be publicly
              available through the IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutes in Seismology)
              Data Management Center.  This grant is under the Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) program.
