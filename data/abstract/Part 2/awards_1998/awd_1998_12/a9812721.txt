Abstract    :
              The Los Angeles Vicinity Strong Motion Array consists of 80 strong ground
              motion-recording stations distributed throughout the metropolitan Los Angeles
              area.  During the 17 years of operation it has recorded many earthquakes of
              magnitude 3 and greater, including the 1994 Northridge (M = 6.7) earthquakes. 
              The recorded data provides a valuable resource for a variety of earthquake
              engineering applications.  The data recorded by the network is processed and
              made available to the public.

This action is for continued maintenance, and
              contingency funding for data processing in the event of an earthquake.
