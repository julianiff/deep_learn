Abstract    :
              	The goal of this project is to sequence the genome of Halobacterium, an
              extremely halophilic Archaeon, in its entirety and initiate functional genomic
              studies. The genome of Halobacterium NRC-1 contains a stable 2.0 Mbp circular
              chromosome and two large unstable plasmids, pNRC100 and pNRC200, 191 kb and 300
              kb, respectively. The justification for this project is:  (a) Halobacterium
              represents one of the best model Archaeal systems, with well-developed genetic
              methodologies such as genetic transformation and gene replacement and
              overexpression;  (b) Halobacterium represents a major physiological type
              (extreme halophile) of the Archaea;  (c) Halobacterium has many unique and
              unusual biochemical and cellular characteristics, including the light-driven
              proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, other retinal proteins, and salt-loving enzymes,
              etc.;  (d) Halobacterium has a genome that is the smallest among halophiles and
              has been extensively characterized by mapping and sequencing;  (e)
              Halobacterium has a genuine potential for biotechnology, for example in
              bioengineering of unusual characteristics for special applications (such as
              bacteriorhodopsin films for biological computers and programmed cell flotation
              for bioremediation), and as a host for production
of novel biological products
              (such as biodegradable plastics and recombinant proteins and enzymes); and  (f)
              Halobacterium exhibits salt tolerance that may be genetically transferable to
              crop plants. The majority of the DNA sequencing work will be conducted in the
              Hood lab at the University of Washington while most of the computational
              analysis of the sequence and functional genomics will be conducted in the
              DasSarma laboratory.  Resources will be shared between the two groups and the
              DNA sequence will be released to the scientific community, ensuring a dynamic
              project with significant long-term scientific impact.
