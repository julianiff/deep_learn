Abstract    :
              The motion of particles in non-Newtonian fluids will be numerically and
              experimentally investigated.  A suspension of non-linear elastic dumbbells is
              used to simulate viscoelastic fluids.  The dumbbells interact with macroscopic
              particles via relationships derived from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics.  
              The effect of changing various parameters on the multiple particle interaction
              and flow will be analyzed, including the relaxation time, shear thinning and
              inertia.  Various flow conditions, constitutive relationships, and typical
              applications will be simulated in order to obtain generic conclusions on the
              applicability of the method and its correlation with various physical flow
              systems.  Inter-dumbbell interactions will be calculated using the fast
              multipole method.  Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging will be applied to
              measure particle velocity and concentration in sedimenting suspensions and in
              Couette devices. 

The proposed numerical approach has applications to
              non-newtonian flows encountered in food and petroleum industries, polymeric
              flows, plastics and other materials processing.
