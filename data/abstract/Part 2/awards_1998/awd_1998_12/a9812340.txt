Abstract    :
              9812340  Larkin    This award is for the study of quantum fluctuations in 
              superconductors.  Of particular interest is the role of  quantum fluctuations
              in two-dimensional superconducting  films and Josephson junction arrays.  The
              PI's plan to  calculate the quantum corrections to the mean-field theory  of
              the transition temperature suppression in a continuous  disordered
              superconducting film. It is hoped that a  connection will be made to the
              scaling theory description of  the critical region around the quantum phase
              transition  point. Localization effects that occur for strong  superconducting
              fluctuations will be studied.  Motivated by  recent experiments in Josephson
              junction arrays, the PI's  aim to study phase transitions in systems of
              interacting  quantum vortices.  Investigations of the Hall effect and  vortex
              charge in two-dimensional Josephson arrays will also  be carried out.  %%%  Two
              PI's, one an eminent senior expert in the theory of  superconductivity and the
              other a rising star in the field  of mesoscopics will team up to study the role
              of quantum  mechanical fluctuation effects that are beyond the standard  (BCS)
              theory of superconductivity.  Phenomena assocated with  these effects are
              observed in experiments on superconducting  thin films and on arrays of
              superconducting grains or  islands, where neighboring grains are weakly coupled
              to each  other.  Research on these systems may give rise to new  electronic
              device technologies that exploit  superconductivity.  ***
