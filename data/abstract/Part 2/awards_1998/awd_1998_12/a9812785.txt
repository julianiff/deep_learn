Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS 981-2785    Keith A. Woodbury      This grant will partially
              support attendance at the 3rd International Conference on Inverse Problems to
              be held in the United States.  The major objective of the conference is to
              bring together researchers and contributors in the field of inverse problems. 
              There has been significant interaction between experts in inverse problems and
              in optimization, design and mathematics and the conference goal is to
              significantly increase this interaction, particularly by expanding the coverage
              to include topics in electromagnetics, vibrations/structural dynamics,
              materials processing and process design, optimization, and mathematics. 
              French, Russian, and Japanese researchers have made significant contributins in
              solver inverse problems in these areas.  This proposal requests support for
              travel and participant fees for American and Foreign experts in the field to
              achieve an interdisciplinary exchange of information.  The proceedings will be
              published and distributed internationally.
