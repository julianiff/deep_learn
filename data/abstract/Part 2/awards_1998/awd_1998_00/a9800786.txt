              ABSTRACT
Solomyak
     
The goal of this project is to investigate
              self-similar measures 
and sets, self-affine sets, and attractors of
              non-linear iterated 
function systems. The main emphasis is on the
              "overlapping" case 
when the symbolic coding is non-unique, and the closely
              related 
higher-dimensional non-conformal case. Hyperbolic and parabolic
              
systems will be considered. The topics include
dimension computation, the
              study of topological properties of 
attractors, and smoothness properties of
              natural measures on them. 
The methods of symbolic dynamics and ergodic
              theory, number theory 
and geometric measure theory, harmonic and complex
              analysis will 
be used.
     
Dynamical systems describe a wide range of
              phenomena,
such as the motion of planets and asteroids, the rise and fall of
              
populations, the weather, and the stock market. Many of these 
systems
              exhibit "chaotic" behavior and have "attractors" of 
intricate shapes and
              structure. This structure can often be 
explained by an underlying
              "self-similarity" which means that
the object looks similar at all scales. The
              "fractal dimension" 
of the attractor is one of the basic characteristics
              which can 
be used to distinguish systems of different nature.
Topological
              properties, such as connectedness and presence of 
the interior are also very
              important. We are still very
far from complete understanding of these complex
              objects, and this 
study aims to investigate them in a number of model cases.
              
Moreover, the theory developed for this is relevant in
other areas, such as
              computer image recognition.
