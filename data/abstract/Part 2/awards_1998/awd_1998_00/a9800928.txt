Abstract    :
              This research is investigating formal design and  verification techniques for
              advanced computing devices. The  techniques are based on formal verification
              methods as well  as formal testing methods that are well suited for 
              integration into realistic design cycles. The primary  concern is that these
              formal verification techniques scale  to larger problem sizes. The focus is on
              formally  characterizing: advanced pipelined processors; input/output  systems;
              and multiprocessor memory systems. Specific  projects include:  1. a protocol
              verification tool;  2. a tool for Presburger arithmetic based on
              model-checking;  3. proof decomposition methods for pipelined processors and 
              application of similar techniques for transaction processing  systems such as
              busses and I/O systems;  4. combined model-checking and architectural testing 
              techniques for industrial-scale designs of memory systems.
