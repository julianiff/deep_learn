Abstract    :
              ECS-9800130  Mohan    The objective of the proposed research is to develop
              battery charging methods which take into account the needs of the utility:
              unity power factor of operation, low electromagnetic interference (EMI), and
              high energy efficiency.  There should be electrical isolation between the
              utility source and the battery bank.  In addition, the usual requirements of
              high reliability, low cost and small size should also be met.    In view of the
              above requirements, two novel converter topologies are proposed as the basis
              for research.  Both of them make use of high-frequency transformers for
              isolation.  The first topology uses a single-stage rectifier to convert
              three-phase ac into regulated (controllable) de output.  The second topology is
              more general, for conversion from one dc voltage level to another.
