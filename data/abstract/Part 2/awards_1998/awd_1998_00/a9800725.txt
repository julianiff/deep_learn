Matzner
This proposal is to support the work of PI Prof. Richard
              Matzner, for a range of problems in classical gravity, including cosmology,
              black hole physics, and gravitational wave physics.  The work will be done
              utilizing a variety of analytical, approximate, and computational methods. 
              They will continue investigation of black hole interactions and the
              gravitational radiation produced in these interactions.  These interactions
              will be modeled using existing computer codes, and these codes will also be
              extended to describe the formation of black holes in cosmological settings. 
              

These black hole investigations are important cosmologically because it
              seems from astronomical observations that most or all galaxies contain a black
              hole within them.  Further, cosmological evidence shows that many or most
              galaxies have undergone merger, suggesting that their black holes may have
              merged.  There are planned experiments to detect gravitational radiation from
              spaceborne detectors, which would be sensitive to such mergers.  The same
              computational description will also apply to stellar-mass black hole systems,
              which may be the strongest signals first detected in the (ground based) LIGO
              detector, which is currently under construction.  Accurate prediction of
              expected gravitational waves allows a more precise search and, therefore,
              greater sensitivity in the observation of such signals.  Further, the
              understanding of these signals will have a direct connection to understanding
              the phenomena that caused them and will shed new light on the behavior of
              strong field gravity.
