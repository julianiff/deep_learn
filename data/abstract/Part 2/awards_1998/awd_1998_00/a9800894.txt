              ------------------------------- Message Contents
              -------------------------------  Here is the one page description of my
              research proposal which you requested.      The PI intends to study nonlinear
              elliptic and diffusion equations by   investigating the singularities their
              solutions may have. The particular   equations to be studied include Curve
              Shortening (and variations thereof)   Mean Curvature Flow, the Harmonic Map
              Flow, the Ricci Flow and the  Porous Medium Equation. The proposed method is to
              find formal asymptotic   expansions of solutions near their singularities, and
              then to devise analytical   methods to decide whether or not solutions with the
              found singularity types  can exist or not.    A good understanding of nonlinear
              diffusion equations and the singularities  of their solutions may lead to the
              resolutions of old problems in differential   geometry, as it has done in the
              past. Apart from this purely mathematical   interest, nonlinear diffusion
              equations appear in a wide range of science and   engineering contexts. E.g.
              the Porous Medium  Equation describes the flow  of a viscous material (like
              oil) through a porous medium (sand). So-   called "Curve Shortening " has been
              used both for enhancement and for   automated analysis of video images, and in
              particular medical MRI images.   A good understanding of nonlinear diffusion
              equations provides computer   scientists and engineers with a new set of
              mathematical operations which   they can use in image processing.
