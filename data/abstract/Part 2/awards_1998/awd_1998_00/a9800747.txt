This NSF-RUI grant will support the study of nuclear reactions
              by a faculty member at Hope College.  The study will by conducted by the
              faculty member and several undergraduate students (funded by the NSF-REU
              program).  This theoretical project will involve using model simulations of
              nuclear collisions to study the strong nuclear force.  Nucleus-nucleus
              collisions will be modelled and the evolution of the nucleons and produced
              particles during and after the collision will be observed.  The effects of the
              nuclear interaction on the final state of the system will be tested and the
              production, scattering and reabsorption of secondary particles will also be
              studied.  Both elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections of free
              particles can be measured in the laboratory.  However, in nuclear collisions,
              the particle-particle scattering is affected by the nuclear matter in which the
              particles exist.  Through model calculations the effects of nuclear matter on
              the scattering probabilities will be probed.  In addition, the model
              calculations will be tested to look for measurable signatures of the
              modification of the scattering cross-sections.
