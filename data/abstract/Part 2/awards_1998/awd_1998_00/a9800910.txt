Research on this project will involve the use of algebraic,
              geometric, and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions involving
              convex polytopes and their subdivisions.  Questions considered involve
              enumerative properties of general polytopes and arrangements of hyperplanes and
              structures on the set of all subdivisions.  A major focus will be to move
              closer to a characterization of the numbers of faces and chains of faces in
              polytopes and arrangements, as well as to obtain information on the structure
              of the set of all triangulations of a fixed point set.  The type of enumerative
              information being sought here has been of use in the design of geometric
              algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning, and recently has come
              into play in the analysis of randomization schemes for the management of data. 
              Questions involving the structure of all triangulations have been raised
              repeatedly in  a variety of practical settings, ranging from condensed matter
              physics to computer-aided design.

This research is in the area of
              combinatorics.  One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods
              for manipulating and enumerating discrete collections of objects.  The behavior
              of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications.  For
              example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
              systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete
              sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.
