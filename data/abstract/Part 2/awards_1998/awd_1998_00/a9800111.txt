This program addresses research in gravitational wave
              astronomy--the interpretation of gravitational wave observations that are
              anticipated to begin in the next several years--in addition to data analysis
              questions of direct relevance to the LIGO experimental gravitational wave
              detection effort.  It is anticipated that the latter research efforts will be
              carried out in the context of the LIGO Science Collaboration.  This research if
              of direct relevance to include development of:

	"science benchmarks" for the
              uniform assessment of alternative detector designs in terms of target
              science;

	techniques for generating extensible pseudo-random sequences with
              Gaussian statistics and a prescribed power spectral density that may include
              arbitrarily sharp spectral features (for simulating the Gaussian-stationary
              noise component of the LIGO receiver);

	diagnostics techniques for
              identifying and characterizing the statistical properties of non-Gaussian
              stationary and non-stationary instrumental noise,

	data analysis algorithms
              that exploit fully the information present in the correlated output of a
              network of independent gravitational wave detectors,
	
	data analysis
              algorithms for the identification of stochastic signals using maximum
              likelihood tests,

	data analysis algorithms capable of identifying burst
              sources or unknown origin, and

	Bayesian data analysis algorithms as
              alternatives to the Frequentist algorithms that have already been explored in
              the literature.

Gravitational wave astronomy research problems addressed
              here focus on

	source calculations for stochastic signals arising from
              non-exotic sources;

	interpretation of observations of generic burst sources
              in terms of astrophysical sources;

	the use of binary inspiral observations
              as a census of the distribution of component masses in compact binaries and as
              a yardstick by which the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters may
              be measured; and

	the use of gravitational wave observations in LIGO to test
              predictions of alternative theories of gravity regarding the "spin" of the
              graviton.
