Abstract    :
                   The Theoretical Advanced Study Institute for high  energy physics graduate
              study will be held for four weeks  each year in June/July at the University of
              Colorado,  Boulder during the period 1998-2002.  The Institute will  focus on
              one or two broad topics of theoretical elementary  particle physics every
              summer, the topics chosen being  timely both from the experimental and
              theoretical point of  view.  (The title for the 1998 TASI is `Neutrinos in
              Physics  and Astrophysics: from 10-33 to 10+17 cm`.  The topics  covered will
              include aspects of neutrino properties in  particle and astroparticle physics.)
               The annual program  consists of eight to ten lecture series, and several 
              seminars on topics of current interest.  Each lecture series  consists of five
              to six lectures, each of 75 minutes, all  allowing for questions from students.
               Each lecture series  starts with introductory material and ends with the
              current  status.       This summer program of graduate study is extremely 
              important to the education of our future elementary particle  physicists.  It
              complements in a very constructive way what  graduate students learn on their
              home campuses.
