Abstract    :
              9800129  Genereux    The goal of the short-term project proposed here is to
              establish and begin monitoring the first permanent, high-quality streamflow
              measurement sites at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, the
              best-studied (with respect to ecology) and best-equipped field research station
              in the rapidly disappearing lowland tropical rainforest of Central America. 
              The data will be used to:    produce the first high-quality hydrologic budgets
              for two small watersheds at La Selva (this aspect is time-sensitive, in that it
              relies on linking up with ongoing measurements of rainfall and ET which are
              being carried out by other researchers and are funded for a specific period of
              time)   test the hydrologic hypothesis, generated solely from geochemical data,
              that a significant portion of streamflow on one of the watersheds is the result
              of subsurface interbasin transfer of high-solute geothermal groundwater into
              the watershed  begin production of chemical budgets (input and output) for the
              watersheds, recognizing that part of the input is probably in the subsurface
              (we expect the hypothesis above concerning geothermal groundwater to be
              accepted)  begin preliminary, quantitative assessment of whether there are
              significant ecological differences that can be reliably attributed to
              hydrologic differences between the watersheds (this relies on ecological work
              being carried out by Catherine Pringle at the University of Georgia with
              separate funding).
