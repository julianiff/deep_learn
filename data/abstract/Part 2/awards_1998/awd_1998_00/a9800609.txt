Professor Chai will continue his study of the
              properties of linear subvarieties in the moduli space of principally polarized
              abelian varieties.  He will also consider the fine structure of the reduction
              of the Shimura varieties of PEL-type,.  This is a natural extension of his
              recent results on the density of ordinary Hecke orbits of Shimura varieties of
              PEL-type.  In a new direction of investigation, Professor Chai will try to
              apply the technique of l-adic cohomology to particular exponential sums that
              have arisen in recent work in graph theory.

This work in a modern area of
              Number Theory known as arithmetic algebraic geometry.  Number Theory is the
              study of the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc. and is the oldest branch of
              mathematics.  Just as the complicated name suggests, arithmetic algebraic
              geometry is a synthesis of three different areas of mathematics.  In the last
              fifty years, mathematicians have found that familiar objects from geometry,
              like the curves that appear as the graph of a polynomial equation, can be much
              better understood by viewing them as abstract algebraic constructions.  This
              powerful idea revolutionized geometry.  In time number theorists realized that
              many of their most difficult problems could be posed and then solved in terms
              of these abstract algebraic descriptions of geometric objects.  As often
              happens in mathematics, this ever increasing level of abstraction has actually
              produced many very concrete and practical results.
