Abstract    :
              ***  9800985  Franz  In 1995, at the request of the U.S. liaison Committee to 
              IUPAP (USLC), the President of the National Academy of  Sciences (NAS) issued
              an invitation to the IUPAP Executive  council to hold its 23rd General Assembly
              (GA) in the United  States, in conjunction with the centenary meeting of the 
              American Physical Society (APS) planned for March 22-26,  1999.  The dates for
              the meetings of both the IUPAP  Executive Council and General Assembly are
              March 16-21,  1999.  In 1996, the 23rd General Assembly accepted this 
              invitation and a National Organizing Committee (NOC) was  appointed by the NAS
              under the auspices of the USLC.  Financial and administrative responsibility
              has been  conferred on The American Physical Society (APS).  The GA  governs
              the affairs of IUPAP and meets once every three  years, the last having been
              held in Sweden in 1996.  The  U.S. has hosted the IUPAP GA in 1987, in
              Washington, DC.  The organizational and business work of the GA consists of 
              selection of officers, reports from the 22 disciplinary  commissions and
              affiliated commissions, officers and  committees, and action on proposed
              resolutions on policy  matters.  By associating the GA with the APS centenary, 
              additional fora, round tables and scientific sessions will  be provided for the
              delegates.  This will contribute to the  scientific vitality of the meeting and
              permit the  participants to interact with a much larger group of  colleagues
              than would normally be the case.  This meeting  will promote improved
              cooperation in physics research in the  U.S. and abroad, and will benefit the
              U.S. program.  ***
