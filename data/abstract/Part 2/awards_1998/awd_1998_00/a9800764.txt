Abstract    :
                This investigation allows the conduct of a national survey of voter
              characteristics during Thai parliamentary elections scheduled for May, 1998. 
              The elections have been called with very limited lead time and, to date, no
              studies such as this exist at the national level.  The timely announcement of
              scheduled elections represents a rare opportunity to examine voter attitudes in
              the context of a Thai election.  These elections will be the first held under a
              new constitution, adopted September 27, 1997.  This constitution makes
              significant changes in the system of elections and in the structures of
              representation in the Thai parliament.  Thus, the proposed study will establish
              a baseline of attitudes toward democracy that will be highly important for
              future scholarship, as well as providing a benchmark for retrospective studies
              of the previous electoral system.  The survey is conducted with the
              collaboration of four Thai universities, using a sampling framework developed
              by the principal investigator in an earlier study.  Questions are designed to
              measure levels of political interest, political knowledge, political efficacy,
              and political culture.  The study focuses on attitudes toward democratic
              institutions and rights under the new constitution as a basis for evaluating
              the status of Thai democracy.  The dataset to be gathered should be of value to
              other scholars interested in the topic.
