Abstract    :
              	Some properties (e.g., rest masses) of the mysterious neutrinos remain elusive.
               Discovery of these properties may well represent new physics beyond the
              Standard Model of particle physics and could give us insights into the
              evolution of the universe.  In part, little is known about these particles
              because they interact so weakly that conventional laboratory experiments are
              rarely definitive. Serendipidously, however, neutrinos and neutrino
              interactions with matter may play a dominant role in the synthesis of the light
              nuclei in the early universe and in the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in
              supernova explosions. To the extent that we can understand the nuclear physics
              of these astrophysical environments, we may be able to employ them (that is,
              their observed nucleosynthesis products) as neutrino physics "laboratories." 
              Conversely, new experimental insights into the properties of the neutrinos may
              allow us a better understanding of how nuclei were made in our universe.  This
              remains, afterall, a central problem of nuclear physics.  The work proposed
              here aims to exploit the symbiosis between neutrino physics and the
              nucleosynthesis of the light and heavy nuclei.  The goal of this work will be
              to make progress in understanding each of these issues.
