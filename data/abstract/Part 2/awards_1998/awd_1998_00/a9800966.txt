	In the macroscopic world of classical dynamics, chaos
              refers to an extreme sensitivity to the starting or initial condition.  When
              chaos is dominant important consequences, such as the equal likelihood of all
              distinct solutions, result.  These, in turn, revisit many unanswered questions
              in our understanding of the long-time behavior of statistical theories of
              nature.  Even this simple view of chaos does not carry over well to the
              microscopic or quantum world, which is dominated by wave effects.  Interference
              and diffraction effects suppress the classical sensitivity to initial
              conditions and result in preferred configurations.  Collectively referred to as
              quantum chaos, these effects multiply on including the feature that
              non-uniformities exist even in the classical description.  In general, chaotic
              and regular or stable regions coexist and the quantum consequences of this
              `mixed space' dynamics are poorly understood.  This regime is also pertinent to
              a recent, and unusual, confluence of experiments in a variety of novel
              contexts.  The proposed study continues with ongoing work on the
              characterization of the mixed space quantum coherences as well as a detailed
              analysis of their robustness to environmental noise.  The combination numerical
              and analytic method specifically targets atom optics as the experimental test
              bed for the findings.  It is anticipated that the findings will help clarify
              the conditions under which the classical and quantum descriptions can be
              reconciled.
