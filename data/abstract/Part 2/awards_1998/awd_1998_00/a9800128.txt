Abstract    :
                CMS 9800128  PI: L.S. Schadler  RPI    ABSTRACT    A  combined experimental
              and theoretical study of the  creep  fracture  in  unidirectional, graphite 
              fiber/polymer-matrix  composite materials in tension is conducted. Creep 
              fracture  is  important in various applications such as filament wound 
              pressure   vessels,  pultruded  rods  and  beams,   offshore  platform
              stabilizing cables and pipes, all of which  sustain  high   loads   for   long 
              times.  The  model   incorporates  micromechanical  and statistical failure 
              processes  in  the  composite, and yields probability distributions for
              strength  and  long-term lifetime. Micro-Raman Spectroscopy  (MRS)  is  used 
              to  study matrix creep and time-dependent  interfacial  debond  and slip
              phenomena at length scales closer to  fiber  diameter.  Fast comutational
              micromechanics  model  for  the  composite is developed that provides stress
              and displacement  fields  for  large random arrays of fiber breaks  and  break 
              clusters for use in large Monte Carlo  simulations. The  MRS  experiments  and
              computational model are interactively  used  to  interpret  experimental stress
              profiles as  they  change  over time.  ***
