Abstract    :
              GERSTEN, 98-00158      Gersten plans to continue his work on homological 
              invariants in geometric group theory.  He has   given both homological and
              cohomological characterizations  of hyperbolic groups and a homological
              characterization  of distortion of a subgroup of a group.  He plans  to use
              these invariants to study open questions  concerning Gromov's bounded
              cohomology, the word  problem for finitely presented groups, and the
              isomorphism  problem for hyperbolic groups, among others.      The area of
              geometric group theory uses the methods of  geometry to study symmetry.  This
              turns upside down  F. Klein's Erlanger Program of the 19th century,  which
              proposed studying a geometry by means of its  symmetries.  For example, in
              Klein's program the  geometry of the Euclidean plane would be studied  by means
              of its symmetries, whose generators are  rotations, reflections and parallel
              motions, whereas  in geometric group theory, one would study which properties 
              of the symmetries one could recover from Euclidean geometry, when one  ignores
              small-scale features and concentrates only on what  is visible to a distant
              observer.  It is a remarkable fact  that the word problem, which concerns 
              writing a computer program to decide when two symmetries  are the same when
              they are written in terms of generators,   depends only on the large-scale
              geometry.  The word problem is  a paradigm for a large class of problems which 
              can be studied by the methods of this area.
