Abstract    :
                          9800941  Shimozono      The proposed research project is a
              combinatorial and algebraic study of the category of finitely generated graded
              modules over the coordinate ring of the affine space of n by n complex
              matrices, which are supported in the closure of a nilpotent conjugacy class and
              afford a compatible action of the general linear group. The Grothendieck group
              of this category is generated by a distinguished family of modules, whose
              isotypic components have Poincare polynomials with marvelous combinatorial
              properties. This subject provides a beautiful example of the interplay among
              classical subjects such as the geometry of conjugacy classes,
              characteristic-free invariant theory, and the combinatorics of Young tableaux,
              and the modern representation theory of quantum groups and two-dimensional
              solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics.      This research is in the
              area of Algebraic Combinatorics, which is a discipline within mathematics which
              uses discrete structures and algorithms to analyze algebraic systems.  It has
              recently enjoyed rapid growth and unprecedented success, since symbolic
              computation can often be employed to help solve its problems.  This particular
              proposal has connections with physics, more specifically, with statistical
              mechanics.
