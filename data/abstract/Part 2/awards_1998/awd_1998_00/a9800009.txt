Abstract    :
               Bhaduri    9800009      This project involves both scientific issues as well as
              technical developments under one comprehensive project. From a scientific
              viewpoint, the project deals with synthesizing nanocrystalline ceramics and
              densifying them with an activated consolidation process such as microwave
              sintering. Nanocrystalline materials signify particulates with at least one
              dimension lOOnm (1nm  10-9 m) or less. These materials are expected to have
              altered physical and mechanical properties, provided they can be consolidated
              maintaining the nanocrystalline structure. However, this is a challenging job
              since densification occurs with concurrent grain growth. In this work,
              microwave sintering will be used as an activated consolidation process.
              Sintering schedule will be determined after measuring the high temperature
              dielectric properties of the powders.   The technical developments will be
              carried out under the GOALI program wherein a consortium of several local
              industries will be involved. These industries represent a wide variety of
              products from powder production to cutting tool development as well electronic
              materials. Widespread interactions are expected to take place among the
              partners.
