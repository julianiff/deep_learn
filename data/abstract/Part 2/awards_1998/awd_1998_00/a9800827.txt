Abstract    :
              ***  9800827  Thurmes  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will produce liquid crystals with negative birefringence, and liquid crystal
              mixtures with negative birefringence dispersion. The negative birefringence
              materials will be used to optimize liquid crystal mixtures' birefringence for
              liquid crystal displays.  Display fabrication with negative birefringence
              dispersion liquid crystals will give achromatic displays; that is, displays
              which are equally transmissive to lights of different wavelengths. There are
              many immediate ramifications of developing a liquid crystal with negative
              birefringence dispersion. For instance, liquid crystal shutters will no longer
              suffer from such severe chromatic disturbances, optical filters will be much
              more color-balanced and provide more free spectral range, polarization
              interference filters will need fewer stages and hence be less expensive while
              transmitting more light, and Fabry-Perot tunable filters can be made using
              liquid crystal SLMs.       The potential commercial applications of the
              improved performance characteristics described above will include liquid
              crystal shutters without chromatic disturbances, optical filters with more
              color balance and more spectral range, polarization interference filters,
              Fabry-Perot tunable filters.  ***
