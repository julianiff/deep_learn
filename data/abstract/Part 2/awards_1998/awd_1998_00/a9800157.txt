Abstract    :
              A  methodical  approach to elucidate  and  characterize  the  fundamental
              micromechanical fracture mechanisms  in  ductile  single   crystals  is 
              developed.  There  is  an  increasing  production of entire structural and
              electronic components in  single  crystal form to eliminate grain-boundary 
              flaws  and  enhance   high-temperature  performance.  The  features   of 
              stationary   crack  tip  field  that  lead  to  growth   are  identified.  The 
              effects  of  repeated  loading  cycles  on  stationary   crack   stress  and 
              deformation   fields   are  investigated.  The  stress  and deformation  fields
               near  a  growing crack are determined to create an overall picture of  how  
              failure  occurs  in  ductile  single  crystals.    The  experimental program
              uses the Moire Microscope while leading  and  second  order asymptotic analysis
              of a  single  crystal  elasto-plasticity   formulation   is   developed   for  
              the  theoretical analysis.
