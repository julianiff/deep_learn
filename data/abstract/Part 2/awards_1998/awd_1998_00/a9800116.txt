Abstract    :
                 The sensory system of touch is highly sensitive to skin  deformations during
              applied constant pressure or vibrational  stimuli.  It is not yet clear just
              how the activity of nerve cells  encode these micromechanical forces.  This
              project utilizes a  bioengineering approach with a novel preparation of an
              isolated  patch of skin, to precisely control the stiffness of the material 
              used for underlying support, the skin temperature, and variables  such as skin
              indentation, load, and frequency of a vibrotactile  point stimulus, while
              physiologically recording activity from  single nerve fibers. The tensile
              measurements are important  because skin in soft areas may respond quite
              differently from skin  over stiff areas, and result in quite different sensory 
              perceptions to exactly the same external stimulus.  These  experiments directly
              test the relative role of the physical  components of compressive and tensile
              stresses and strains, and  how these may be encoded in the neuronal activity.  
                Results will be important not only to the physiology of tactile  responses,
              but to understanding the perception of tactile stimuli,  and so will have
              impact on studies of neuronal coding in general,  on bioengineering studies of
              micromechanics of complex biological  tissues, and may have potential
              application in areas such as  tactile reading aids.
