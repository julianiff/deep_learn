This award provides funds to support a 4-month research visit
              by Dr. Gary Stacey, Department of Microbiology, University of Tennessee, for
              collaboration with Dr. Naoto Shibuya, Department of Biotechnology, National
              Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Japan.  These two collaborators
              will be engaged in comparative studies of plant reception of chitin
              oligosaccharides produced by infecting bacteria or fungi.  Chitin
              oligosaccharides (dp=7) released from fungal pathogens induce plant defense
              reactions in rice, while lipo-chitin oligosaccharides (dp=5) induce the
              development of a new plant organ, the nodule, in legumes during infection by
              rhizobia.  The former situation is pathogenic and the latter situation
              beneficial to the plant.  The collaborators propose that, with regard to plant
              chitin reception, these two systems share many common features.  In order to
              understand the perception and transduction of signals by plants, the
              researchers will study the detailed properties of the receptor molecules which
              perceive the microbe produced signal.

This project involves
              interdisciplinary collaboration between the PI, whose research has focused on
              legume-chitin recognition, and Dr. Shibuya, whose research has focused on
              rice-chitin recognition.  The visit supported by this award will allow a
              further comparison of the rice and soybean chitin binding proteins.  The
              project will be mutually beneficial because of the two-way exchanges of ideas,
              skills, and techniques planned by the researchers.
