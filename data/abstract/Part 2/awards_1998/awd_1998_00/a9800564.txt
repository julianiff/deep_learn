Abstract    :
              Chung-Yung Wu  Darrell Judge  John Caldwell  University of Southern California  
                 Drs. Wu, Judge, and Caldwell will continue a research program of laboratory
              measurements of temperature dependent photoabsorption cross sections of
              molecules of interest in the study of planetary atmospheres, comets, nebulae,
              and interstellar clouds.   Specifically they will measure temperature dependent
              cross sections of 1) the 4PG, the underlying forbidden transitions and the
              pseudo-continuum cross sections of carbon monoxide; 2) the extremely small
              photoabsorption cross sections of methane, carbon dioxide, and water near their
              respective absorption onsets; 3) the pressure effects on the absorbing molecule
              in the presence of the most abundant atmospheric molecules such as hydrogen,
              nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane; and 4) benzene and hydrogen sulfide.
