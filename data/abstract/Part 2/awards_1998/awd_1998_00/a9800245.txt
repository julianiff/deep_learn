Abstract    :
              A  methodical approach to elucidate and characterize the  fundamental
              micromechanical fracture mechanisms in ductile single  crystals is developed.
              There is an increasing production of  entire structural and electronic
              components in single crystal  form to eliminate grain-boundary flaws  and
              enhance high-  temperature performance. The features of stationary crack tip 
              field that lead to growth are identified. The effects of repeated  loading
              cycles on stationary crack stress and deformation fields  are investigated. The
              stress and deformation fields near a  growing crack are determined to create an
              overall picture of how  failure occurs in ductile single crystals. The 
              experimental program uses the Moire Microscope while leading and  second order
              asymptotic analysis of a single  crystal elasto-  plasticity formulation is
              developed for the  theoretical analysis.
