Abstract    :
              9800960  Nakano    This award supports work on problems in the representation
              and cohomology theory of algebraic groups and related structures.  These
              related structures include Lie algebras, infinitesimal group schemes, quantum
              groups, Schur algebras, symmetric groups and Hecke algebras.  Many of the
              problems reduce to studying the representation theory for certain
              finite-dimensional algebras.  These algebras are in general not semisimple so
              the fundamental representation questions involve determining the simple and
              projective modules, computing the composition factors of the projective
              modules, understanding the block theory and classifying the indecomposable
              modules.  The principal investigator will also work on the use of geometric
              methods in the representation/cohomology theory for these related structures.  
               The research supported concerns the representation theory of various algebraic
              objects including algebraic groups and Lie algebras.  Representation theory is
              an important method for determining the structure of these objects.  This work
              has implications for a number of areas of mathematics including ring theory,
              group theory, topology and the study of Lie algebras.
