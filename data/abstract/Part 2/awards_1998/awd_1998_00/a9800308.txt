Abstract    :
              CMS 9800308  PI: A. Pelegri  Rutgers U    ABSTRACT    An  Electronic Speckle
              Pattern Interferometry system  and  a  Tele-Microscope are acquired to study
              the onset of  intraply  delamination,  delamination growth  in  laminated 
              composite  structures,  evaluation  of shear  stresses  in  delaminated 
              composite   beams,  and  assessment  of  martensite   plates  orientation 
              during  ohase transformation  in  shape  memory  alloys.  These  investigations
              help in  understanding  scale  effects  in  testing  and  damage of composites,
               developing  scale laws such that data generated at subscale level can be  used
               to predict the behavior of full-scale components,  and  providing   insight  
              into  damage  initiation   and   phase  transformation   mechanisms.  
              Application   areas   include  electronic  packaging,  structronics, aerospace 
              structures,  and optical fibers.  ***
