Abstract    :
              9800887 SOLTIS  The flowering plant family Crassulaceae (the stonecrops) is
              large and diverse.  Many species are used as ornamentals.  Others are used as
              experimental organisms, especially in photosynthesis research.  Despite this
              interest, little is certain about the historical (phylogenetic) relationships
              among members of the Crassulaceae.  The challenge of obtaining robust
              reconstructions of these relationships tests the ability of scientists to
              resolve complex problems in plant biology.  Robust reconstructions should (for
              example) assist investigators who seek a biological context for the appearance
              of, and changes in, significant traits among these plants.   In this doctoral
              dissertation research, Douglas E. Soltis and student Mark E. Mort will
              reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among members of the Crassulaceae. 
              The reconstructions will be based primarily on data from molecular sequences,
              but will also use information from the morphology, anatomy, and physiology of
              the plants.  They will work intensively on the Crassulaceae of Macaronesia
              (Canary Islands), and especially on the Macaronesian genus Aeonium.  Aeonium 
              is chosen to test the idea that a single founding species on an island can
              rapidly give rise to many species, each differing profoundly from the parent
              and from each other in morphology, anatomy, physiology and ecology.  The
              research will evaluate the challenges to phylogeny reconstruction presented by
              this type of history in plants.  Principles learned from the Macaronesian work
              will be applied to efforts to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among
              the genera of Crassulaceae worldwide.
