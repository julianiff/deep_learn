Direct detection of gravitational radiation is expected
              just around the turn of the century.  A unified effort of modeling
              gravitational radiation sources, data analysis and instrumentation is
              imperative.  This research involves work whose main objective is to attack
              problems in connection with the simulation of one of the prime candidates in
              the detection of gravitational radiation by LIGO and VIRGO, namely the
              collision of two black holes.

The work will be based on a mixture of
              semi-analytical and numerical methods and address issues regarding both, the
              non-linear merger and linear ring-down stages of the coalescence.
