Abstract    :
              The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will administer NSF
              Project Showcase, an exhibition of research, products and findings from
              projects that have been supported by the Foundation's Division of Undergraduate
              Education and the Engineering Education and Centers Division.  Each of the
              projects will be presented by its Principal Investigator.      Project Showcase
              will take place at the ASEE Annual Conference in Seattle, Washington in June
              1998.  The exhibits will number 20 and will be held for one day, with follow-up
              "user groups" for a select group of PIs.        In addition to the showcase
              sessions, this effort will support a mini-plenary, "Crossing the Great Divide. 
              Can the Engineering Community Truly Collaborate with the Education Community?" 
              Participants will lead a discussion concerning efforts to get the engineering
              education community more actively involved in effective teacher enhancement and
              teacher preparation projects for K-12 education.
