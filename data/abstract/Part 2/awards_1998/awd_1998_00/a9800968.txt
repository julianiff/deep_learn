This U.S.-Slovene research project between John Perdew
              of Tulane University, New Orleans, and Ales Zupan of Jozef Stefan Institute,
              Ljubljana, will feature testing of a fully nonlocal spin density functional for
              the correlation energy in a many-body system, consistent with the Kohn-Sham
              spin density functional theory.  The intent is to go beyond generalized
              gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation of energy to achieve
              "chemical accuracy" for predicting properties of atoms, molecules and solids. 
              The new functional will be tested for a variety of systems, including solids
              such as simple and transition metals, covalent semiconductors, ionic crystals,
              hydrogen-bonded solids, and rare-gas crystals.  Properties to be predicted
              include structures at zero or non-zero pressure, lattice constants, and bulk
              moduli.  Results are expected to hone existing methodology for theoretical
              materials science and quantum chemistry.

This project in materials theory
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the United States and Central and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.
