Abstract    :
              With results from Ulysses, Wind and SOHO satellite missions, investigators have
              obtained a wealth of in-situ heliosphere and interstellar medium data.  This
              data leads to significant accuracy on determining:  (1) the heliosphere's size
              and shape, (2) the very local interstellar medium parameters, (3) physical
              processes in the interface region between the interstellar medium and
              heliosphere, and (4) the fractional acceleration of the interstellar ion
              population to high energies, creating the anomalous cosmic ray component. 
              Continuing to use this data, investigators are deriving a baseline parameter
              set for interstellar helium by using new data and more accurate models.  They
              are determining the fractional ionization of the local interstellar medium, the
              fraction of interstellar gas passing thorough the interface layer at the
              heliospheric boundary, and the input composition for pickup ions accelerated to
              higher energies, forming the anomalous component of cosmic rays.
