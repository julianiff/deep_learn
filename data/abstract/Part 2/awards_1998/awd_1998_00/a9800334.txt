              Contents, Structure, and Kinematics.    Our Galaxy's molecular interstellar
              medium is dominated by an annulus of dense gas about midway between the Sun and
              the Galactic Center.  This 5 kiloparsec ring also dominates the Milky Way star
              formation activity. Despite its obvious importance, the 5 kiloparsec ring has
              remained largely unexplored in recent years.  Dr. James Jackson and colleagues
              at Boston University and the University of Massachusetts will conduct a new
              molecular line survey, known as the Galactic Ring Survey.  The team will use
              the SEQUOIA multi-pixel array receiver on the Five Colleges Radio Astronomy
              Observatory 14-m telescope.  Analysis of the data should greatly improve our
              understanding of the contents, structure, and kinematics of the 5 kiloparsec
              ring.
