Abstract    :
              The primary focus of this work is on the theoretical design and  analysis of
              error-correcting codes. The Shannon bound puts limits  on the decoding
              capabilities of such a code, given its rate. The  fundamental goal of this
              research, with applications to different  areas of science and communication,
              is to design sequences of  codes that are asymptotically good (achieve the
              Shannon bound)  and have linear time encoding and decoding algorithms. 
              Recently,  linear time erasure codes have been designed based on the 
              construction of random graphs with well-defined structure.  The  novelty of the
              approach is that the ``intelligence'' is in the  structure of the random graph,
              and  ``naive'' algorithms are used to encode and decode.  The  proposed work
              starts with the same basic approach used for  erasure codes and attempts to
              extend it to the harder problem of  designing linear time asymptotically good
              error-correcting codes.
