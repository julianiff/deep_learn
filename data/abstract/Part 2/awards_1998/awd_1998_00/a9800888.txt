The principal investigator will focus on several
              
representative problems connected with partial differential 
equations
              arising in continuum and fluid mechanics.
The linear theory of the partial
              differential equations 
for light propagation in anisotropic crystals will be
              
developed in a direction that will be useful for the 
study of nonlinear
              media.  The theoretical problem requires 
the re-interpretation and
              elaboration of some of the 
existing  techniques.  The equations of motion for
              
geophysical flows interacting with fast gravity waves 
will be investigated.
               The quasigeostrophic limit of 
rotating shallow water waves will be linked to
              the 
life span of solutions to a rescaled version of the 
equation of motion.
               Connections with classical compressible 
fluid flow will be emphasized.  The
              problem of the growth 
and propagation of planar vorticity will be studied. 
              The 
eventual goal is to achieve a better understanding of
the interaction of
              vorticity waves with acoustical waves.

When intense light, such as a laser
              beam, passes through 
a crystal, the optical properties of the medium change
              
with the intensity.  The mathematical framework for 
these nonlinear optical
              phenomena will be examined with 
the eventual goal of understanding the
              threshold intensity 
for which nonlinear effects are important.  Geophysical
              flows 
involve the large-scale dynamics of the winds and currents of 
the
              earth oceans and atmospheres.  The influence of the 
earth's gravity on such
              flows will be assessed. Additionally, 
the manner in which vortical structures
              can spread within 
fluid flow will be examined.
