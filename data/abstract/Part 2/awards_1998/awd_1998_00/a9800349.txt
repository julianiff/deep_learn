Abstract    :
              DMI-9800349  Wang       Considerable effort has been made in the past to analyze
              and optimize the process control in injection molding at the level of machine
              parameters, process variables or even part quality, such as weight or
              thickness.  Numerous methods have been tried, but results all depend on
              specific material/mold configuration and on a particular molding machine, i.e.,
              the method is not generic.  No definitive correlation between any process
              variable and the part quality has been established.  Accordingly, system
              disturbances (e.g., uncontrollable material variation, machine-to-machine
              characteristics, etc.) still cannot be handled adaptively to ensure part
              quality. The objective of the research is to solve these problems by taking a
              novel three-pronged approach: (1) Determine the initial machine-setup condition
              based on rigorous process simulation rather than trial-and-error or ad-hoc
              experience; (2)  Develop and incorporate a physical model based on molding
              dynamics and incorporating basic material properties in the control loop for
              part quality to take care of any possible system disturbance; and (3)  Develop
              smart sensors and associated intelligence to monitor and control part quality
              on-line and adaptively without the need for elaborate and impractical
              instrumentation (e.g., flush-mounted pressure transducers in the cavity).      
              Successful completion of this project will have great impact on the injection
              molding industry in terms of ability to control product quality automatically
              and adaptively.
