Abstract    :
              9800821  Woo   This project will study locating objects without the line of
              sight amidst obstacles by means of an active tag.  Upon a wake-up signal which
              identifies the object of interest, the tag beacons.  The goal is to create an
              indoors global positioning system which is efficient, robust, and low-cost. The
              operating environment is assumed to be in a computer aided design format. 
              There are two challenging research issues:  (1) multiple paths of reflection;
              and (2) exponential growth of solutions as a function of the number of
              reflections. A mathematical structure involving prime numbers will be developed
              to enable efficient determination of the source location from the reflected
              signals.   If successful, this research will lead to the development of an
              indoors global positioning system with applications in warehouses, hospitals,
              and libraries where needed items are often misplaced.  On-line scheduling in
              factories, tracking of luggage at airports, locating personnel in office
              complexes may also become feasible with this technique.
