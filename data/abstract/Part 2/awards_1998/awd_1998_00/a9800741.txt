	Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will
              focus on (i) the phenomenology of supersymmetric theories, including the origin
              and pattern of particle masses, and (ii) the properties of orbitally- excited
              baryons.  Excited baryons are observed particles whose properties may shed
              light on our understanding of the theory of the strong nuclear force. 
              Supersymmetry is a leading candidate for the physics that may be discovered at
              the next generation of particle accelerators, and may explain many of the
              current mysteries in particle physics.
