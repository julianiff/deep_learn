Abstract    :
              U.S. National Committee on SCOPE  This award supports the National Academy of
              Sciences' management , through the U.S. National Committee for SCOPE, of U.S.
              participation in the Scientific Committee on Problems in the Environment
              (SCOPE), a committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
              SCOPE has the following objectives:  (1) to advance  knowledge of (a) the
              influence of humans on their environment and (b) the effects of environmental
              changes upon people, their health, and their welfare, particularly those
              influences and effects that are either global or are shared by several nations;
              and (2)  to serve as a council of scientists acting as a source of advice to
              governments and intergovernmental bodies on issues concerning the environment.
              This award provides for the U.S. scientists who serve on the U.S. National
              Committee for SCOPE, and supporting staff at NAS, to continue their involvement
              in the five broad international issues on which SCOPE currently focuses are: 
              sustainability, biogeochemical cycles, global change, ecosystems and
              biodiversity, and health and ecotoxicology.  A major thrust for the U.S.
              National Committee for the next several years is the linking of natural and
              social science components of environmental problems.
