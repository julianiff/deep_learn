Abstract    :
              9800555  Dalgarno    Dr. Dalgarno at Harvard University will direct a
              theoretical project to carry out quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate
              coefficients for rotational and vibrational energy transfer in collisions of
              hydrogen and helium atoms with molecular hydrogen.  These processes are
              critical to the interpretation of the red and infrared emission spectra of
              molecular hydrogen, and they control the cooling in a wide range of
              environments.  Similar calculations on collisions of hydrogen with carbon
              monoxide will be performed.   ***
