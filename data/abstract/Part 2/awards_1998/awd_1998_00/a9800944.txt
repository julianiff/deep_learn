Abstract    :
              9800944  Patton    Using molecular genetic techniques and field studies, the
              investigators will examine how historic and current ecological and demographic
              factors have influenced the evolutionary diversification of Neotoma fuscipes,
              the dusky-footed woodrat.  In two ecologically distinct regions, aspects of
              life history that affect the distribution of genetic variation within and among
              local populations will be studied.  The distribution of genetic diversity
              throughout the entire species range will also be investigated.  Studying both
              local and broad scale patterns of genetic variation will give unique insight
              into the diversification of this species and will add to understanding of the
              evolution of Californian biodiversity.  Data from this study will also help
              guide the management of several subspecies of N. fuscipes that have special
              conservation status.
