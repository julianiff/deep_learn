	Understanding the formation of matter in the universe
              requires a deep understanding of atomic nuclei.  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD),
              the relativistic field theory of quarks and gluons, is believed to be the
              underlying theory of the strong force and therefore of nuclei.  However, QCD is
              extremely complex and is largely unsolved at the low energies relevant for
              describing ordinary nuclei and their constituents.  Attacks on this problem
              from several perspectives are proposed.
	The "simplest" bound systems of the
              strong interaction are nucleons (protons and neutrons) and mesons, of which
              nuclei are composed.  A direct attack on solving QCD for these systems is being
              mounted using new light-front field theory techniques pioneered at Ohio State. 
              Finding quarks and gluons in ordinary nuclear phenomena is a great challenge. 
              A path from QCD to nuclei is being constructed using "effective field theory"
              methods, which provide equivalent, but tractable descriptions of QCD in terms
              of low-energy particles. Contact with experiment is made using relativistic
              descriptions of nuclear reactions and structure.  This work bridges the gap
              between nuclear phenomena and QCD by providing tools for the analysis of
              experiments, which then feed back to the further understanding of the nucleus
              and its substructure.
