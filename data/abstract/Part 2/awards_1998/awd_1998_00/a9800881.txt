              ************************************************************************************  ABSTRACT    Karl Rubin  Stanford  98 00881    This project involves the study of the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves. Elliptic curves play a central role in many parts of mathematics including its most applied areas.  The investigator is interested in how certain points appear on this curve, in particular those points that can be pinpointed using simple fractions.  Fractions involve the integer arithmetic we all learn in school, so these points embody the arithmetic aspect of the curve.  To get at this arithmetic,  Professor Rubin will use all the geometric and analytic information about elliptic curves available.    In one view, elliptic curves are shaped like the surface of a donut.  In this view, simpler curves are like the surface of a sphere, a donut without a hole, and more complicated curves are like the surface of a donut with several holes.  The arithmetical properties of the simple curves have been extensively studied since ancient times.  The more complicated curves have such a restrictive arithmetic structure that simply counting the points on one is a difficult research problem.  The one hole donuts are, however, just right. They have a rich and mysterious structure which this project will explore.  The insight gained from this project will guide mathematicians for a long time to come.
