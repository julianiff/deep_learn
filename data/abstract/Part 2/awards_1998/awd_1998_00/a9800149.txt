Abstract    :
                AST-9800149  Shapero    A report will be prepared by the National Research
              Council (NRC) that  will survey the progress made in the field of astronomy and
              astrophysics since the release of the a previous NRC study of the field, known
              as the "Bahcall" report.  The intent of the NRC is to examine the health and
              status of the field of astronomy and astrophysics, set forth priorities for
              scientific programs, and make recommendations for future progress in the field.
               The report will be published by the National Academy Press.     About once a
              decade, over the past forty years, an assessment of the progress in the field
              of astronomy and astrophysics has been conducted under the auspices of the
              National Research Council (NRC).  The most recent such study resulted in the
              report,  "The Decade of  Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics" (National
              Academy Press, 1991), which is also known as the Bahcall report.  John Bahcall
              was the chair of the group that prepared the report.   This report will be
              prepared in the same tradition.  Extensive contact with the astronomy and
              astrophysics community plays an essential role in the preparation of the survey
              reports.   There will be contact with the scientific community and input from
              the scientific community.  This will be achieved through mailing out
              information,  public policy sessions held at professional society meetings,
              Internet e-mail and web site access, and open meetings of subdisciplinary
              panels.    ***
