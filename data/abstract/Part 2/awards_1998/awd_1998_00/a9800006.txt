Abstract    :
                CMS 9800006  PI: P. Papadopoulos  UC Berkeley    ABSTRACT    A  combined 
              theoretical,  experimental,  and  computational  study of polycrystalline shape
              memory alloys in the presence  of  general  three  dimensional  stress  states 
              and  finite  kinematics   is   conducted  to  better   understand   their 
              uncertainty   in  stress  response  and  in   fatigue   life  prediction.   The
                mathematical  structure   of   continuum  thermoplasticity  is exploited for
              macroscopic  modeling  of  superelasticity and shape memory effect. Solid
              -solid  phase  transitions  are associated with yield-like functions  while 
              rate  type  constitutive equations are  postulated  for  the  evolution  of
              inelastic strain and hardening like variables.  The  stress response is derived
              from a specific free  energy  function  calculated as a weighted average of
              specific  free  energies  of  all  active  phases  plus  the  free  energies 
              associated  with  the  transformations  between  them.   The  systems  analyzed
              here have numerous important  applications  in   bioengineering   and  in  the 
              control   of   composite  intelligent structures.  ***
