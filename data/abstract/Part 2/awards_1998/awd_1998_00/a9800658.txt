Abstract    :
              The    difficulty   of   achieving   hand-crafted   semantic  representations 
              has limited the field of  natural  language  processing.  The field has yet to
              develop a clear  consensus  on guidelines for a computational lexicon that
              could provide  a  springboard for automated methods of lexical acquisition. 
              One of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy.  This is an effort
              to address polysemy with respect to verbs,  and  how  regular  extensions of 
              meaning  can  be  achieved  through  the  adjunction  of particular  syntactic 
              phrases.  Verb  classes  are seen as the key to making generalizations  about
              regular extensions of meanings.  This is an effort  to  continue  development 
              of  a  set  of  intersective  classes  compatible with the verb synonym set in
              WordNet,  with  more  syntactic  information  and  a  more  explicit  mapping  
              of  semantic  features to particular classes.   The  outcome  of  this  effort 
              will  be an explicit association  of  semantic  components and sets of
              syntactic frames to the 4000 verbs of  Levin,  and  a mapping of those verbs
              into existing  WordNet  senses.   Small transfer lexicons for English,  French,
               and  Portuguese using tree-adjoin grammars as the framework  will  be
              developed.
