Abstract    :
              9800897    Peckarsky    The abundance and community structure of freshwater
              invertebrates is often different in habitats with and without fish predators.
              Objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to test whether fish predators or
              some other physio-chemical property determines habitat suitability for two
              insect taxa in Rocky Mountain beaver ponds, 2) to examine if differences in
              habitat quality produce a source-sink dynamic, or, alternatively, if increased
              invertebrate densities in "fishless" patches are the results of selective
              recruitment, and 3) to determine if different habitats can largely be
              considered as isolated as in a situation for a metapopulation or if there is
              substantial movement among habitats. Proposed methodology will employ: 1)
              whole-pond manipulations of fish densities combined with physio-chemical
              characterization of ponds to determine the factor(s) that influence patch
              quality, 2) mesocosm and field experiments to determine dispersal behavior and
              fitness in each habitat type, 3) field surveys of insect and fish densities and
               oviposition rates in the two habitat types to test for the occurrence
              source-sink dynamics, and 4) a stable-isotope addition experiment to determine
              patterns of dispersal. Key contributions include an empirical test of
              source-sink models and examination of how dispersal interacts with processes in
              a patch to determine the dynamics of a population at a regional scale.
