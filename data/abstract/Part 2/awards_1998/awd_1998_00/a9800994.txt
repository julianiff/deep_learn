Abstract    :
              A growing standardized communications infrastucture, over which, agents
              belonging to different organizations can interact, is expected to raise the
              importance of automated negotiation among self-interested automated agents.
              This project investigates normative negotiation stratagies for agents,
              specifically: a) extending work on single contracts by investigating
              decommitments, penalties, etc. and their relationships to optimality; b)
              designing barganing protocals that lead to optimal contracts, and c) studying
              sequences of contracts among multiple agents, including the affects of changing
              the pace of decommitments, contingancy contracts, and more powerful contract
              types that reduce needs for backtracking. The results of these studies will be
              used to design a normative hybrid multi-agent search algorithm that repesents
              the best chice in a space of protocals where each dimension corresponds to a
              methodilogical tradeoff. Among other things, this work is expected to impact
              electronic commerce, including such aspects as the formation of dynamic
              alliances of small agile enterprises through dynamic automated contracting.
