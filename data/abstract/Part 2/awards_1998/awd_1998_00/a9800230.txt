Abstract    :
              Two major areas of study dealing with fundamental issues in friction and wear
              will be pursued in parallel: 1) stress-included material removal along atomic
              and molecular steps will be characterized using scanning probe microscopy for
              ceramic materials in corrosive flluids. Activation volumes and thermal
              activation energies for the fundamental dissolution processes will be
              determined and used in a systematic modeling effort. The results will be
              applied to chemo-mechanical polishing of silicon and silicon dioxide materials.
              2) transient electrical current ecxperiments for tribological probes will be
              carried out. They will be designed to provided information about the physics
              and chemistry of charge separartion, tribo-emission, and galvanic currents and
              their relation to adhesion forces and to fructioon, wear and lubricant
              degradation processes.***
