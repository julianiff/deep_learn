Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a new design technique that
              incorporates a class of reset controllers of which the Clegg integrator  is a
              prime example. This is accomplished by exploiting the specific reset nature of
              this unique nonlinearity. Initial research has yielded tight stability
              conditions for low-order reset systems and provides insight to pose an
              important stability conjecture. Besides studying this conjecture, performance
              and stability issues using integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) will be
              addressed and new reset rules within the framework of multi-modal switched
              systems will be developed.  Several industrial implementations of such reset
              controllers, where extensive simulations and experiments were used to verify
              stable operations, already exist. The impact of the proposed research will help
              to alleviate the need for such testing which is the main factor for the limited
              use of reset controllers in industry. Successful development and demonstration
              of reset controllers in high performance digital servo systems is likely to
              find great commercial interest, especially in data-storage peripherals.
