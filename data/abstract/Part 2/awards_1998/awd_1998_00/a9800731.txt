The goal of this project is to provide stable,
              accurate boundary conditions for the Cauchy evolution of black holes, while at
              the same time determining the radiation waveform.  The approach uses a fully
              tested 3-dimensional characteristic-evolution code for general relativity.  The
              code was developed by this group as part of the Binary Black Hole Grand
              Challenge Alliance.  The strategy for the boundary algorithm is
              Cauchy-characteristic matching, which carries out a global evolution using an
              interior Cauchy algorithm and an exterior characteristic algorithm, matched
              across a world-tube interface.  While neither of the two methods alone would
              cover the entire physical region of interest, they complement each other
              because they are applied where they are most appropriate - the Cauchy method
              near the sources and the characteristic method in the radiation
              zone.

General relativity, Einstein's reformulation of Newton's gravitational
              theory, predicts that accelerated masses produce gravitational waves analogous
              to the way charges produce electromagnetic waves or objects moving in a pond
              produce water waves.  The existence of gravitational waves has already been
              inferred from observations of the orbits of binary pulsars.  The LIGO
              observatories now under construction will be sensitive enough to detect
              directly gravitational waves from distant galaxies.  The goal of this project
              is to develop a method for calculating the properties of waves emitted when two
              black holes in a binary system inspiral and coalesce.  This is important for
              the success of LIGO.  Binary black holes are one of the prime sources of the
              waves, which LIGO is designed to detect.  The calculation is based upon a new
              computational approach to general relativity.
