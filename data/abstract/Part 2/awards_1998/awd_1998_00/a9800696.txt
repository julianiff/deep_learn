Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop an intelligent workbench for Computer
              Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), that will be used to explore research issues
              related to coordinated work. Promising information analysis and information
              visualization techniques are used to address such CSCW problem as: idea
              convergence difficulty, information overload, vocabulary difference, increased
              cognitive demand, and interface/display problems. Evaluation of the feasibility
              and effectiveness of these technological mixes is carefully performed in lab
              experiments. The results of this research will provide insights to designs for
              human-computer interaction and collaboration, with possible applications in
              groupware, digital libraries, and Internet searches. http://ai.bpa.arizona.edu
