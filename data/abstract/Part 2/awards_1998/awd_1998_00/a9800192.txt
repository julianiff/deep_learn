Abstract    :
              9800192 Al-Sheikhly This is an award to provide support for research on
              radiolytic dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls in sediment, oil and
              water by use of surfactants, buffers and sonication during the radiation
              process.  The specific objectives include finding the optimal conditions for
              use of ionizing radiation for decontamination of soil to prevent migration of
              contaminants from contaminated sites, decontamination of sediments to reduce
              their potential for pollution of coastal waters, treatment of contaminated
              water for industrial and domestic use, and for treatment of municipal and
              industrial wastewaters to avoid pollution of surface and groundwater.  The
              marine sediments to be used in this project are sediment standard reference
              materials obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
              collected from New York and Newark Bays and from the Patuxent River Naval Air
              Station.  Oil contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls will be obtained from
              the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company.  The research will be conducted using
              electron beam and gamma radiation capabilities at the University of Maryland
              and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Results of this
              research are expected to assist in determination of the conditions under which
              radiolysis is likely to be the most cost-effective process alone or in
              combination with other processes for decontamination of sediments contaminated
              by polychlorinated biphenyls and related organic contaminants of sediments,
              soil and water. This knowledge will assist in understanding radiation chemistry
              as it relates to uses of ionizing radiation in addressing environmental
              problems associated with polychlorinated biphenyls in soil, water and
              contaminated sediments and provide the scientific bases for engineering design
              of decontamination systems utilizing ionizing radiation.
