Abstract    :
              9800785  This proposal concerns links between programming language theory  and
              semantics and probabilistic computation, with applications to  security
              analysis. The proposed work is to develop an analysis of  cryptographic
              protocols based on programming languages, but using  the probabilistic
              techniques of cryptography. This is a departure  from most formal analyses  of
              cryptographic protocols, which treat cryptographic operations  as "black
              boxes". The proposed work will include the development  of a modal-typed,
              concurrent programming language for defining  communicating systems of
              probabilistic polynomial-time processes.  A novel property of the proposed
              language is the use of  probabilistic rather than nondeterministic scheduling 
              of processes. A related notion of observational equivalence for  sets of
              probabilistic processes will play a central role in  reasoning about this
              language and in its applications to security  analysis. The proposed research
              will develop methods for  reasoning about observational equivalence (or some 
              approximation to observational equivalence such as probabilistic  trace
              equivalence or bisimulation) and use these methods to  establish security
              properties of various protocols. The proposed  framework will provide a useful
              analysis tool for working  backwards from security properties of a protocol to
              derive  necessary properties of underlying encryption primitives.***
