Abstract    :
              CMS 9800548  PI: R.S. Lakes  U of Iowa    ABSTRACT    Composite  materials of
              high stiffness and  high  mechanical  damping  are  developed to enable damping
              of  vibrations  in  structures such as those in aircraft and automobiles over 
              a  wide  range  of  temperatures. The concept  of  hierarchical  solids that
              contain structural elements that themselves have  structure is used. Lessons
              learned from natural hierarchical  high   performance  materials  such  as  
              human   bone   are  incorporated   into   materials  development.   Results  
              of  analytical  study are used as starting points  for  topology  optimization.
