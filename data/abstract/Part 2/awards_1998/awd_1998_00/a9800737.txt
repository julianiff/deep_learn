The Cornell group will carry out fully
              three-dimensional simulations of the coalescence of binary black holes. 
              Important theoretical and algorithmic issues remain to be solved before
              successful simulations of compact binary mergers can be achieved.  The Cornell
              group expects to overcome most of these challenges in the next three years. 
              They will also perform fully relativistic simulations of mergers of binary
              neutron stars.  These simulations will share much of the code developed for
              merging black holes.

Gravitational wave forms from the final plunge and
              coalescence of black-hole and neutron-star binaries are primary targets for
              LIGO and other gravitational wave interferometers.  These wave forms can only
              be predicted by large-scale numerical computations.  If such simulated wave
              forms are to be made available to the LIGO community in a timely fashion, a
              significant effort to compute them must be continued now.  The Cornell group
              will collaborate with other researchers to tackle these important
              problems.
