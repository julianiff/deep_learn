Abstract    :
              9800433  Rabalais    This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will
               provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use  on R/V Pelican, a
              research vessel operated by LUMCON as part  of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System  research fleet. Specific instruments to be
              acquired include  a computer, a piston corer for seafloor sampling, a dual 
              path absorption and attenuation meter, a fluorometer, a  light sensor, and
              spare parts for the water sampling rosette  system and the acoustic doppler
              current profiler.  The  shared-used instrumentation supported here will assist 
              marine scientists conduct studies from R/V Pelican in the  Gulf of Mexico in
              1998 and in future years.
