Abstract    :
              Professor Wolpert will investigate questions about negatively curved space,
              especially shortest paths and high-energy oscillations.  The goal is to make
              new applications to problems in analytic number theory.  Geodesics on
              hyperbolic manifolds have special properties.  Professor Wolpert will continue
              his work with A. Basmajian on describing geodesics in hyperbolic surfaces and
              three-manifolds.  The spectrum of the modular group serves as a model case for
              the study of automorphic forms and even questions in Quantum Chaos.  The
              spectrum is a major subject of study in modern analytic number theory.  Several
              open questions including "uniqueness of quantum limits," "the spectral
              decomposition of nonarithmetic groups," and the Ramanujan-Peterson conjecture'
              are actually questions about the magnitude of certain expansion coefficients. 
              Professor will use discoveries made under a previous grant to establish new and
              better estimates of these coefficients.

This is research in the general area
              of number theory.  The historical roots of number theory are in the study of
              the whole numbers, considering questions of divisibility of one whole number by
              another.  Number theory is one of the oldest fields in mathematics and has at
              times guided the direction of the development of the entire field.  In current
              times it has served as an indispensable tool in computer science,
              communications, and electronic security.
