              Bruce Carney  University of North Carolina  FY 98: $40,171  For 24 months.   
              The RR Lyrae and Cepheid Variables Distance Scale.    Two of the most important
              "standard candles" in astronomy are the RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables.  They
              provide independent distance estimates for galaxies in the Local Group, which
              in turn provide the calibrations for methods that yield distance estimates for
              much more remote galaxies.  With this award Dr. Bruce Carney will complete a
              project with the goal of resolving differences in the distance scales derived
              on the basis of calibration of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables.  The data are in
              hand, but the data reduction needs to be completed, and the results need to be
              prepared for publication and distributed to the community.  ***
