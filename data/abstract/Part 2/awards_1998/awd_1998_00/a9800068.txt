Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9800068    Principal Investigator: Hui Cao    Title:
              Resonant tunneling into quantized exciton-polariton state in a 0D microcavity  
               Abstract    The proposed research is aimed at realizing a new type of light
              emitter which promises low threshold currents with high efficiencies.  The
              device utilizes a high-Q zero-dimensional (0D) microcavity and the
              hole-assisted electron resonant tunneling process to create the
              exciton-polariton states in the 0D microcavity. If successful, it may have
              great impact in creating a new class of low threshold light emitters that will
              enable future nano structures for optoelectronic devices and integrated
              circuits.
