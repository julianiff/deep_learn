Abstract    :
              9800028  Stubbs      The MACHO project uses the principle of gravitational
              microlensing to search for compact objects in the halo, disk, and bulge of our
              Galaxy.  The experiment has been acquiring data since 1992, at the Mt. Stromlo
              Observatory in Australia.  The main objective of the project is to detect
              and/or constrain the existence of compact objects (MACHOS) in the dark matter
              halo of our Galaxy.  The search to date has been very successful and has made
              important progress toward determining the nature of the Galaxy's dark matter
              halo.  Dr. Christopher Stubbs at the University of Washington and his
              colleagues will continue this project for another three year period.
