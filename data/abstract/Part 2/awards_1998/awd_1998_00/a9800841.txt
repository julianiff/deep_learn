Abstract    :
                As increased knowledge has been obtained about dynamics interactions among
              physical systems that are associated with climate variability and climate
              change, increased attention has focused on the need to increase understanding
              about the consequences of change on people and ecosystems.  To enhance that
              process, the agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program
              (USGCRP) have initiated a process that will result in a national assessment of
              the consequences of climate variability and change.  Seven workshops focusing
              on regional impacts were held earlier in 1997.  On November 12-14, 1997, a
              National Forum on the consequences of climate variability and change will be
              convened at the National Academy of Sciences.  This award provides support to
              the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, which is helping to
              conduct the National Forum.  More than 600 individuals are expected to
              participate in the National Forum.  The funding for this award has been
              provided by the U.S. Department of Energy on behalf of all USGCRP agencies. 
              The National Forum is a critical step in the process of conducting a national
              assessment of the consequences of climate variability and change by the end of
              1999.  The forum will continue a process that began with a series of regional
              workshops earlier in 1997, and it will accelerate the process of bringing
              scientists together with business leaders, government officials, and members of
              the general public, thereby enhancing the utility of scientific knowledge in
              service to society.
