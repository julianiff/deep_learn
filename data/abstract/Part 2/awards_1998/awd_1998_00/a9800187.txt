Abstract    :
               DMI-9800187  Newman  CAM-LEM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing of Laminated
              Engineering Materials) is a new manufacturing process constituting a
              next-generation advance in the field of Rapid Prototyping. The CAM-LEM process
              steps are:  analyze a CAD model in terms of contours of slice planes and in
              terms of surface tangents;  feed and laser-cut sheet tape-cast materials per
              the computed edge tangents; robotically extract the desired slice regions and
              stack them to assemble 3-D parts, interleaved with complementary shapes of
              fugitive material for temporary supports; and post-process to achieve
              lamination, binder burn-out, fugitive burn-out and sintering to full density.
              The objective of this investigation is to determine whether CAM-LEM can achieve
              the performance necessary to become a viable manufacturing process.  The
              investigation will identify and analyze the fundamental limits to CAM-LEM
              technology in terms of ultimate build speed, parts accuracy, maximum and
              minimum dimensions and aspect ratios achievable, and materials extensibility. 
              Design studies and simulations will lead to the construction of a fast,
              accurate and reliable machine for the realization of automated CAM-LEM.   If
              successful, this research will yield the enabling technology for the creation
              of a new, faster and more flexible manufacturing machine and process for direct
              fabrication of functional parts based on electronic descriptions.
