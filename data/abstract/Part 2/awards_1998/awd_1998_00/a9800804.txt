Abstract    :
              9800804  Rages    This project with James Kasting, PA State University,
              ATM-9714161, involves theoretical modeling of the effect of methane and CO2 ice
              clouds on Martian paleoclimate.  Early Mars appears to have been warm and wet,
              yet existing climate models, which assume a CO2-H2O atmosphere, have been
              unable to explain this. Preliminary calculations show that the addition of  ~1%
              CH4 to the Martian paleoatmosphere could have brought the mean global surface
              temperature above the freezing point of water early in the planet's history. 
              Most of the warming is caused by the absorption of incoming solar radiation at
              visible and near-infrared wavelengths.  Methane has a complex band structure in
              this wavelength region that needs to be accurately parameterized in order to do
              the climate calculation properly.  CO2 ice clouds also need to be included in
              the computer model to determine their effect on the planetary radiation
              balance.  Calculations with an atmospheric photochemical model suggest that a
              CH4 mixing ratio of 1% by volume could have been maintained if there was a
              source of methane at the Martian surface comparable in magnitude to the present
              biological flux of methane on Earth.  Such a source could, in principle, have
              been provided by methanogenic bacteria living on the surface of early Mars or
              within basaltic rocks.  The recent identification of possible fossilized
              bacteria in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 is entirely consistent with this
              scenario.  Finding a solution to the early Mars climate problem would help us
              to better understand Mars' history and may have implications for the prevalence
              of life on other planets both within and beyond our own solar system.    This
              project is jointly supported by the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, 
              Astronomy and  the  Directorate of  Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities.
