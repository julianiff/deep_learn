This project will involve theoretical research on various
              aspects of quantum field theory and its relationship to gravitational theory
              and cosmology.  Its central focus will be physical phenomena associated with
              quantum fluctuations.  Several specific topics have been selected for detailed
              study, some of which involve the gravitational field, and others of which
              involve nongravitational systems.  These topics include constraints on negative
              energy densities which derive from quantum field theory.  Such constraints
              impose severe restrictions on the use of negative energy to create exotic
              gravitational fields.  A second topic will be fluctuations of the stress tensor
              of quantized matter fields.  This is of interest both in the context of quantum
              fluctuations of the gravitational field and of the theory of van der Waals
              forces between solid bodies.  The quantum fluctuations of boundaries, including
              horizons, will also be subject to investigation.  Finally, some topics related
              to vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in flat spacetime will be
              examined.  These include the effects of such fluctuations on electron
              interference patterns, and the possibility of amplifying vacuum fluctuations in
              the context of van der Waals forces.

This research aims to understand more
              deeply some of the effects of quantum fluctuations in a variety of situations,
              and in particular, to understand aspects of the quantum nature of the
              gravitational field.
