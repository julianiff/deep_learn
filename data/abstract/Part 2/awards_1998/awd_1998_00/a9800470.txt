Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  
              Program, investigates the spatial dimension of surface reactions.  Using  
              scanning tunneling microscopy and UHV spectroscopic techniques, Professor  
              Reutt-Robey and her coworkers at the University of Maryland-College Park   are
              exploring self-diffusion events on metallic surfaces and the   interaction of
              these events with adsorption and reaction processes on   these surfaces. 
              Hydrogen adsorption on vicinal Al(111) surfaces is used   to probe stepped
              surface site distributions and adsorption driven step   motion and facetting. 
              Carbon-carbon coupling reactions of adsorbed   iodobenzene and propyliodide are
              monitored on the Ag(001) surface in   order to address the questions of
              reactant ordering and spatial   dependences of reaction probabilities.       In
              studies of the spatial dependence of surface reactions, Professor   Reutt-Robey
              is addressing the molecular mechanisms of heterogeneous   catalysis.  Using
              microscopic and spectroscopic approaches to these   questions, she is able to
              elucidate the detailed mechanisms of catalyst   step motion induced by reactant
              adsorption, and the effect of reactant   orientation on the likelihood of a
              particular reaction occurring.  The   information gained from these studies is
              useful in developing a detailed   understanding of the technologically
              important field of heterogeneous   catalysis.
