This work is an experiment to elucidate and exploit the
              hydrodynamic and electromagnetic mechanisms that account for sonoluminescence
              (SL).  The focus is on the observation of picosecond Thomson scattering from
              the bubble as a probe of the density of free electrons in the bubble.
