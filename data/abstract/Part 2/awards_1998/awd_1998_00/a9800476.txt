Abstract    :
              9800476  Simonetti    A High-Resolution, High-Sensitivity H-alpha and  SII 
              Survey of the Northern Galaxy.    The objective of this project is the
              production of two major imaging surveys of interstellar line emission from that
              part of the Galaxy visible from the northern hemisphere.  The first survey will
              consist of images of the faint hydrogen Balmer-alpha emission from the warm
              ionized interstellar medium over the northern celestial hemisphere.  The second
              survey will comprise images of the interstellar forbidden line emission of
              ionized sulfur, and will cover the northern Galaxy between latitudes of
              plus/minus 20 degrees.  The results of the surveys will be digital atlases
              available to the astronomical community.
