This research program was prepared in coordination
              with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), to address the need to understand
              the thermal background noise of laser interferometric gravitational wave
              receivers.  Its objectives are:  to develop a numerical algorithm and software
              to compute elastic Green's functions for arbitrarily shaped bodies made of
              anisotropic materials; and to apply the methodology to thermal noise
              estimations of gravitational wave receivers.

There are several other
              programs around the world aiming to detect astrophysical gravitational waves by
              laser interferometry.  Their basic idea is to measure the relative
              displacements of suspended mirrors (or test masses) induced by the passage of
              gravitational waves using a highly sensitive laser interferometer.  Thermally
              induced surface vibration of the mirror bodies is a major noise source in such
              a detector.  Understanding this important noise source is one of the crucial
              research areas of the LSC.  The ability to calculate the thermal noise for
              different test mass shapes and sizes should be developed.  Dr. Nakagawa has
              recently obtained a general formula and a computational scheme that enable
              accurate and efficient computations of thermally induced elastic vibrations of
              mirror objects.  The formula expresses thermal displacement fluctuations in
              terms of the two key quantities, i.e., complex elastic stiffness and elastic
              Green's function.  While there are several on-going experimental efforts toward
              determining elastic loss parameters, this focused effort is needed for
              numerical computation, particularly to deal with (1) arbitrary mirror shapes
              and (2) anisotropic materials.
