Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to characterize the fundamental processes by which
              speech sounds are  produced. Advances in speech technology are  hampered
              because of incomplete understanding of these processes. Current knowledge does
              not  successfully bridge the gap between classical approximation of speech as a
              linear acoustic  description, and a full compressible Navier-Stokes (NS)
              description, which includes not only the  sound propagation described in the
              linear model, but also the non-linear processes which produce the  sound.  To
              address this shortfall, the current research integrates three interrelated
              approaches for  obtaining a deeper understanding of speech production: (1)
              synthesis of speech sounds using a NS  solver, (2) experimental validation of
              the NS code through acoustic and fluid-dynamic measurements on  a physical
              model,  and (3) development and implementation of a reduced model of speech
              sound  production.  The expected result is speech synthesis of quality and
              naturalness surpassing that yet  achieved, and a new model for speech
              generation.  The results will lead to improved parameterizations  for speech
              synthesis, speech recognition, and low bit-rate transmission.
