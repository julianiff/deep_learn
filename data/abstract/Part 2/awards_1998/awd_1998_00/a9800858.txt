              Professors A.K. Ramdas and S. Rodriguez of  the  Department  of  Physics of
              Purdue University is  focused  on  the  investigation  of novel spectroscopic
              phenomena  exhibited  by  a  range  of  tetrahedrally coordinated
              semiconductors  which  share  common  features in their atomic architecture,
              lattice  dynamics,  and electronic band structures.  A rich program of
              investigations  will  be  pursued,  including the study  of  the  nature  of 
              the  electronic  states  of donor-bound electrons  and  acceptor-bound  holes 
              in  isotopically controlled diamonds, in  silicon  carbide  polytypes,  and  in
               II-VI  compound  semiconductors  by  Fourier  transform   infrared   (FTIR),  
              Raman,   and   photoluminescence  spectroscopy.  Also piezo- and
              magneto-spectroscopy will be  used  to   deduce  the  site  symmetry   of  the 
              impurity,   and   the  degeneracies,  deformation  potential  constants,  and 
              g-factors  characteristic   of   its  bound  states.    Further,   localized 
              vibrational  and  gap  modes  of  isoelectronic  and  compensated  impurities
              in II-VIs, I-III-VI2, and II-IV-V2 chalcopyrites  will  be  studied by FTIR as
              are the sp-d and d-d exchange interactions  as  revealed  in  the  magnetic 
              excitations  in  the  II-VI  and  chalcopyrite  based diluted magnetic
              semiconductors.   These  and  other  phenomena  and systems constitute a wide
              ranging  research  program  whose  contributions to various  areas  of 
              contemporary  solid  state  physics  and  materials science  will  aid  in  our
               understanding of the fundamental behavior of novel materials  and  assist in
              their incorporation in varied technological devices.  %%%  This  research by
