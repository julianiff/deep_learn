              Proposal: DMS-9800479  Principal Investigator: Bernard Shiffman    Abstract:
              Shiffman will continue his research on complex varieties and meromorphic
              mappings.  He will use techniques from his previous work on currents and
              Nevanlinna theory to study the dynamics of rational maps in several complex
              variables. His philosophy involves considering the sequence of iterates of a
              map and looking at the distribution of values for increasing numbers of
              iterations instead of for increasing radius, as would be the case in Nevanlinna
              theory. Shiffman will also apply some new techniques of value distribution
              theory and algebraic geometry to investigate uniqueness theorems in one complex
              variable, with a goal towards obtaining a better understanding of the concept
              of hyperbolicity for algebraic manifolds. He will continue to study the
              implications of his discovery that Polya's uniqueness theorem and some newer
              uniqueness results in one complex variable can be reformulated in terms of the
              relative hyperbolicity of certain quasi-projective surfaces.    Dynamics is the
              study of the time evolution of processes, which can be as simple as a damped
              pendulum or as complicated as the weather, governed by physical laws that can
              be mathematically formulated. The project is concerned primarily with
              non-linear systems; these are the systems that exhibit chaotic behavior, and
              understanding how chaotic systems behave is of fundamental importance in many
              areas of the biological and physical sciences, such as the study of turbulence
              of fluids, chemical reactions, and biological rhythms. Another component of the
              project involves understanding the geometry of complex algebraic manifolds,
              which play an important role in quantum field theory and provide models for
              diverse physical phenomena.
