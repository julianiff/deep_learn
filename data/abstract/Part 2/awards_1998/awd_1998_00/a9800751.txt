Abstract    :
              AST-9800751  Riemer    The CORF plays an essential role in defending the radio
              frequency interests of the U.S. scientific community before national and
              international organizations that deal with the allocation and efficient use of
              the radio spectrum.  A major CORF activity centers on participation in public
              pleadings before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding
              allocation and assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters. 
              During the past 3-years, covering the previous grant period, CORF filed
              comments before the FCC in matters related to the use of millimeter wavelength
              spectrum, preparations for WRC-95 and WRC-97, and other matters.  During the
              coming 3-year period, CORF is expected to comment on the U.S. proposals to
              WRC-99 and possibly WRC-01, to continue working with the FCC on issues related
              to millimeter wave spectrum use, and the impact on radio astronomy of spurious
              emissions from transmitters on board of satellites, among others.   ***
