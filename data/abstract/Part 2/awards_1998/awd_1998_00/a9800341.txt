              Chang-Hasnain    Title: Rapidly tunable integrated vertical cavity filters and
              attenuators for dynamically reconfigurable packet-switched WDM optical networks
                 Abstract      This proposal was submitted jointly with Willner of the
              University of Southern California.  The proposed research is to develop two key
              technologies to enable fast next generation all-optical packet-switched WDM
              optical networks. The technologies are fast tuning optical filters and
              attenuators based on the new GaInNAs material system lattice matched to GaAs in
              the 1.3 micron to 1.5 micron wavelength region.
