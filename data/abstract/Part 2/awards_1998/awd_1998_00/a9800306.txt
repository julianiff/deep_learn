Abstract    :
                        9800306  Brualdi    This award provides support for the Seventh
              Conference of the International Linear Algebra Society (ILAS) in June 1998. The
              purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers in linear algebra
              and matrix theory and researchers in other disciplines who make use of linear
              algebra and matrix theory in their work, for fruitful interaction and exchange
              of ideas. It is the seventh of a series of conferences of ILAS that have taken
              place in North America and Europe. Linear algebra provides important techniques
              for most scientific disciplines. This is partly due to the fact that in many
              applications, key problems are reformulated as a linear algebra problem. At the
              same time, many scientific disciplines provide motivation, insights, and
              problems for linear algebraists. Among the invited speakers are statisticians,
              electrical engineers, operations researchers, numerical analysts,  control
              theorists, and core linear algebraists. There will also be an emphasis at the
              conference on linear algebra curriculum issues and educational tools.      
              This conference is in the area of linear algebra. This is a field which
              originated in the nineteenth century as part of algebra. It is currently very
              active in view of its many applications and connections with other parts of
              mathematics as well as other scientific and technical disciplines.
