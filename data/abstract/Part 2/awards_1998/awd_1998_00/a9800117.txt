This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research on functional programming languages for sequential and parallel
              computing machines.  It involves Doran Wilde at the Brigham Young University
              and graduate students and Sanjay Rajopadhye at IRISA/INRIA (French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics) in Rennes,
              France.  The investigators will explore new methods and develop new tools for
              co-designing (or compiling) an algorithm to execute concurrently in
              reconfigurable hardware and in software.

The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in VLSI design, programming languages and compilers,
              and computer arithmetic.  This is complemented by the French researcher's
              expertise in regular algorithms, systems of recurrence equations, parallel
              processing systems and formal parallelization methods.  The project will
              advance understanding in the area of adaptive computing.
