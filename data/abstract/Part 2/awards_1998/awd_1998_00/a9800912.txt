Abstract    :
              9800912  Grimm  The PIs propose to investigate the effects of spatial structure
              on nutrient dynamics at different scales in a stream-riparian ecosystem.
              Streams are heterogeneous ecosystems that transport nutrients from terrestrial
              uplands to lakes, reservoirs, groundwater aquifers and estuaries. The extent to
              which nutrients are retained, transported, or transformed depends on the path
              of water through ecosystem components, or patches, and residence time in each
              patch. Preliminary results show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, nutrient
              concentrations in stream water are highly variable in space.  The PIs will
              describe the pattern of nutrient concentrations in stream surface water over a
              range of spatial scales, identify elements of ecosystem structure and
              associated processes that might explain these patterns at each scale, and
              develop a spatial structure-based simulation model to predict nutrient
              concentrations and nutrient retention as a function of spatial structure. The
              research will contribute to emerging ecological theory by examining how
              heterogeneity and the processes that cause it change with scale in a particular
              ecosystem. It will also aid in stream ecosystem management by increasing our
              understanding of nutrient dynamics in a desert stream catchment and by
              providing a simulation model for use in future ecosystem studies.
