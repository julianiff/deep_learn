Abstract    :
              This is a project to achieve a new level of technical functionality in systems
              for providing questionnaire surveys and their data over the World Wide Web. 
              The General Social Survey Data and Information Retrieval System (GSSDIRS) is a
              state-of-the-art, Web-based system for the documentation, analysis, and
              distribution of the General Social Survey (GSS) of the National Opinion
              Research Center, University of Chicago. With the exception of the US Census,
              the GSS is the most widely used source of data in the social sciences. The 21
              surveys conducted between 1972 and 1996 contain 2999 variables (1008 with
              trends) and 35,284 respondents.  One goal of the present project is to add the
              data collected in 1996 and 1998.        This work will also expand and improve
              the prototype GSSDIRS that was created in 1996. Improvements will be made to
              virtually all parts of the system and will include adding: 1) a variable
              shopping list, 2) super variables, 3) automatic customized codebooks, 4) an
              improved search engine, 5) enhanced on-line analysis, 6) more documentation,
              and 7) integration with related sites. GSSDIRS will also be reformatted to take
              advantages of the latest browser options.    GSSDIRS is the primary prototype
              system for building digital libraries of questionnaire survey data.  It
              demonstrates the feasibility of managing the great complexity of survey data,
              indexing and delivering questionnaire texts in varied formats and abstracts of
              publications based on particular items.  Linking more than one data-providing
              site to thousands of users around the world, it is the prime example of
              knowledge networking in the social sciences.  Given the wide use of surveys in
              science, education, business and government, the technology developed for
              GSSDIRS will be employed extensively in future years.
