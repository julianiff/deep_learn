Abstract    :
              
The objective of this research program is to develop a computationally
              efficient mathematical model for analyzing the permanent deformation of
              saturated soil structures during and following an earthquake.  This is a group
              research project involving principal investigators at the University of
              California-Davis and George Washington University.

The model is based on a
              finite deformation two-phase mixture theory.  It involves the improvement and
              implementation of an already-validated plasticity constitutive model into an
              existing finite element code.  The goal is to enhance the capability of this
              code to accurately predict the behavior of saturated soils prior to and during
              liquefaction.  The constitutive model is being extended to represent the
              behavior of granular soils, both at moderately high and at very low effective
              stresses, making it possible to simulate the behavior of soil prior to and
              during liquefaction.  This is achieved by considering the change of soil fabric
              as the soil approaches very low effective stresses.  The resulting
              finite-element model is used to study the mechanism of liquefaction-related
              large ground displacements, including the lateral spreading and settlement of
              saturated soil deposits.

Advancing the ability to predict the lateral
              spreading of soil foundations following strong ground shaking will be a
              significant contribution to mitigating the effects of earthquakes.
