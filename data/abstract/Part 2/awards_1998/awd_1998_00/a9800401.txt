Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9800401    Principal Investigator: Keren Bergman    Title:
              Optoelectronic node for novel WDM/TDM optical interconnection network   
              Abstract    This proposal was an attempt to effectively utilize the immense
              bandwidth of optical fiber interconnects and minimize the high cost of E/O and
              O/E conversion by design a network for optical implementation  that employs
              multiple node levels with a routing topology that has minimum logic at the
              node.  The network based on the Data Vortex architecture has the property that
              all self-routing decisions of the data packets are based on a single logic
              operation (AND) at each node. The PI claims that it can scale to interconnect
              an ultra-high performance computing system in a massively parallel form while
              maintaining low access latencies. The proposed work is to construct such
              network node in a testbed environment using high speed WDM/TDM payload and
              lower speed header. The data remain all optical throughout the network, only
              being converted to electronic format via fast PIN diodes at the receiver end.
