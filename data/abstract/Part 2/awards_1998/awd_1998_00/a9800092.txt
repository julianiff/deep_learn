The award on this proposal ("Short-Time Dynamics of Miscible
              Polymer Blends") supports a collaboration between the PI, co-PI Robert Colby,
              and graduate students from Penn State, and Dieter Richter of the Institute for
              Solid State Research at the National Research Center in J³lich, Germany, and
              George Fytas of the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser at the
              Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas in Heraklion, Greece.  The
              research will focus on the long-time dynamics of polymer blends which control
              the motion of entire chains effecting their viscosity and diffusion
              coefficients.  The ability to predict these features is critical to polymer
              processing, and is of significant interest to the community.  In order to
              achieve the goals of the proposed research it is necessary to develop
              collaborations to measure motions at length scales smaller than the whole
              polymer chain.  Both the German group, which is a world leader in quasielastic
              neutron scattering techniques, and the Greek group, which uses a complementary
              diagnostic tool, bring unique facilities and expertise to the collaboration.
