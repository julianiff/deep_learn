Abstract    :
               A synchronizing unit for a high speed camera system and pulsed laser to work in
              conjunction with an existing rotating mirror type high speed camera are
              acquired.  A continuous laser light source is also acquired along with a
              modified optical system employing magnifying optics.  The combined apparatus is
              used to investigate dynamic fracture effects in composites and functionally
              gradient materials and to visualize dynamic fiber pull-out and push-out using
              the modified optics.
