Abstract    :
              DMI-9800434  Lin  Integrated mesoscopic electro-mechanical manufacturing is a
              critical issue in design and manufacturing of sensors and actuators. Mesoscopic
              mechanical structures (100 micrometers to a few millimeters) are bridges
              between the macroscopic systems such as "mechatronics systems" and the
              microscopic systems such as "microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)." Although
              numerous processes have been demonstrated for the manufacturing of mechatronics
              systems and MEMS, very few of them have addressed the issues of integrated
              mesoscopic electro-mechanical manufacturing. The objectives of this project are
              to: (1) Develop a batch manufacturing process for mesoscopic mechanical
              structures, and (2) Integrate mesoscopic mechanical components with
              microelectronics. Several key processes will be established to achieve these
              objectives, including fabrication of precision mold insert, sacrificial layer
              replication, replication of structural layer, and final electro-mechanical
              integration.   The research will likely lead to new knowledge and techniques
              which are important to the design and manufacturing of integrated sensors and
              actuators in the mesoscopic range.
