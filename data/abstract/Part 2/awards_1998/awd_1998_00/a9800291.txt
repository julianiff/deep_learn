Abstract    :
              9800291  Dove    "Rational Design of Geomembrane Surface Texture for 
              Infrastructure  Applications"    Geomembranes are manufactured materials that
              are ubiquitous  in civil  infrastructure development and rehabilitation.  They
              are  thin sheets of  polymer used to construct relatively impervious barriers
              to  fluid flow.   Designs that incorporate geomembranes typically involve 
              creation of a  composite material composed of alternating layers of 
              geotextiles  (polymer fabrics), and soils ranging in size from gravel to  clay.
               To  achieve improved interface shear resistance, geomembranes  are 
              manufactured with a vast range of roughness and surface  texture  patterns. 
              The relationship between surface texture and  interfacial  shear strength is
              not well understood and there is  considerable debate  in the professional
              community regarding what form of surface  texturing  provides the best
              performance for specific applications.    This research is a GOALI award, with
              the collaborative  university-industry research aimed at developing a method to
               design  optimal geomembrane surface textures for use in civil  infrastructure 
              applications.  The research will involve experimental  surface analysis, 
              interface shear testing using granular soils, and mechanical  property  testing
              of a range of prototype and production geomembranes.  The  experimental results
              will be used to quantify optimal  texture  characteristics and methods for
              specific end-use design.    Development of methodologies for design of
              geomembrane  surfaces for  specific applications and for specific material
              combinations  without  sacrificing mechanical performance is an important 
              contribution to  infrastructure construction and rehabilitation.  ***
