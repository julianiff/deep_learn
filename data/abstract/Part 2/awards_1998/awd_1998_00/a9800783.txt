Abstract    :
              Proposal: DMS-9800783  Principal Investigator: Duong Phong    Abstract: The
              influence of mathematical analysis has increased considerably over the last few
              decades. However, the field is at an important new juncture, where analytical
              methods have to be blended with techniques and insights from other fields, most
              particularly geometry, probability, and theoretical physics. This is a
              recurrent feature in the proposal. More specifically, the proposal addresses
              issues of bounds and stability for oscillatory integrals, regularity of Radon
              transforms and degenerate Fourier integral operators, asymptotic behavior of
              Green's functions, exact solutions of supersymmetric field and string theories,
              Hamiltonian theory of solitons and non-linear WKB methods.      These are
              arguably among the most pressing problems in mathematics and theoretical
              physics today. Oscillatory integrals are, for example, a well-known feature of
              any physical scattering process, and progress along the lines suggested here
              can reduce greatly the extensive effort presently required for their numerical
              studies. On the other hand, the problems in the proposal concerning
              supersymmetric theories reflect very recent advances, indicating a deep and
              surprising correspondence between three seemingly different fields - namely,
              supersymmetric gauge theories, soliton equations, and Riemann surfaces. The
              origin of this correspondence is still mysterious, and it may well be essential
              to on-going attempts at understanding the laws of nature at their most
              fundamental level.
