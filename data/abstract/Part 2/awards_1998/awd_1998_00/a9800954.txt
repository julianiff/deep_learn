Abstract    :
              ***  9800954  Micheels    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will develop a field portable prototype nitrogen dioxide gas monitor
              based on photoacoustic detection.  Phase I produced a photoacoustic gas monitor
              design that will be refined and optimized in a prototype nitrogen dioxide
              analyzer with improved detection sensitivity and calibration stability
              integrated into a field portable package.  The portable nitrogen dioxide
              monitor will have a detection range of 25 ppb - 50 ppm with a response time
              under 30 seconds.  The instrument is expected to have cost and portability
              advantages relative to chemiluminescence-based monitors, greater detection
              sensitivity relative to the electrochemical monitors, and greater selectivity
              relative to both of these analyzer technologies.    The portable photoacoustic
              nitrogen dioxide monitor is expected to find commercial applications in several
              areas including industrial hygiene monitoring in leaks and emissions from
              chemical plants and fossil fuel combustion in confined spaces; air quality
              monitoring in urban areas; and contamination monitoring in nitrogen oxide
              inhaled for medical treatments.  ***
