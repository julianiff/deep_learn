Abstract    :
              9800561  Engel  The  construction industry can benefit from  the  novel  FRP 
              architectures and structures that result from  the  flexible  manufacturing  
              processes  associated  with  the   composite  manufacturing  industries. 
              Certain methods,  like  filament  winding,  pultrusion and fiber placement lend
              themselves  to  the   production of grid or cage structures  that  are  well 
              suited  as reinforcements in beams and columns.  The project  goal  is  to
              extend the previous work of a Small  Grant  for  Exploratory Research (SGER)
              wherein 2-D grids were designed,  manufactured  and  tested  in an effort  to 
              understand  the  effect  of joint architecture on the ability of the grid  to 
              transmit load.  Various architectures with different degrees  of
              interconnectivity between layers and between longitudinal  and transverse grid
              elements were manufactured and tested in  concrete  via pullout tests as well
              as bending tests.   That  initial work will be extended to investigate the
              effects  of  other  design  parameters,  in particular  combined  loading 
              (flexure  and shear) with emphasis shifting from grid  joint  architecture to
              overall grid structure.    The investigation will include the following tasks: 
                      Task  1:  Development  of  design  procedures  for  2-  dimensional 
              grid reinforced beams subjected to flexure  and  shear.            Task   2:  
              Development   of   2-dimensional    grid  configurations to resist flexure and
              shear.          Task  3: Identification and implementation of a  field  trial
              of FRP grid reinforcement.         Task 4: Three dimensional grids will be
              formed from the  2-D  grids,  and 3-D grids will be produced as a  continuous 
              cage.    The  education  plan  focuses on establishing  an  FRP  grid 
              database,   and   encouraging  composite  manufacturers   to  continue  their 
              development of  products  relevant  to  the  reinforced concrete industry.  ***
