Abstract    :
              9800102  Chappell    This U. S.-Mexico award will support a symposium on plant 
              biochemistry and molecular biology, to be held March 15-18,  1998 in
              Guanajuato, Mexico.  The support will fund travel  and related expenses for a
              group of US scientists,  postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students to
              discuss  research topics and technologies of mutual interest to US  and Mexican
              plant scientists.  Organizers are Dr. Joseph  Chappell, University of Kentucky,
              Dr. Ann Hirsch, UCLA and  Dr. Clarence Ryan, Washington State University in 
              collaboration with Dr. Alfredo Herrera, National Polytechnic  Institute (IPN),
              Mexico.    The objectives are to bring together U.S. and Mexican  scientists to
              discuss multidisciplinary efforts in plant  physiology, biochemistry and
              molecular biology, that may  lead to biotechnological applications in
              agriculture.Topics  to be discussed in the conference include plant development
               and signal transduction, plant-environment interactions,  metabolic processes
              in plants, plant cell biology and novel  strategies for crop improvement.  
              These topics are  significant, not only for their scientific importance, but 
              also for their potential to promote longlasting interactions  between U.S. and
              Mexican scientists.  ***
