Abstract    :
                        9800807  Shokurov      This award support a project  of Professors
              Shokurov and Kachi. The project is focused on problems in the Log Minimal Model
              Program (LMMP) in higher dimensions, mainly, on the existence of the log flips
              in dimension 4 and higher. The aim is to obtain such flips inductively from the
              LMMP itself and some terminations in lower dimensions.  In particular, the aim
              is to construct the log flips and even to complete the LMMP in dimension 4. In
              addition, a geometric description of flips in families will be given. Shokurov
              and Kachi will also start to investigate needed terminations and to demonstrate
              further applications of the LMMP.         This is research in the field of
              algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
              quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
              plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space
              by the simplest geometric constructions, e. g., conic sections. Traditionally,
              the field interacts with most of branches of mathematics. Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis, topology and
              mathematical physics, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as
              well as in number theory, physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
