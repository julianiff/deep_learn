Ernst
The recent discovery by Neugebauer and Meinel of an exact
              global solution of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein field equations
              corresponding to a rigidly rotating disk of dust has created renewed interest
              in solving problems related to spinning perfect fluid bodies.  Dr. Ernst and
              Dr. Hauser will apply their homogeneous Hilbert problem (HHP) technology to the
              matching problem to which consideration of stationary axisymmetric spinning
              sources gives rise.

With the objective of identifying some useful
              relativistic analog of the rotating homogeneous Maclaurin ellipsoids of
              Newtonian theory, Dr. Ernst and Dr. Hauser will investigate the variation of
              the fluid solutions with certain constraints [e.g., maintaining a certain
              equation of state].  In particular, they will investigate those variations that
              preserve the existence of an exterior solution that is asymptotically flat and
              singularity-free.
