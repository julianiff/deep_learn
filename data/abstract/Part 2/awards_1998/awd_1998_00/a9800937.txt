Abstract    :
              ***  9800937  Rosenthal  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a new prototype multichannel controller for a six
              degree-of-freedom (DOF) vibration isolation table.  The new table will mitigate
              vibration in advanced submicron line-width semiconductor production and
              metrology machinery.  The controller will apply a new method for multi-channel
              active control to the active control of vibration.  Available vibration control
              tables, while adequate for vibration control in today's semiconductor
              production and measuring equipment, will be inadequate for emerging
              semiconductor technology, in which six-DOF table vibration must be controlled
              to much lower levels of vibration.  Existing six-DOF systems control each
              channel of motion independently on the unlikely assumption that, unless
              collocated, actuators and error sensors are decoupled from each other.  As a
              result, existing tables tend to become unstable and to have limited vibration
              control performance.  A new algorithm avoids these difficulties by permitting
              unified control of several channels of reference sensors and table motions. 
              The new controller will extend signal separation technology that is now
              opertional in a multi-channel noise canceller.  Commercial applications are
              expected in industries requiring a high degree of vibration isolation in
              sensitive electronics fabrication operations.  In particular, operations in
              deep ultraviolet and X-ray lithography, semiconductor critical dimension and
              defect metrology, and atomic force and electron microscopy are targeted for
              this new vibration isolation technology.  ***
