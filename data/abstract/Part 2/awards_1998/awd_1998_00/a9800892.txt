Abstract    :
                Cox-Foster  IBN-9800892      Insect hosts and their parasites are valuable
              study systems, research from  which contributes to invertebrate physiology,
              basic ecology and evolution,  and pest management alternatives. Certain groups
              of parasitic wasps attack  specific caterpillar hosts. They are protected from
              the normal host immune  response by polydnaviruses, whose mode of action is not
              well understood  physiologically or evolutionarily. This study hypothesizes
              that  polydnavirus mechanisms are different among wasp groups, and that points
              of  divergence can be identified by comparing results of biological assays for 
              interspecific protection with physiological assays of host response to 
              polydnavirus. The proposed project will allow comparison of physiological 
              responses to virus from other parasitic wasps of differing relatedness, and 
              ask if the mechanism we previously described in one group is the same or 
              different. Additionally, work allowing direct comparison of viral DNA will  be
              initiated. Results from the proposed project will provide important 
              contributions to: 1.) understanding the immune physiology of 
              polydnavirus-mediated host/parasite relationships, and 2.) determining the 
              impact of divergent polydnavirus evolution on wasp success and long-term 
              evolution. The results of the proposed study are also relevant to  biological
              control since physiological parameters used may be useful  predictors of host
              range.
