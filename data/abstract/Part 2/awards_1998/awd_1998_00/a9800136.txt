Abstract    :
              9800136  Bergman  This   award   focuses  upon  the  dynamics,   control   and 
              reliability  of short span highway bridges,  many  of  which  have  experienced
              a sharp decrease in expected service  life  due  to  loading  induced by heavy
              truck traffic.   Some  of  these  bridges are approaching the end of their
              useful lives  and  will require extensive rebuilding or replacement unless 
              alternate, preferably less costly, ways are found to  reduce  stresses  and 
              strains that arise from traffic  loads.   The  project  examines several
              aspects of this problem, including  the  development of high resolution
              control-oriented  models  that account for important effects such as
              vehicle-structure  dynamic  interactions,  bridge and  roadway  condition,  and
               traffic  intensity, as well as identification and evaluation  of  candidate 
              intelligent response reduction  schemes  that  work   primarily   through 
              tuning  of  individual   vehicle  suspensions and bridge parameters.  The
              problem  embodies  a  number  of  components particularly related to  problems 
              of  scale  and  structure and to interplay between  computations  and  data.  
              Among  the former, the dynamic  interaction  of  potentially  many  vehicles
              with  the  bridge  under  highly  variable  traffic conditions, with concurrent
              adaptivity  of  individual  vehicle suspensions prior to entering  and  even 
              while  on the bridge, represents an extreme case of multiple  scales  in  both
              space and time.  The latter is, of  course,  highly   contingent  upon  remote 
              sensing,  communications,  adaptivity, and assessment, all in real time, and
              represents  a real challenge to the computation/data interface.  ***
