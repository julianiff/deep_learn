Abstract    :
              All human societies have systematic ways of reckoning kinship relations, and the
              study of these systems has been a specialty of cultural anthropology for over
              100 years.  This project applies simple but powerful models from graph theory
              to analyze cross-linguistic and historical linguistic marking relations and
              evolutionary sequences in a sample of systems of kinship classification, the
              Polynesian, Oceanic, Salishan, Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian families. The
              research will integrate the linguistic theory of Joseph Greenberg on kinship
              universals into the mainstream of kinship studies.  It will demonstrate the
              necessity of using historical linguistic data to determine the direction of
              change in kinship terminology.  The discovery of convergent developments in
              different linguistic families can then inform more abstract theories about
              trends in the evolution of kinship terminology in general. The data on the
              kinship systems to be analyzed will come from published sources.  The research
              will make significant contributions to kinship theory, cognitive and linguistic
              anthropology and cognitive science. It will add to scientific knowledge in
              cultural anthropology through the discovery and explanation of lawful
              regularities in kinship, the most fundamental of all human classification
              systems.
