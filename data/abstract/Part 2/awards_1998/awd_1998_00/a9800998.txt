              ABSTRACT    Alexander Goncharov  Brown University  98 00998      Professor
              Goncharov will continue his work on classical polylogarithms, and their
              generalizations, special values of L-functions of algebraic varieties,
              algebraic K-theory, and motivic Galois groups.  In particular the investigator
              will consider the Hodge theoretic analogs of polylogarithms, as well as
              classical and Grassmannian polylogarithms. He will study analogs of a
              conjecture of Zagier to help investigate the Galois group of the category of
              mixed motives generated by an elliptic curve.  Further Professor Goncharov will
              try to establish the basic properties of higher Arakelov Chow groups    This
              project involves mathematics on the borderlines of Algebra, Number Theory and
              Geometry in an area known as algebraic K-theory. K-theory represents a powerful
              method in the modern approach to many mathematical studies. Mathematicians have
              know for quite a long time that the key to understanding a mathematical
              construction is in understanding its symmetries. In some sense, K-theory
              formalizes the study of the  algebraic symmetries of mathematical objects.
              Polylogarithms have been around for centuries in one form or another, but only
              recently has their whole theory become available.  They have deep connections
              with both number theory and modern mathematical physics. This project should
              shed light on these connections.
