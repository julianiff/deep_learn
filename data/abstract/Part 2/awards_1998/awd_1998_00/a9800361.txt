Abstract    :
              The proposed research lies in the interface of several complex variables, number
              theory, and differential geometry, in particular, it involves the somewhat
              mysterious relationship between Nevanlinna theory and the theory of Diophantine
              geometry. The following topics will be investigated: moving target problems in
              Diophantine approximation and Nevanlinna theory, Diophantine approximation by
              algebraic points of bounded degree, and the Kobayashi conjecture in the theory
              of complex hyperbolic geometry.  A second part of the project will involve the
              study of the value distribution properties of the Gauss map of minimal surfaces
              and minimal submanifolds in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. 

Number
              theory and complex analysis, two old but important subjects, have been found to
              have important applications in Engineering, Biology, Computer Sciences, and
              other fields. Historically these two subjects developed independently. 
              Recently it was discovered that they are somewhat related; in particular,
              Nevanlinna theory in complex analysis and Diophantine approximation in number
              theory bear striking similarities and connections.  This interplay has lead to
              several important new results in number theory and in complex analysis.  It is
              hoped that the newly discovered relationship will revolutionize the researches
              and will lead major new advances in both subjects.  Such advances would have a
              great impact in the whole area of mathematics.
