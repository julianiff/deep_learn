Abstract    :
              This award was made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. The project
              investigates a possible link between cortisol and inhibitory or effortful
              control in young children. The PI (M. Gunnar) studies the role of cortisol in
              behavioral adaptation and its impact on the central nervous system and
              behavior. The co-PI (G. Kochanska) studies effortful control, self-regulation,
              affectivity, and temperament in young children. The two investigators will link
              their programs of research to study whether dysregulation of the daily rhythm
              in cortisol, and/or elevated cortisol responses to stressors might be related
              to poor inhibitory control in preschool children. Repeated assessments of
              cortisol levels (derived from samples of saliva) will be related to childrens'
              inhibitory/effortful control, also measured repeatedly over time. Preliminary
              data indicate that children who score consistently low on inhibitory control
              competencies over the preschool years show a marked suppression of the first
              morning cortisol values compared to other children. As a result, the daily
              rhythm in cortisol production is dampened in these children. It is not known
              whether the childrens' poor inhibitory control abilities preceded or followed
              the alteration in their daily cortisol rhythm. This project is designed to gain
              further insight into this relationship between glucocorticoids and attention
              regulation and inhibitory control.
