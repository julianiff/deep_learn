Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9800030    Principal Investigator: Keith Wanser    Title:
              Novel fiber optic sensors and devices employing curved fibers and fiber Bragg
              gratings    Abstract    The proposed research is to investigate experimentally
              and theoretically novel fiber sensor and device configurations utilizing
              curvature effects in optical fibers and optical fiber Bragg gratings.  The
              investigation involves interferometric measurement of the bending induced phase
              shift and amplitude transmittance of the single mode fiber shaped in Elastica
              configuration, measurement of the optical-longitudinal strain relationship in a
              chirped Bragg grating to verify the theoretical prediction of 3 orders of
              magnitude enhancement of the strain effect over the ordinary optical fiber, and
              the amplitude and phase effect associated with highly curved Bragg gratings.
