Abstract    :
              The "Working with Biotechnology" is a Demonstration Project that  strengthens
              and deepens the highly successful activities of  "Biotechnology Works!", a
              summer institute in immunology and  genetics for students with disabilities and
              their high school  teachers.  The projected outcomes of the Working with 
              Biotechnology project are to effect long-term changes in the: 1)  participation
              of persons with disabilities in the sciences; 2)  methods, materials, and
              curricula used in high school science  classes, particularly in chemistry and
              biology; 3) practices and  preparation of high school science teachers; and 4)
              practices and  preparation of high school guidance counselors.  The intended 
              impact of this project will be that persons with disabilities  will enter
              science careers and that new discoveries will be made  in science that will
              benefit humankind.  This project should have  a long term impact on the number
              of students with disabilities  who take advanced science courses in high
              schools and in higher  education, the number of students with disabilities who
              pursue  careers in science, the practices and preparation of high school 
              science teachers, the practices and preparation of high school  guidance
              counselors, and high school science curricula and  instruction.    Over a
              three-year period, this project will work intensively and  comprehensively with
              high school students with disabilities,  their science teachers, and high
              school guidance counselors in  Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to pilot,
              develop, refine, and  disseminate curriculum materials, science laboratory
              materials,  and career development information.  The following activities 
              (inputs or objectives) will be conducted:       extend curriculum adaptations
              for students with disabilities        in immunology and genetics that were
              developed during               Biotechnology Works!     refine curriculum
              adaptations for students with disabilities        in immunology and genetics
              that were developed during               Biotechn ology Works!     field test
              curriculum and adaptations through two summer            institutes in 1998 and
              1999 in immunology and genetics for          high school students and high
              school science teachers      mentoring of high school science students    
              mentoring of high school science teachers      develop curriculum materials and
              information for high school        science teachers      prepare career
              development materials and information for high       school guidance counselors
              on promoting and encouraging the         participation of students with
              disabilities in science careers      intensive dissemination of materials and
              information through        the World Wide Web, workshops, listserves, press
              releases,          national conferences, journal articles, and the ERIC        
              Clearinghouse.
