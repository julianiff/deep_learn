Abstract    :
              9800643 Fernando This is an award to provide support for research on minimizing
              the environmental impact of a process for decontamination of soil that had been
              contaminated by use of mercury in extracting gold and silver from ores mined in
              the United States and Mexico.  The work involves collaboration with Dr. Tetsuya
              Ogura of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara in Mexico on soils obtained
              from contaminated sites in Zacatecas, Mexico.  The process currently in use
              there involves treatment of soil contaminated by these metals with an aqueous
              solution of calcium thiosulfate produced by passing sulfur dioxide through an
              aqueous suspension of lime and elemental sulfur.  The resultant solution of
              metal contaminants is contacted with metals that precipitate elemental mercury
              containing amalgamated gold and silver which can be extracted from the amalgam
              by heating it to vaporize the mercury.  Process control is important to avoid
              its potential pollutional impact on air, water and soil. 

Results of this
              project are expected to provide knowledge as to how the process being studied
              can be designed and conducted to obtain its benefits and minimize its potential
              negative environmental impact.  Research will also identify the advantages and
              disadvantages of the process over currently available alternative technologies
              for removing mercury from soil.  This project is being partially supported
              through a program of collaboration with the Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia
              (CONACyT) of Mexico.
