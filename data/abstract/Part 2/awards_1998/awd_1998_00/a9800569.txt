Abstract    :
              In this study, a new, innovative and highly efficient neuro-mechanistic-based
              (NMB) constitutive models applicable to sandy soils will be developed.  This
              will be accomplished by taking full advantage of the best features of both
              mechanistic and computational neuronet approaches to create new, innovative and
              robust constitutive model methodology.  The research will capitalize on the
              powerful function approximation capability of computational neuronets and will
              utilize, at the same time, the best and most accurate information of
              mechanistic-based knowledge.    To this end, a hybrid approach will be utilized
              to construct parameters- and assumptions-free constitutive models from
              available experimental stress-strain data.  Additionally, these
              neuro-mechanistic models will generally be able to:  I) construct, rapidly and
              efficiently, the desired one, two or three-dimensional constitutive models that
              can meet the needs of the dimension-types analysis from a given set of
              experimental date, and ii) model accurately the highly complex and strongly
              path-dependent stress-strain behavior of sand under various loading conditions
              by incorporating the dynamic-sequential updating scheme within the framework of
              the NMB constitutive modeling approach to be developed.  Consequently, the
              applicability of the neuro-mechanistic-based constitutive models will be
              expanded incrementally to account for varying soil properties/parameters and/or
              in situ values.
