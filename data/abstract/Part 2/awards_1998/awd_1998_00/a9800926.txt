Abstract    :
              ***  9800926  Pykett    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will extend the development of Cellfoam hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) culture
              systems for long-term maintenance aimed at advancing bone marrow
              transplantation and HSC gene therapy procedures.  Phase I  research
              demonstrated the ability of Cellfoam to maintain and expand primitive,
              multipotent HSCs for extended periods in an environment in which no
              supplemented cytokines are required.  Building on the proof of principle
              established in Phase I research, Phase II will develop advanced Cellfoam
              applications by addressing the following specific aims: Pre-clinical
              optimization of large scale Cellfoam-HSC culture systems; Evaluation of the in
              vivo engraftment capabilities of HSCs cultured in large scale Cellfoam systems
              using a SCID mouse animal model; Examination of transduction rates and in vivo
              engraftment capabilities of HSCs transduced in large scale Cellfoam systems. 
              This work will demonstrate the ability of Cellfoam to promote, on a clinically
              relevant scale, the extended survival, expansion and transduction of
              multipotent HSCs in a cytokine-free system for enhanced bone marrow
              transplantation and gene therapy, goals which are currently not possible with
              existing technologies and which would markedly enhance the ability to treat
              individuals with various hematopoietic disorders.  Commercial applications are
              aimed at clinical markets for bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy of
              hematopoietic disorders.  The annual US market for bone marrow transplantation
              stands at $4.5 billion; markets for HSC gene therapy are just emerging.  ***
