Abstract    :
              Ellen Zweibel  University of Colorado  FY 98:  $225,000  For 36 months.   
              Structure and Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds.    Dr. Zweibel
              will conduct a program of theoretical research on magnetic fields in
              interstellar clouds.  She and her colleagues will concentrate on reevaluating
              the theoretical evidence for weak magnetic fields and for examining several
              processes which could lead to loss of magnetic flux from molecular clouds.  The
              research methods involve analytical techniques coupled to state of the art
              numerical computations, and comparison, where possible, with observations.
