Abstract    :
              9800172  Boersma  This award provides funds to support the travel of 15 graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the Society for Conservation
              Biology annual meetings in Sydney Australia. Travel funds will be awarded based
              on need, quality and significance of research to conservation biology, and
              other selection criteria. Participating in the annual meeting is considered to
              be an important aspect of academic training. This award will facilitate the
              interaction of 15 young scientists from the US with an international community
              of conservation biologists.
