Abstract    :
                   This project will study stochastically modelled  physical systems in which
              escape from a metastable state is  induced by weak random perturbations, or
              noise.  The  stochastic models will, in general, lack the property of  detailed
              balance.  Such models arise naturally in many  physical contexts, including the
              study of glasses and the  study of rate processes in chemical physics, where
              the  random perturbations are due to thermal fluctuations.  Problems to be
              investigated include widespread but little-  analysed phenomena such as escape
              from a stable or over an  unstable limit cycle, escape over an unstable fixed
              point,  and critical behavior due to an incipient bifurcation of the  most
              probable noise-induced escape path.  The mathematical  challenges presented by
              these sorts of problem have impeded  progress, so that understanding trails far
              behind the  systematic understanding of the older (Kramers) problem of 
              stochastic escape, in stochastic models exhibiting detailed  balance.  To study
              models without detailed balance, both  numerical and analytical techniques will
              be applied.  The  latter include matched asymptotic expansions and Hamilton- 
              Jacobi theory.
