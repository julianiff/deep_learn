Abstract    :
              9800867  Kuchar    This U.S.-Mexico award will support collaborative research 
              between Prof. Karel Kuchar of the University of Utah and  Prof. Jemal Guven and
              Prof. Michael Ryan of the Instituto de  Ciencias Nucleares of the Universidad
              Nacional Autonoma de  Mexico (UNAM).  The researchers intend to examine what 
              canonical quantum gravity can reveal about gravitational  collapse.  The goal
              is to go beyond semiclassical  approximations and gain some insights about the
              effects  induced by quantum geometry in one of the most puzzling  processes
              predicted by general relativity and quantum  theory: the formation of a black
              hole by gravitational  collapse and its evaporation by Hawking radiation.   
              Prof. Kuchar's research at the University of Utah involves  both
              astrophysical/computational work and research related  to the mathematical
              foundations of relativity and  quantization.  The Mexican group is large and 
              multidisciplinary, covering quantum gravity, relativistic  astrophysics,
              classical cosmology, variational principles,  black hole physics, and geometric
              approaches to various  branches of physics.  The complementary expertise of the
               researchers forms the basis for the intended collaboration.  ***
