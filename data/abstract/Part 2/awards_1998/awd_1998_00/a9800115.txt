The vacuum Einstein equations for gravitation shall
              be studied without imposing any symmetry or restriction on the size of the
              initial data.  The structure of spacetime singularities resulting from a
              trapped region shall be explored.  Initial conditions which leads in evolution
              to the formation of trapped regions shall be sought.  The possibility of
              singularity formation not resulting from a trapped region shall be
              investigated.  Criteria for the local extendibility of solutions shall be
              sought to which improve known results.  Also, an effort shall be made to
              establish a variational characterization of the Kerr solution.  The work on the
              spherically symmetric Einstein equations with matter represented by the
              two-phase fluid model shall be continued with the aim of characterizing the
              initial conditions leading to the two alternatives: black hole or neutron star
              formation.  Finally, the two-phase model without the restriction to spherical
              symmetry shall be studied in the framework of special relativity.

These
              mathematical studies will provide insight into difficult fundamental questions
              in gravitation theory.
