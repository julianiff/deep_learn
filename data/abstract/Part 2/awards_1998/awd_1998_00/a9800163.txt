Abstract    :
              Hendershott    9800163    A study of the physical and biological response of the
               coastal region off  Baja  California, Mexico during the 1997 El Nino event
              will be  initiated.  The proposed  measurements would supplement a Mexican
              research program  called  IMECOCAL that is scheduled to occupy a set of
              transects of  the original  California Cooperative Fisheries (CALCOFI) grid
              starting in  January 1998.  An  initial cruise would take place in November and
              the number  of stations and lines  occupied during the January cruise would be
              increased. In  addition to these  standard hydrographic surveys, a pair of
              pressure gauges  will be deployed at  Guadaloupe Island (29 N) and at a coastal
              location at Punta  Baja (30 N) to  monitor the sea surface pressure gradient
              normal to the  coast, and hence the  mean flow of the California Current
              throughout the current  El Nino and  afterwards.
