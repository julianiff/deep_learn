The spatially homogeneous, isotropic Standard Cosmological
              Model appears to describe our Universe reasonably well.  However, Einstein's
              equations allow a much larger class of cosmological solutions.  Theorems
              originally due to Penrose and Hawking predict that all such models (assuming
              reasonable matter properties) will have an initial singularity.  The nature of
              this singularity in generic cosmologies remains a major open question in
              general relativity.  Spatially homogeneous but possibly anisotropic cosmologies
              have two types of singularities:  (1) velocity dominated--(reversing the time
              direction) the universe evolves to the singularity with fixed anisotropic
              collapse rates; (2) Mixmaster--the anisotropic collapse rates change in a
              deterministically chaotic way.  Much less is known about spatially
              inhomogeneous universes.

Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (BKL) claimed
              long ago that a generic universe would evolve toward the singularity as a
              different Mixmaster universe at each spatial point.  This long-term research
              program will test the BKL conjecture numerically.
