Abstract    :
                    Two-dimensional stratigraphic models are limited since they  assume that
              all sediment is transported across the margin  and fail to capture the inherent
              3D variability of most  geological systems.  2-D models therefore cannot
              simulate  alongshore transport of sediments and formation of an onlap  surface
              that defines the lowstand systems tract.  Across and  along margin transport
              and deposition is also controlled by  advection and diffusion processes.  Funds
              are provided for a  small grant for exploratory research so that the Is can 
              verify the viability of the Australian biostratigraphy as a  high resolution
              correlation tool in the Barrow Delta system  and to attempt to model a
              clinoform  package within the  Barrow with model predictions based on seismic
              reflection  and litho- and biostratigraphic data.
