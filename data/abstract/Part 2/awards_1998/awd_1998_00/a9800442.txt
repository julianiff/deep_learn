Abstract    :
              Ian B.Thompson  George W. Preston  Stephen A. Shectman  Carnegie Observatories 
              FY 98: $123,697  For 36 months.    A Search for Supermetal-poor Stars.    Drs.
              Thompson, Preston, and Shectman at the Carnegie Observatories will carry out a
              photometric search for supermetal-poor stars in an area of the inner halo of
              our Galaxy.  The survey will be conducted at the Las Campanas Observatory 2.5-m
              telescope.  Supermetal-poor stars, likely produced from debris of first
              generation supernovae, provide the foundation for subsequent investigations by
              high resolution spectroscopy at the new large telescope that are being
              constructed in the southern hemisphere.  Abundance analysis of a large sample
              of such stars is crucial for further exploration of the range and variety of
              metal yields evidently produced by supernovae in early Galactic times.
