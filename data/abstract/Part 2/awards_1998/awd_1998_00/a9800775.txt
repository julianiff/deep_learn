Abstract    :
              9800885  Strauss  Plant traits that affect herbivory are usually studies without
              considering effects on pollination, or vice versa. This may result in an
              incomplete understanding of selection on these traits. Two species of
              Castilleja hemiparasites, which can obtain alkaloids from Lupinus host plants,
              will be used to test whether chemical defense against herbivores also deters
              pollinators. Castilleja species will be grown with either low-alkaloid or
              high-alkaloid varieties of conspecific lupines to test the consequences of
              alkaloid uptake on herbivory and pollination. Preliminary data support the
              hypothesis that these is an ecological tradeoff between herbivore defense and
              pollinator attraction. If such a tradeoff exists, it suggests new possibilities
              for constraints on the development of chemical defenses. The proposed research
              integrates chemical ecology at the whole plant level, advances basic knowledge
              of the ecology of parasitic plants, and develops a new methods to assess
              consequences of novel defensive chemicals in vivo. The concept that
              plant-animal interactions may be constrained by multiple selection pressures
              has broad applications in both natural and agricultural systems.
