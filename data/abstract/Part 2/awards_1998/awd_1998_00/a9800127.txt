Abstract    :
              Abstract  9800127  S. Majetich, Carnegie Mellon University    The objective is
              to prepare magnetic nanoparticle arrays in nonmagnetic matrices, and measure
              the interaction magnetic effects for various nanoparticle shapes from spheres
              to rods.  A self-assembly method will be used to create monodispersed
              nano-sized nonmagnetic arrays that are transformed to a magnetic phase after
              solidifying the surrounding liquid.  A second approach will consist in coating
              the particles in order to control interparticle spacing.  Iron oxides are
              selected as the prototype material.  Various characterization methods will be
              used to measure magnetic coercivity, magnetization directions of individual
              particles, interparticle coupling with the Faucault Lorentz microscopy, and
              nanoparticle moments by magnetic force microscopy.  Simple particle interaction
              models will be developed to interpret the experimental results.  The proposed
              particle synthesis methods and the investigation of the interparticle forces
              will provide fundamental information for development of magnetic data storage
              equipment.   ***
