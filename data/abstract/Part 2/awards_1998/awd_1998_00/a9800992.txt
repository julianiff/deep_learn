Abstract    :
              Interconnect is rapidly becoming one of the most important  factors in
              influencing the behavior of integrated circuits.  This project addresses the
              problem of developing next-  generation computer-aided design tools to handle
              these  problems. The objective of this work is to apply recent  advances in
              fast simulation of interconnect to solve  optimization problems in interconnect
              design. Specifically,  problems related to the design of supply busses, clock 
              networks and signal nets are being investigated.  In case of  supply nets,
              structured mesh topologies that provide a good  tradeoff between performance
              and ease of analysis are being  considered.  In case of signal nets, the
              problem of building  optimal rectilinear Seiner trees under an environment of 
              resistive, capacitive and inductive effects are being  studied, with
              consideration to the interactions with  detailed routing.  In addition to
              delay, the work  incorporates considerations of signal integrity and 
              manufacturability during the optimization.
