Abstract    :
              DMI-9800323  Feeny   Material removal during milling may be steady or
              oscillatory, depending on materials, geometry, and parameters such as depth of
              cut and cutting speed. The dynamics of material removal affects the quality of
              the finished surface. This is reflected in the form of chips which may be
              smooth or segmented.  The objective of this GOALI project is to derive models
              that describe these behaviors and their dependencies on parameters, and verify
              the models with experiments. Basic assumptions in an existing two-dimensional
              model for material removal, which accounts for the onset of chip segmentation,
              will be relaxed to allow the modeling of more phenomena and parameter
              dependencies which are observed experimentally. To verify the upgraded model,
              experiments are to be conducted with orthogonal and conventional cutting
              geometry on a high-speed milling machine at the Manufacturing Engineering
              Laboratory at NIST. Cutting will be monitored using a rotating spindle-mounted
              dynamometer with radio-frequency telemetry, high-bandwidth infrared temperature
              sensors and possibly ultrasonic emission sensors.  The development of
              predictive models of cutting mechanics and dynamics complements finite-element
              analyses and experiments.  These models will provide understanding and broad
              intuition on the effect of machining parameters on cutting process behavior.
              The work is practically valuable to the manufacture of automotive and aircraft
              parts.
