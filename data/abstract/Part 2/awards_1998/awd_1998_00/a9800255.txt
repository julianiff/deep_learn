Abstract    :
              9800255  Craig  Composite caps consisting of a geomembrane and compacted  clay
              layer are often used for closure of landfills and for  isolation of
              contaminated soil and waste because they are  very effective at minimizing
              percolation.  However,  composite caps are expensive.  As a result, interest
              has  developed in less costly and equally effective alternative  caps
              constructed almost entirely with earthen materials.  The objective of the
              proposed study is to investigate  fundamental factors affecting the behavior of
              a new  alternative earthen cap called a "dry barrier," a special  type of
              earthen cover where airflow is used to remove  intruding water.  This design
              permits the use of thinner  layers while still preventing percolation, even
              during the  most stressful periods, such as snowmelt and heavy winter 
              rainfalls.  As a result, thinner layers are required and the  cost of the cap
              is lower.    Designing dry barriers requires an understanding of the "in  situ
              evaporation" process and flow of air laden with water  vapor in porous media. 
              Moreover, models need to be  developed for use in design.  This study addresses
              these  issues through experimental work and development of computer  models.  
              Experiments will be conducted to characterize the  "in situ evaporation
              process" as a function of soil type,  water content, air stream velocity, and
              humidity of the air  stream.  Models will be developed based on the
              experimental  work and verified using large-scale laboratory tests and a  field
              experiment.  Results of this study will demonstrate  the benefits of using dry
              barriers and provide analytical  tools and data for their design.  ***
