Abstract    :
              This is the first 18 months of a three-year continuation award.  Paper is a
              well-evolved media for expressing and recording information.  It is inexpensive
              and ubiquitous.  It is highly portable, provides a very high degree of
              readability, and its use is already highly familiar to most people.  However,
              paper is primarily a static and non-interactive media.  It does not offer the
              many benefits of electronic media such as indexing, searching, customization,
              hyperlinking, and dynamic content.  The goal of this project is to develop and
              evaluate new techniques that allow various forms of electronic capabilities to
              be added to or used in conjunction with, paper materials.  To this end, new
              devices will be constructed which enable paper in several ways.  In addition,
              new interaction tchniqu4es will be developed which exploit these new device
              capabilities.  Finally, applications will be built and tested with users to
              validate the benefits of this new technology.  The end product of this project
              will be technology and techniques which allow paper materials to conveniently
              participate as computational objects.  By bringing computer capabilities to
              everyday objects, we hope to increase the extent to which computers can be used
              on human terms, with machines adapting to the work style of the person rather
              that the person adapting to the machine.
