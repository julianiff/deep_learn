Abstract    :
              9800537  Slaughter  This research will develop design approaches for facilities 
              which explicitly acknowledge and take into account changing  requirements over
              the long term (e.g., 100 years).  Specifically, the research will characterize
              interactions  within and among systems that influence the capacity of  built
              facilities to change over the long-term, which can be  called "facility
              flexibility."  Using the framework of  interactions among systems, and defined
              types of changes,  the research will explore the impacts of new design or 
              technology innovations on the facility flexibility.  Innovations may be in
              systems and their components or in  construction processes, and can potentially
              decrease costs  and time associated with effectively responding to changes.   
              The research will be empirically based, using data from  actual facilities and
              projects, and will use advanced  computer analysis and simulation tools to
              organize the  interaction framework and evaluate scenarios.  The data on 
              buildings will be collected from the owners, facilities  managers, architects,
              engineers, and contractors as  applicable.  The data will be used to construct
              and inform  the building systems and interactions framework.  This  framework
              will then be used to identify the nature of the  system's capacity to respond
              to changes, specifically in  function, capacity, and flow, over the long term. 
              These scenario-testing models will provide a means through  which to estimate
              the relative costs/benefits, time,  performance, and worker safety associated
              with accommodating  the changes.  The scenario models can then be used to 
              estimate the degree and nature of the impacts of design and  technology
              innovations.    The results from this research will be a systematic 
              methodology and a set of tools (the building system and  interaction framework
              and scenario models) to assess the  capacity of a built facility to respond to
              changes over the  long term.  ****
