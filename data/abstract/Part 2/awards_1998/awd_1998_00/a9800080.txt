Abstract    :
              Many of the nation's highway bridges are aging and are showing signs of
              deterioration due to environmental effects.  Innovative and durable materials
              are needed for future bridge construction and major bridge rehabilitation. 
              Fiber-reinforced plastics are known to have high resistance against
              environmental effects.  An interdisciplinary approach is needed to investigate
              the potential application of FRP's in bridge engineering.  This study addresses
              the basic behavior of innovative beams made with graphite/epoxy (G/E)
              composites used in combination with high-strength reinforced concrete slabs. 
              The study will integrate two disciplines, bridge engineering and composite
              materials, to establish the feasibility of using CG/E (concrete and G/E)
              sections in bridge construction.  The new shapes are aimed at developing a
              reliable connection at the interface of the concrete slab and the G/E sections.
               One aspect of the research will determine if adhesives can be eliminated
              altogether at the concrete G/E interface.  Another aspect of the study will
              examine the fatigue response of the proposed sections to assess their
              suitability for application in bridges.
