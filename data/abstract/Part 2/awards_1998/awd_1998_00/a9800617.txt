Abstract    :
              9800617  Yarmush  This SGER proposal deals with increasing the effectiveness 
              often transfer to mammalian cells using recombinant  retroviruses.  In previous
              efforts, the PIs have found that  glycoproteins produced by virus producer
              cells inhibit  retroviral-mediated gene transfer.  Enzymes that degrade  these
              proteoglycans enhance the productivity of the gene  transfer to mammalian
              cells.  Since the size of the  proteoglycans and the viral particles are
              similar, physicals  separations seem unlikely.    The overall goal of this
              proposal is to better understand  the role of the proteoglycans in the
              inhibition process.  This will be accomplished by:            Isolating and
              purifying the proteoglycans and studying         their impact, and the impact
              of their protein and glycan         fragments on the transfer process          
               Measuring the binding of these inhibitors to both the         target cells and
              the retrovirus.  Identify the inhibitor         fragment and the cell receptor
              responsible for the         inhibition.            Develop a model of the
              inhibition process    A better understanding of the inhibition mechanism and
              its  scope should facilitate discovery of routes to remedy the  problem.  One
              such route already considered involves  incorporation of genes for proteoglycan
              destruction.  ***
