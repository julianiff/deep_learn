Abstract    :
              9800483  Chen  The successful integration of lightweight composite structures
              into high volume applications is impeded by the lack of cost-effective, high
              quality manufacturing processes for these materials.  This research will
              investigate the processing of co-mingled, non-crimp fabrics in a thermoplastic
              composite matrix.    The goal of this research is to utilize a combination of
              experimentation, analytical modeling, and numerical simulation of the stamping
              process to optimize the material structure and the process parameters. In
              addition to regular interactions between the University and the industrial
              collaborator's (Ford Motor Company) researchers, access to the stamping
              equipment at Ford will lead to a more accurate understanding of the material
              behavior at the production scale, and quick turnaround of the results to the
              industrial process.   It is anticipated that simulation of the manufacturing
              process can be used in conjunction with material characterization tests to
              reduce development cycle time, lower tooling costs, guide materials selection,
              and improve product and process reliability.
