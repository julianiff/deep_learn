Abstract    :
              DMI-9800237  German  The funds provided by the National Science Foundation in
              this program will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art rheological testing
              system for the study of polymer-powder mixtures, consisting of a torque
              rheometer with a twin-screw extrusion attachment.  This equipment will be used
              in the development of materials in areas such as powder injection molding,
              solder paste formulation, direct metal injection molding, and pressureless and
              centrifugal forming. It is crucial to understand the interaction of metal or
              ceramic powder with a viscous fluid in all of these applications,.   This
              equipment will allow the fundamental study of feedstock rheology and
              quantification of viscosity, yield strength, phase separation, mixing kinetics,
              the characterization of shear thinning and shear thickening, and many other
              phenomenon.  The twin screw attachment permits the collection of fundamental
              data relevant to the continuous mixing of polymer/powder systems, an area which
              is poorly understood.   This is a multi-user piece of equipment, which
              complements existing capabilities in polymer research. The equipment will be
              highly utilized by the many undergraduate and graduate students in the P/M Lab
              who are conducting research in particulate materials as part of their
              educational programs.  It will be used for in-lab demonstrations and the many
              active research programs currently being studied in the lab, thereby
              significantly advancing the current knowledge of the rheological behavior of
              powder-loaded systems.
