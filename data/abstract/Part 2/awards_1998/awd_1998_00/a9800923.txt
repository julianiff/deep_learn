Abstract    :
              ***  9800923  Carter             This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase II project will develop a miniaturized Total Organic Carbon (TOC)
              analysis system for on-site monitoring applications.  The analytical technique
              employs a microfluidic sensor for reliable and rapid measurement of TOC trace
              quantities in aqueous effluent.  Detection relies on photocatalytic
              mineralization of dissolved and suspended organics to carbon dioxide.  Rapid
              equilibrium of carbon dioxide with carbonate species permits quantification of
              TOC using a conductivity measurement.  Phase I experiments showed advantages
              over commercially available analytical instruments.  Response time of the
              miniaturized TOC analysis system was four times faster than commercial
              instruments; only 30 seconds per measurement was required versus 120 seconds
              for conventional instruments.  Phase II enhancements are expected to provide
              TOC measurements in 2 seconds.    Performance enhancements of this magnitude
              would be a quantum improvement in real-time TOC instrumentation.  Rapid,
              reliable, and reproducible measurements of organic contaminants in aqueous
              effluent are expected to find commercial applications in the semiconductor,
              pharmaceutical, drinking water, power generation, and waste water industries.
