This project supports graduate student and junior researcher
              participation in the Fifth International Conference on Integral Methods in
              Science and Engineering (IMSE98) which will be held August 10-13, 1998 at
              Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan.  

The invited
              speakers:

Gregory Beylkin (University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado),
              Archie G. Gibson (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico), Glenn R.
              Ierley (Scripps Institute, San Diego, California), Sangtae Kim (University of
              Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin), M. Zuhair Nashed (University of Delaware,
              Newark, Delaware), Jean Claude Nedelec (Centre de Mathematiques Appliquees,
              Palaiseau, France), Brian Sleeman (University of Leeds, Leeds, United
              Kingdom),

Will discuss numerous rapidly evolving areas of Integral
              Methodology.  Since such techniques embrace a wide variety of scientific
              disciplines, conference participants will have many opportunities to broaden
              established research programs, as well as  obtain an introduction to a wide
              range of fields employing  integral methodologies.  Since this is truly an
              interdisciplinary meeting,  there will be many opportunities for technology
              transfer of state of the art integral methods to and between the different
              applied sciences and engineering.   In addition, this conference will provide
              the opportunity for young scientists to meet, listen to, converse with, and
              learn from more seasoned researchers.
