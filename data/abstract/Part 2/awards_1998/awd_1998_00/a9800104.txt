Classical trajectories are those that minimize an
              action.  Quantization involves considering all possible paths, even those that
              do not minimize the action, and summing over them with weights determined by
              the action.  Einstein's theory of gravity can be described in terms of an
              action which is minimized by the classical solution for the spacetime metric. 
              If gravitation is quantized in a manner analogous to all other fields, then it
              is necessary to consider all possible metrics and to sum over them with
              appropriate weights.  Defining the set of all possible metrics and performing
              this sum are the basic issues addressed here.

Professor Renken will try to
              construct a quantum theory of gravitation by constructing a computer-based
              version of the theory.  This work is of fundamental importance to physics, and
              addresses the major outstanding problem in theoretical physics research.
