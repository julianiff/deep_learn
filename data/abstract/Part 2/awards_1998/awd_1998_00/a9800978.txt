This project continues the ongoing program to develop the
              fundamental theory of nuclear and other many-particle systems, with application
              to astrophysical and condensed matter systems.
	Nuclear studies emphasize the
              structure of hadrons, nuclei and nuclear matter; use of high energy electrons
              to map these structures with subfemtometer resolution; and the developing area
              of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions where the quark-gluon plasma, a
              state of matter that occurred early in the universe, may be recreated in
              laboratory.  Special focus is on development of new computational techniques
              for exact calculations of the structure and reactions of light
              nuclei.
	Projects in astrophysics include study of the composition and phases
              of the various types of matter in neutron stars; dynamics of superfluid
              vortices in neutron stars, with applications to pulsar speedups; effects of
              phase transitions on neutron star evolution; the electrical conductivity and
              generation of magnetic fields in the early universe.
	Research on relativistic
              many-body problems focuses on the theory of electromagnetic and quark-gluon
              plasmas, and on studies of nuclei with relativistic Hamiltonians.  The
              condensed matter physics program aims at theories of quantum liquids, dynamical
              response, quantized vortex systems, Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons and
              trapped atoms, and atomic clusters.
