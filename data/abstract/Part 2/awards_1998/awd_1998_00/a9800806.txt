Abstract    :
              DMI-9800806  Wiens  The objectives of this GOALI project are to identify and
              characterize the dynamic performance of hexapod machine tools by establishing a
              method for modeling and system parameter identification.   The method
              incorporates a coordinated three-pronged approach of experiments, analysis, and
              reconciliation/validation.  Finite element modeling will be used to guide the
              experimentation and validate the structural dynamic model.  Both finite element
              modeling and rigid body/lumped parameter modeling facilitate the identification
              of critical system parameters, platform configurations, slewing trajectories,
              sensor locations, and type of excitation.  Component mode synthesis techniques
              will be used to combine the structural dynamics and rigid body/lumped parameter
              models into an overall model of the hexapod machine tool dynamics. 
              Augmentation and reconciliation of the hexapod machine tool models will be
              performed using parameter estimation techniques.  The research work plan
              involves theoretical modeling and simulation, and a series of experiments
              conducted at Sandia National Laboratories followed by full implementation of
              the method on both of hexapod machine tools at Sandia. Input from the project's
              industrial advisory committee will facilitate testing, standardization, and
              benchmarking.  The research will provide a systematic method for generating a
              validated dynamic model of hexapod machine tools. This forms a basis for
              possible widespread adoption of hexapod machine tools as a new machining
              paradigm in industry.
