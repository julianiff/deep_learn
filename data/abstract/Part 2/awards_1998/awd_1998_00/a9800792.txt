              Proposal Number: ECS-9800792    Principal Investigator: Shin-Shem Pei    Title:
              Interband cascade laser for remote chemical sensing applications    Abstract   
                  The proposed research is to develop a new type of mid-IR lasers in the 3-5
              micron wavelength region.  The laser is based on the type-II interband quantum
              well laser design that has shown superior performance than other mid-IR lasers
              in lower threshold current and higher operating temperatures due to the reduced
              phonon-induced recombination and Auger recombination.
