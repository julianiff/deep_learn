Deborah A. Konkowski will continue her study of
              spacetimes with mild singularities and Cauchy horizons.  Mild singularities
              include quasiregular and nonscalar curvature singularities.  In the case of
              quasiregular singularities, particle paths end suddenly with no warning from
              infinitely-increasing tidal forces, while in the case of nonscalar curvature
              singularities some, but not all, particles moving near the singularity feel
              infinite tidal forces.  A Cauchy horizon is the boundary of the causal
              development of spacetime.  Cauchy horizons and singularities are intimately
              connect, including through the cosmic censorship conjecture, which continues to
              be debated.

This RUI research not only advances knowledge of the global
              structure of spacetime, it keeps the principal investigator, Prof. Konkowski,
              up-to-date in her field and improves her undergraduate teaching as a result. 
              The algebraic computing skills she gained in past NSF research has been
              directly applicable to her teaching activities.  The midshipmen who do work
              with her hone their mathematical skills and physical reasoning for graduate
              school.
