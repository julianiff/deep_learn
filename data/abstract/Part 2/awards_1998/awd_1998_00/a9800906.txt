Abstract    :
              ***  9800906  Twardoch  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              has as its goal to develop a process for electrodeposition of iridium oxide to
              produce conformal coatings on medical electrodes.  Iridium oxide is exceptional
              for functional electrical stimulation (FES) electrodes because of its corrosion
              resistance, low impedance, and high charge injection capacity.  Current methods
              of fabricating these coatings are unacceptable for many of the complex and
              thermally sensitive devices such as cochlear implants and neural cuffs.  With
              electrodeposition, manufactured electrodes for a variety of FES applications
              can be "retrofitted" with the coatings, or the coating procedure can be
              integrated into the production process.  The Phase I program was extremely
              successful.  A near-neutral, room temperature aqueous plating bath has been
              developed for coating any metal surface with adherent, electroactive iridium
              oxide.  Phase II will develop the control of electrodeposition to produce
              electrode coatings with maximum charge acceptance under pulse stimulation
              conditions on a variety of FES substrates.  Collaborations with FES vendors and
              researchers in diverse areas, including cochlear, bladder and intracortical
              prostheses are planned.  Phase III will entail coating services and licensing
              to the FES community.  Product targets: 1) Commercial medical electrodes for
              neural prosthesis for treatment of functional impairment such as hearing loss,
              incontinence, sexual dysfunction, limb paralysis, and spasficity; and for
              depolarization and corrosion protection in pacemakers 2) Equipment for coating
              electrodes.  ***
