Abstract: The
              goal of the project is to advance knowledge in some well-known areas of complex
              analysis, including the problems of conformal welding, diffusion limited
              aggregation, and the ergodic theory of harmonic measure on Julia sets.
              

Conformal mappings and harmonic measure are major and classical tools in
              the study of two-dimensional objects. They have been used in science and
              engineering for many years. Recently, there has been considerable interest in
              the extension of the classical theory to some classes of sets which have
              complicated ("fractal", "chaotic") structure and typically arise in dynamical
              systems or as random objects. Some of the most interesting examples include
              so-called "Laplacian clusters," certain random aggregates whose rate of growth
              depends on harmonic measure. Laplacian clusters serve as mathematical models
              for a large number of natural phenomena such as the process of diffusion
              limited aggregation, which has surfaced recently as a model for the formation
              of crystals, viscous fingering, and dielectric breakdown. Laplacian clusters
              have been extensively studied in the physical literature. The project will
              explore this topic, along with some other basic open problems concerning the
              general theory of conformal mappings and harmonic measure, as well as
              applications to dynamical and random fractals.
