Abstract    :
              PI: HAYES  9800886    The PIs study examines the evolution of rapid
              metamorphosis and its  hormonal control in desert-adapted amphibians. New World
              spadefoot toads  live in American deserts and breed in ephemeral pools where
              their extremely  rapid metamorphosis in less than two weeks is important to
              avoid  desiccation. The closest relatives to the New World spadefoot toads are
              the  Old World spadefoot toads and parsley frogs of Europe, Asia, and North 
              Africa, and are not known to have rapid metamorphosis. The PIs will  determine
              the evolutionary origin of rapid metamorphosis in spadefoot toads  and
              elucidate the hormonal mechanism that allowed for its evolution. This  research
              is the first to examine the physiology of a key-adaptation for  amphibian
              desert survival -- rapid metamorphosis. The PIs are integrating  natural
              history, phylogenetic analysis, and experimental physiology into an 
              evolutionary perspective.
