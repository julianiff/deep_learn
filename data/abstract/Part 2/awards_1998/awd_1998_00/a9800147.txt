Abstract    :
              9800147  Holloway    This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              constructing  a   laboratory-scale,  artificial  seafloor  hydrothermal  system
               equipped with a fiber optic viewing system.  This apparatus  will  be used to
              test the hypothesis that seafloor hydrothermal systems  can   abiotically 
              generate  small  organic  molecules  from  the  dissolved  carbonate  in
              hydrothermal fluids.   The  system  will  mimic  black  smoker  vents found in
              nature, enabling  continuous  injection of a 400  C hydrothermal fluid into
              cold seawater at  a  pressure of 250 bars.  The fiber optic viewing system will
               allow  observation of the vent and improve sample collection.   Sampling 
              tubes  located in the seawater vessel will be moveable at various  distances
              over the hydrothermal vent in order to sample  a  range  of 
              seawater-hydrothermal fluid mixing ratios.  Computer  control  of  temperature 
              and pressure and automatic data collection  will  also be added to the system.
