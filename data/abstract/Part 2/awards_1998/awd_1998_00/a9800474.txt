Abstract    :
              The objectives of this GOALI Faculty in Industry project are  to enhance and
              share understanding, between academia and  industry, of respective technical
              goals and constraints  related to vehicle powertrain systems, through
              collaborative  vehicular powertrain research  and technology transfer. The 
              technical focus of the project is to develop improved  control and diagnostic
              aspects of vehicle powertrain  systems, and  maintain system robustness within
              a highly  cost-sensitive environment. Another important objective of  this
              project is to gain an intimate knowledge of powertrain  research activities at
              several major European vehicle  research centers, and to better understand the
              industry  needs from the European perspective. The bulk of the work  will be
              carried out by Professor John J. Moskwa at the Ford  Research and Engineering
              Center in Laindon, Essex, England.  Funds are also provided to meet travel
              expenses to other  academic and industrial research groups within Europe. There
               will also be some research collaboration with the University  of Cambridge.
