              Title: Wavelength Division Multiplexing in Soliton Communications    Abstract  
               The proposed research is aimed at analytic and numerical studies of the
              wavelength division multiplexed soliton communication systems.  The issues to
              be addressed and analyzed include   four-wave interactions and associated
              resonant instabilities; collision induced time jitter; soliton controllability
              via frequency filters and dispersion management; systems implications of these
              effects and relevant additional perturbation effects.  Soliton communication
              has been recognized as a viable technique for high-speed very long distance
              transmission using optical fibers.  But, until the above mentioned issues are
              resolved, the commercial utilization of the potential advantage of soliton
              transmission cannot be realized.
