Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the Hirsch Conjecture which claims  that the
              edge-diameter of a (d,n)-polytope -- a d-polytope with n  facets -- is at most
              n-d.  The edge-diameter of the polyhedral  feasible region of a Linear Program
              is of interest since it  provides a lower bound on the worst-case behavior of
              any edge-  following Linear Programming algorithm.  Considerable research 
              effort has been expended in the past on the Hirsch Conjecture and  its
              relatives due to their crucial role in the quest to  understand and improve the
              worst case behavior of the Simplex  method.  Despite four decades of research
              however, even a polynomial upper  bound on the edge-diameter of a
              (d,n)-polytope has remained  elusive, and the Hirsch Conjecture and its
              relatives remain among  the most important unresolved problems in  the theory
              of Linear Programming.  In contrast to earlier attacks on the conjecture, which
              analyze  the combinatorial structure of polytopes, this research attempts  to
              determine whether or not the space of all Hirsch polytopes  (polytopes for
              which Hirsch Conjecture is true) is a proper  subspace of the space of all
              polytopes.  The research will study  the geometric properties of the space of
              Hirsch polytopes in an  attempt to determine if the complementary subspace of 
              counterexamples is empty.
