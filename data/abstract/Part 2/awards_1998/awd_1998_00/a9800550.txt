Abstract    :
              9800550  Oxley    The 1998 Gordon  Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion is 
              scheduled for July 5 to 11, 1998 at Colby-Sawyer College in  New London, New
              Hampshire.  The conference theme is  OMaterials Reliability Through Corrosion
              Research.O  Subject  areas include:  reliability of coatings for corrosion 
              prevention; reliability/corrosion predictive models; stress  corrosion cracking
              - models and experiments; corrosion  mechanisms and prevention in fluid
              delivery systems;  passivity - metals and semiconductors; pitting and crevice 
              corrosion - models and experiments; corrosion mechanisms and  prevention in
              atmospheric corrosion and the transportation  industry; and emerging areas in
              corrosion research.  The  conference features eighteen invited talks.  Nine of
              the  speakers are long-standing leaders in aqueous corrosion and  related
              fields; one is a younger scientist with a promising  new research program; the
              eight speakers yet to be selected  are a similar mix of senior leaders and
              newer entrants to  the field with emphasis on foreign scientists.  The 
              demographic mix of speakers and discussion leaders reflect  the worldwide
              community of people working in the field of  aqueous corrosion.  The discussion
              leaders are senior people  with in-depth knowledge of the session topic,
              experience in  the Gordon Research Conference format, and demonstrated  ability
              to stimulate vigorous discussion of the key issues  with broad audience
              participation.  The countries  represented by the speakers and discussion
              leaders are  include Germany, Britain, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden,  Australia,
              Canada, and France.  %%%  Aqueous corrosion is an important form of degradation
              in  metal alloys components.  This workshop addresses mechanisms  of aqueous
              corrosion with the purpose of improved  understanding of corrosion mechanisms
              and methods of  reducing this problem.  ***
