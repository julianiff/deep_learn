Abstract    :
              This work will exploit learning techniques recently developed to work towards
              computers that learn to detect and recognize people, estimate user's gestures
              and communicate visually with them via a photorealistic computer-generated
              human face.  In particular, the plan is to use tow main theoretical and
              algorithmic approaches to learning: Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov
              Models.  With these tools, two key aspects of a trainable man-machine interface
              will be developed:  An analysis module that can be trained to estimate in real
              time facial expressions of the user and associated physical parameters and a
              synthesis module that can be trained to generate image sequences of a real
              human face synchronized to a text-to-speech system.  The significance of the
              work is three-fold: (1) The project will contribute to the development of a new
              generation of computer interfaces more user-friendly and human-centered than
              today's interfaces.  Such interfaces will be of direct use in education and as
              components of prostheses for the disadvantaged; (2) The project will integrate
              recently developed learning techniques to real time vision and graphics
              applications; and (3) The project will explore the boundaries of what is
              possible to achieve using 2D representations of faces rather than the more
              common, physically-based, 3D-based models.
