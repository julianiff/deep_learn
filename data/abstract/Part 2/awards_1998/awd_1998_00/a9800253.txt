Abstract    :
              This grant supports the acquisition of a capillary electrophoresis system to be
              dedicated to environmental engineering research by the Environmental and Water
              Resources Program.  The capillary electrophoresis research package will
              compliment existing analytical techniques, such as liquid and gas
              chromatography, by providing a technique for the qualitative and quantitative
              study of biomolecules and charged organic compounds.  Compounds with this
              characteristic include, but are not limited to, enzymes, proteins,
              carbohydrates, fatty acids, humic and fulvic acids and surfactants.  These
              compound classes play key roles in the fate and treatment processes of
              hazardous chemicals.  Many of the research projects that are underway in the
              program involve these same processes.  This includes research on soil systems
              and microbial systems.  In order to understand the chemistry of these
              processes, one must be able to track the behavior of charged organic and
              biological compounds.  The addition of this research package will open the door
              to the analysis of these compounds, thereby uncovering the mechanisms that
              control the fate of a hazardous compound in these complexed systems.
