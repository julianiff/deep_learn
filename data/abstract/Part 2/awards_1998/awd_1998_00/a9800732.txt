Abstract    :
              Prof. Isenberg will continue a program of research which  focuses primarily on
              the study of the behavior of  cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations. 
              Employing  tools from geometrical analysis and nonlinear partial  differential
              equation theory, his research involves the  study of solutions of the Einstein
              constraint equations, the  study of long-time existence and behavior of
              solutions of  the Einstein field equations near singular regions as well  as
              near asymptotic expansion regions, and the study of  spacetimes with Cauchy
              horizons.  This research program also  includes analysis of other
              geometrically-based partial  differential equations, including Ricci flow and
              wave maps.  Einstein's field equations, besides providing the best  current
              description of the behavior of gravitational physics  on the astrophysical and
              cosmological scales, is also the  source of a rich collection of mathematically
              interesting  questions.  This project seeks support for a program of  research
              which focuses on some of these.  Part of the aim of  this proposed work is to
              increase the interaction of ideas  and tools in mathematics and theoretical
              physics.
