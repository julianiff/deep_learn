Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    Ralph Greenberg  University of Washington  98 00829    Professor
              Greenberg intends to study a variety of questions concerning local Galois
              cohomology groups, Selmer Groups and elliptic curves. Under his plan Galois
              cohomology will provide information about Selmer groups.  Selmer groups are key
              ingredients in our understanding of the arithmetic of elliptic curves.
              Professor Greenberg is ultimately interested in those points on elliptic curves
              that can be pinpointed using algebraic numbers.  Algebraic numbers are numbers
              that can be developed in a finite way from the integers we all learn in school.
               The Selmer Group is specifically designed to study these points.    In one
              view, elliptic curves are shaped like the surface of a donut.  In this view,
              simpler curves are like the surface of a sphere, a donut without a hole, and
              more complicated curves are like the surface of a donut with several holes. 
              The arithmetical properties of the simple curves have been extensively studied
              since ancient times.  The more complicated curves have such a restrictive
              arithmetic structure that simply counting the points on one is a difficult
              research problem.  The one hole donuts are, however, just right. They have a
              rich and mysterious structure which this project will explore. Their beautiful
              mathematical structure makes elliptic curves very useful in such practical
              problems as the digital encoding of information and the security of
              communications.
