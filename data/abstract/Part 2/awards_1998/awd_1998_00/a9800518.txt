Abstract    :
              When we design queue sizes, link bandwidths, and other network parameters, we
              assume   that successive packets are statistically independent.  We make this
              assumption because   (1) we don't have a good way to specify such dependencies,
              (2) our useful underlying   mathematical tools are based on this assumption,
              and (3) it has given us decent results.    However, in broadband and/or
              wide-area networks, it's no longer clear we're getting   decent results.  In
              this research project, the theory of Probabilistic Context-Free   Grammars is
              proposed as a tool for specifying statistical dependence among successive  
              packets in a network.  We will try to extend the underlying mathematics, the
              N-Type   Branching Process, so it can specify the queue sizes, link bandwidths,
              and other network   parameters.  Eventually, we will compare the specifications
              from the classical design and   from this new design to real measurements.   
              For the SGER component of this project, we will develop a convincing example. 
              This   example will show how a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar can be used
              to specify   statistical dependence among successive packets in a network.  It
              will illustrate how the   current state of the underlying mathematics (the
              N-Type Branching Process) can be used   to specify network parameters (packet
              queues, link bandwidths, etc.) more realistically   than does the classical
              design technique (that assumes packet independence).  This   illustrative
              example will be used in a follow-up proposal for an extended research project.
