Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to enhance the quantitative and qualitative
              reasoning skills of undergraduate students in the physical sciences through a
              variety of computational modeling techniques. We propose the formation of an
              interdisciplinary Scientific Computational Laboratory (SCL) at Yeshiva College.
              This will accomplish the following three objectives: 1) the integration of
              computer modeling into seven existing science courses; 2) the creation of three
              new science courses built around advanced computing; 3) the implementation of
              original student research projects requiring advanced computing under faculty
              supervision. The investigators will draw on their experience in computational
              methods and in introducing computing into the undergraduate curriculum.
