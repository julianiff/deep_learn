Abstract    :
                Understanding connections between processes that occur at different levels of
              organization is one of the greatest challenges facing undergraduate students in
              biology. This project involves two mechanisms aimed at improving student
              understanding of such connections. First, the particular tools requested in
              this proposal, a portable photosynthesis system, a portable spectroradiometer,
              and a multi-channel metabolism system, will allow students in two of our large
              core biology courses to integrate patterns at the population or community scale
              with processes of energy production and use at the organismal scale. Second,
              students will develop hands-on skills while using the instruments in an
              open-ended fashion, first learning their operation while testing
              instructor-generated hypotheses, and then testing their own hypotheses to
              refine their understanding of the physiological bases of ecological patterns.
              Two proposed labs that specifically link organismal biology with ecology are
              "The Light Fantastic: Photosynthetic Characteristics of Forest Plants and Their
              Consequences for Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Plant Communities" and
              "Energetic Strategies of Ectotherms and Endotherms, and Their Ecological
              Consequences". The instrumentation requested here will also be used to improve
              the quantitative and analytical sophistication of process skills and concepts
              taught in several additional courses for majors, and in an integrated
              science/mathematics general education course for non-majors.
