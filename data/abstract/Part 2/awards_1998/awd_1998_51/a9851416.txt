Abstract    :
              Due to the enormous importance of polymers and polymeric materials in today's
              society, a large fraction of scientists ends up working in the polymer/plastics
              industry. In light of this fact, chemistry majors and non-majors are being
              trained in the fundamentals of polymer chemistry in a new interdisciplinary
              course with an accompanying laboratory. The course has a decidedly industrial
              orientation, and is widely publicized among local polymer/plastics companies,
              for the benefit of industrial laboratory technicians. In offering the
              laboratory component of the course, a new Gel Permeation Chromatograph and a
              new Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer are being used along with existing polymer
              analysis instrumentation holdings.
