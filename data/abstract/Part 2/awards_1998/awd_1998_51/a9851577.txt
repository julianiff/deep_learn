Abstract    :
                This proposal is directed at enhancement of the undergraduate botany
              curriculum in the Biology Department at Western Washington University. A key
              feature of this effort is the development of a new course designed to encourage
              scientific inquiry, stimulate interest, and illustrate the scientific process,
              even as it teaches contemporary methods in plant developmental biology,
              including morphometric, cellular, biochemical, and molecular genetic
              techniques. This course, 'Projects in Plant Development'(Biol 453), is built
              around four modules of related lab skills, each used to address an 'original',
              open-ended question.  Additional goals are to improve the laboratory segment of
              Introductory Botany (Biol 203) by adding more quantitative exercises, and to
              update the Plant Physiology (Biol 479) laboratory, with a focus on
              investigating the principles of photosynthesis with modern instrumentation,
              using isolated chloroplasts and whole plants. These revisions are expected to
              better represent the many dimensions of the discipline, from organismal to
              cellular, and the several scientific approaches commonly employed, from the
              more reductionist analyses to whole plant studies.  New instrumentation would
              allow the formulation of more effective pedagogical approaches, and make it
              feasible to accommodate an expanded, and more contemporary, experimental
              repertoire. Support is sought for instruments that fall under three broad
              categories: image analysis software, photosynthesis measuring devices, and
              equipment for protein and nucleic acid analysis.
