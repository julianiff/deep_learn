Abstract    :
              Computers are widely used in problem solving, spectrum simulation, visualization
              of orbitals and reaction pathways, design of complex molecules and
              self-assembly molecules, and calculation of the minimum energy of a structure
              or transition state. To provide our undergraduates with practical experience in
              computers, we are integrating computer programs and practice into our
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Experiments in freshman chemistry courses
              include valence theory and visualization of orbital interference. Sophomore
              classes, Organic Chemistry Laboratories and General Organic Chemistry
              Laboratory, focus on the simulation of 1H and 13C NMR spectra, calculation of
              lowest energy organic structures, transition states, visualization of reaction
              mechanisms, and design of complex molecules. In the Junior year, Physical
              Chemistry II demonstrates computer modeling of chemical phenomena. In the
              senior year, computer simulation of basic electronic circuits and computer
              interfacing, computer simulation of IR and NMR spectra, and chromatographic
              separation are taught. A new course on supramolecular chemistry is being
              developed. It is estimated that over 4,000 students annually in our
              undergraduate program will be affected by the proposed project.
