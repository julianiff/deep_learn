Abstract    :
              This project supports a continuing revision of the traditional astronomy
              curriculum at Cloud County Community College. The curriculum is being
              structured so as to support a guided inquiry based approach to teaching
              astronomy to non-science majors. The equipment is tailored to facilitate
              students in using a hands-on, integrated approach that emphasizes discovery and
              investigation over rote memorization. This approach, with its emphasis on doing
              science rather than learning about what scientists have done, will stimulate
              students' interest in the subject, promote their understanding of how science
              is done and allow them to construct correct physical models about the laws that
              govern the universe. These goals will be accomplished by integrating the
              equipment with activities taken from existing sources (Project STAR or CLEA) or
              materials developed in house that allow the student to investigate the physical
              world through observation and interaction and from that, formulate ideas and
              models in collaboration with the instructor and classmates. The project is
              designed to continue the revision of the astronomy curriculum at Cloud using
              durable, relatively inexpensive equipment that is easy for the students to use
              and understand.
