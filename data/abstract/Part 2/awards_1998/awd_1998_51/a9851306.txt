Abstract    :
              This project will modernize equipment used in the instruction of physics and 
              support a newly created physics minor program. It will provide not only
              instrumentation required to provide students with laboratory experiences in
              Modern Physics, but also to change the way physics is taught by incorporating
              collaborative and inquiry-based pedagogical methods into the introductory
              courses.  To achieve the interrelated goals of creating and sustaining student
              interest in physics and improving student understanding of concepts in physics,
              we will implement a series of new laboratory exercises designed to actively
              engage students by providing them with immediate feedback through direct
              computer data acquisition and data analysis. This approach, which will be
              included in the introductory physics courses required of all science and
              mathematics majors as well as a new general education course in Cosmology, will
              significantly impact students' understanding and appreciation of the physical
              sciences.  This project directly supports and extends new, inquiry-based
              curricula implemented in other disciplines within the Division of Natural
              Sciences and Mathematics beginning in 1994, which emphasizes hands-on and
              collaborative problem solving as a way of learning.  Modernization in the
              instruction of physics will complement and balance recent advances in the
              experimentally-based study of biology and chemistry attained by the recent
              addition of modern equipment and laboratory experiences in these areas.
