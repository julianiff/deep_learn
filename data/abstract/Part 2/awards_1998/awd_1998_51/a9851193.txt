Abstract    :
                In order to better prepare students to meet the demand for environmental
              engineers with a wide range of expertise, laboratory courses are being revised
              to include the use of analytical equipment used throughout the industry. In
              this proposal, funds are requested to purchase a Hewlett Packard (HP) gas
              chromatograph (GC), headspace sampler, and data analysis and handling system.
              Purchase of the gas chromatograph would greatly enhance the undergraduate
              environmental engineering program by expanding the scope and material to which
              the students are exposed. The equipment will be used by students enrolled in
              undergraduate environmental engineering laboratory courses, by faculty run
              demonstrations, and by undergraduate students involved in student originated
              research projects.  The primary objective of the proposed project is to
              integrate the use of gas chromatography into the laboratories of three
              undergraduate courses in environmental engineering: Principles of Environmental
              Engineering (CE 170), Physical/Chemical Processes in Environmental Pollution
              Control (CE 175) and Biological Processes in Environmental Pollution Control
              (CE 176). The gas chromatograph will be used in CE 170 to teach the fundamental
              principles and general applications of gas chromatography. The development of
              laboratories that focus on the application of gas chromatography in the design
              and/or operation of a number of unit operations and unit processes will provide
              environmental engineering students enrolled in CE 175 and CE 176 a "hands-on"
              laboratory experience.
