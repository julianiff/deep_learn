Abstract    :
              Faculty members in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction and the
              Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU)
              are establishing an instructional program and a classroom dedicated to bringing
              the capabilities of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) into elementary and
              secondary classrooms. The goal of this program is to enhance student and
              teacher understanding and learning of the microscopic world around them. With
              the development of the Internet and remote-controlled SEMs, a unique
              opportunity now exists to facilitate children's access to extremely expensive,
              technologically advanced equipment via inexpensive Internet connections. The
              classroom will consist of an environmental SEM fully connected to the World
              Wide Web and the Internet. A summer training program involving present and
              pre-service teachers at the elementary and secondary levels will be conducted,
              instructing them on how to use the SEM in the classroom. Teachers will develop
              the lessons, which will vary in content and SEM access, depending upon grade
              level. Classroom teachers will receive instruction in the SEM's use and
              capabilities through a series of summer workshops. During the school year,
              pre-service elementary and secondary teachers who are specializing in science
              and mathematics will facilitate the classroom investigations.
