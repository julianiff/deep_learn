Abstract    :
                This proposal seeks matching funds from the NSF to support modification of a
              250 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for use in
              the undergraduate chemistry laboratories at UNM. At the present time there is
              no NMR instrument available for use by undergraduates in the department of
              chemistry. The addition of an NMR instrument will impact the educational
              experience of approximately 350 students per year at the sophomore, junior and
              senior levels. The four major laboratory courses targeted for immediate
              introduction to NMR experimentation include organic chemistry, chemistry lab
              III, synthesis and structure determination and instrumental analysis. The
              acquisition of an NMR spectrometer for these undergraduate laboratories will
              benefit students by improving and augmenting existing experiments in the
              curriculum and by allowing them hands-on experience with a modern, computer
              based instrument similar to research-grade instrumentation. It will also permit
              the addition of interesting and challenging experiments that are not
              implemented because their success and educational value relies heavily on the
              availability of an NMR.
