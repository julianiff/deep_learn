Abstract    :
                Bryn Mawr College has a highly successful strategy for introductory physics
              laboratory instruction involving a mixture of conceptual, quantitative and
              project-based experiments for small groups of students in a self-paced
              instructional format grounded in hands-on studies of macroscopic physical
              phenomena. Nearly 40% of the graduating students (all women) take one of three
              year-long courses in physics with associated laboratories or a conceptual
              physics course which takes advantage of the same laboratory apparatus. This
              program has successfully produced over the last ten years one of largest cadres
              of women physics majors in the nation.  This project introduces computer-aided
              data acquisition, display, and analysis as well as experimental control into
              the introductory laboratories. The new capabilities afforded by such
              instrumentation strengthen the three-phase laboratory structure used in the
              program.    NSF Form 1295 (10/94)
