Abstract    :
                  Through this project a new computer facility is being developed to: 1)
              support  the use of multimedia materials at all levels, and 2) provide senior
              students tools that will enhance their employability.  From a time early in the
              decade of the 1980s, the department has employed computers to assist students
              in visualizing the mathematics concepts taught.  However, the department has
              recently found itself unable to avail itself of modern multimedia tools in
              instruction, either in preparing students for a progressively more
              computer-oriented job market or in making the earliest courses more palatable
              to wary students.  Moreover, students are not using equipment that is even
              remotely similar to what they will likely use after they graduate.  This
              project represents an attempt to address this concern.
