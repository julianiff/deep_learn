Abstract    :
                Andrew College is a small, rural, private, two-year liberal arts college
              located in Randolph County, Georgia, a county ranked at the very bottom of the
              socio-economic indicator scale for the state and nation. The problems that are
              being addressed by this NSF project are low student academic performance and
              low enrollments in mathematics courses at Andrew College. New instructional
              technologies are required to improve student performance in math and to
              increase student options for transfer to four-year colleges and universities.
              The objective of the project is to develop a new course in mathematical
              modeling with calculator-based laboratory which will lead to: (1) grade
              distributions of the math courses in line with or better than the total college
              grade distribution and (2) increases in the numbers of students who enroll in
              non-requisite math courses. The methods that are being used to accomplish the
              objectives are to (1) provide release time for the Project Director (PD) to
              complete the syllabus for the mathematical modeling course and CBL laboratory
              experiences, (2) acquire the CBL equipment, (3) provide training for the PD and
              other math faculty to teach the new course, (4) publicize the new course in the
              college catalog and other publications, (5) conduct formative and summative
              evaluation of project activities to measure changes in grade distributions and
              enrollment in non-requisite math courses, and (6) disseminate the results of
              the project. The special audiences targeted by the project are the high
              percentage of rural, first generation, low-income, and minority students
              enrolled at Andrew College, high school mathematics teachers and 50 Upward
              Bound participants--all of whom come from six local county school systems
              ranked the lowest in the state of Georgia. The results of the project are being
              disseminated through workshops for teachers, regional and state math
              conferences, in math journals and newsletters, and through publications
              targeted to liberal arts colleges .
