Abstract    :
              This project is a novel design for an undergraduate neuroscience laboratory. 
              Students will work at computer anchored research stations that control
              peripheral devices that monitor and record data from both operant and open
              field/maze environments, and also will permit virtual experimentation. The
              laboratory development coincides with institutional curriculum revisions       
                that will increase the utilization and curricular use of laboratory
              facilities. The equipment adds the important dimension of computer and
              technological competencies to the skills acquired in the laboratory.     This
              project is also a Beta Test site for Yale University's Neuron virtual
              experimentation software, and will build on prior work undertaken under NSF/
              DUE support on neural networks.
