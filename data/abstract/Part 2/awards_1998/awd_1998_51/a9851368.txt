Abstract    :
               Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy is one of the most effective tools
              available in the modern chemistry laboratory for identifying chemical
              compounds. The objective of this project is the educate science (chemistry,
              biology, environmental science) majors, and selected non-science majors in the
              theory and use of this technique. The introduction of FT-IR instrumentation and
              theory into introductory and selected advanced courses is described.
              Introductory courses will stress functional group identification, while the
              more advanced courses will investigate spectroscopy theory, instrument
              optimization and quantitative analysis. The use of DRIFT (diffuse reflectance)
              spectroscopy and IR microscopy to examine real, interesting samples (e.g., shoe
              heels, golf ball covers, soda bottles) benefits students in a variety of
              courses in the targeted disciplines.  In addition to the students at
              Randolph-Macon College, primary and secondary school students using resources
              of the local Mathematics and Science Center benefit from this equipment.
