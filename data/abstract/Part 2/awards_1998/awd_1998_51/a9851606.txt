Abstract    :
               As one way of demonstrating a connection between discovery and knowledge the
              Project Director's current research program on Taxol is being incorporated into
               a general cell biology laboratory course for undergraduate biology majors. The
              course: (1) challenges students to explore new frontiers in biology, (2)
              engages the interests of students and make them exited about what they are
              learning, (3) teaches them important fundamental biological principles, the use
              of modern instruments, techniques and critical reasoning and problem-solving
              skills, and (4) encourages active participation and collaborative learning. The
              Project-based experimental modules include: cell isolation, purification,
              culturing with associated immunocyto chemical techniques; the action of taxol
              on cytoskeletal assembly/ disruption, receptor binding, signal transduction
              pathway, receptor-mediated endocytosis, vesicular transport, cell cycle and
              apoptosis; computer modeling and drug design.  A problem-based learning manual
              is being developed, tested and disseminated to the scientific community through
              the Internet and scientific or educational publications.
