Abstract    :
                  One of the primary educational missions of Grinnell's Anthropology
              Department is to teach students scientific method and research skills. Two
              archaeology courses with a full 3-hour weekly lab in addition to regular
              lectures and discussion have been developed to provide students with the
              opportunity to conduct experiments and do individual and collaborative
              research. In addition, independent study is offered to advanced students.    
              In this project, the department will enhance the available laboratory equipment
              through the addition of stereo-microscopes and attachments, hot plates,
              thermocouple thermometers, a scale, digital calipers, and miscellaneous
              glassware. This equipment will broaden the types of research that students will
              be able to undertake. For example, it will allow them to conduct experiments in
              use-wear and ceramic materials analysis.
