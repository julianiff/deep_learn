Abstract    :
               The proposal will establish a model computer laboratory for undergraduate
              computer science students to develop graphical user interface applications and
              explore advanced graphics rendering algorithms. User interface students will
              develop interactive teaching tools as a team project for a capstone course.
              Computer graphics students will develop animations and distributed rendering
              algorithms. The laboratory will contain twelve Pentium machines with two
              operating systems: Windows NT and Linux. The machines will be configured in a
              high speed local area network to support interactive client-server and
              distributed applications. Software will include Windows development
              environments, Linux, and graphics libraries. All teaching materials developed
              for this project will be disseminated widely.
