Abstract    :
                This project is improving the mathematics understanding and retention of more
              than 400 students per semester. A Microcomputer Based Laboratory is being set
              up with 10 stations, each equipped with a Power Mac 7600 multimedia computer
              with videocard and monitor, an interface to change analog to digital signal, a
              set of 10 sensing devices, an attached video camera, and a storage disk drive,
              and a TI Graph Link for transfer of data from the lab computer to students'
              individual TI graphing calculators. A portable camcorder and tripod are being
              used for experiments not feasible within the laboratory. Each math class has at
              least two MBL collaborative learning labs per semester with their instructor
              and several additional collaborative lab assignments. The PI and the full time
              math faculty are developing the lab materials during the summers of 1998 and
              1999 as part of a complete redesign of the math curriculum begun in 1996-97.
              This project was conceived as a result of the success of the MBL in physics
              project developed by the PI during the past three and a half years. The visual,
              tactile, collaborative learning made possible by MBL and digital video analysis
              capture students' attention, allay math anxiety, and greatly enhance the
              learning of a large number of students whose learning style is other than
              auditory. Pilot testing and revisions are being done each semester. Baseline
              data from the two years prior to project implementation are being compared with
              students data during the two years of grant activity. Anecdotal data is
              collected as well. Results and lab manuals are disseminated through regional
              and national conferences, by mail, and via the internet.
