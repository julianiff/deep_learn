Abstract    :
               A specialized instructional laboratory will be constructed to support a new
              computer course for non-computer science majors. The course will  teach
              students with a background as users of productivity tools such as Microsoft:
              Office 97 how to program in that environment. Students will learn how to
              construct stand-alone applications as well as applications that can run on the
              Internet and on local Intranets.    The laboratory will consist of thirty
              networked stations connected to the instructor's console by a device (the Tech
              Commander) that will enable her to see and interact with each student station
              from the console. This will also allow the instructor to take over any
              workstation interact with it and broadcast it for class discussion.    The
              proposed course and laboratory will produce a new group of subject area
              specialists who will be able to create applications usually requiring
              professional programmers or computer consultants. This will affect productivity
              in the workplace by bringing high level technology to a much wider group of
              people. It will also affect the careers of the students taking it by virtue of
              their increased knowledge and skill
