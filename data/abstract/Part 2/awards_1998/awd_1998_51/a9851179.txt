Abstract    :
                A Computational Chemistry Laboratory will be established for undergraduate
              chemistry students at Wartburg College. Instruction in introductory chemistry,
              organic chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry and advanced inorganic
              chemistry will be enhanced through the use of the computer lab. All levels of
              classes will use the CAChe WorkSystem molecular modeling computer package. At
              the upper division level, students will have access to research quality
              computer packages, UniChem and Iditis. Laboratory courses will incorporate
              molecular modeling and students will examine the properties of compounds
              synthesized or measured in the labs. The first year Computational Chemistry
              Laboratory will impact approximately 240 chemistry students, 85 percent of whom
              will major in the sciences.
