Abstract    :
                A novel course called "Molecular Biology for Teachers",  team taught by
              science educators and a molecular biologist, provides preservice teachers
              training in the following: (1) theory of molecular biology, (2) hands-on
              laboratory techniques appropriate for the curricular needs of 6-12 schools and
              their limited resources, (3) adapting existing biotechnology lessons and
              critical evaluation of popular "prepackaged" programs, (4) performance
              assessment of student skills and evaluation of student content knowledge.
              Outcomes include enthused, confident, and skilled 6-12 science teachers who
              then engender in their students improvements in science literacy and interest
              in science careers. The course is being developed, implemented and team-taught
              at Central Washington University (CWU) by faculty in Biology, Chemistry and
              Science Education.  Students are eligible to continue research in this area,
              and, once they graduate, are eligible to borrow equipment kits for use in their
              6-12 classrooms. An advisory board of individuals experienced in delivering
              molecular biology education for in-service 6-12 teachers provides added
              expertise.
