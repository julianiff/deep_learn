Abstract    :
                We propose to develop four laboratory projects in microelectronics and thin
              film optics which will be incorporated into the advanced and sophomore level
              physics laboratories at McAlester College. Currently, our students have
              difficulty making the connection between the theoretical physics encountered in
              textbooks and the exciting technological fields of microelectronics and
              materials science. The labs we seek to develop will provide a context for
              research based exploration of electrostatics, modern physics and solid-state
              physics, and provide an introduction to the principles of semiconductor device
              fabrication. Students will fabricate working semiconductor devices, such as
              Schottky diodes and Field Effect transistors and investigate the basic physics
              which describes them. Students will also explore the optical properties of thin
              dielectric and metal films. The total cost of this project is $50,250. We are
              requesting $25,125 from the National Science Foundation.
