Abstract    :
               A consortium of the three primarily undergraduate universities in Tacoma,
              Washington is introducing fluorescent automated sequencing and genotyping to
              their students. The sequencer/genotyper allows introduction of labs that engage
              majors in the collection and analysis of original data. Although the sequencer
              is used most heavily for junior/senior level labs (212 students/year) and in
              senior thesis or capstone projects (20 40 students/year), it is also used to
              enhance the undergraduate experience at all levels. Freshmen and students in
              the non-majors biology courses (596 students/year) are introduced to the
              techniques of molecular biology through a population study of local salmon
              species. Both majors and non-majors in classes that emphasize the connection
              between science and society (190 students/year) are genotyping themselves or
              sequencing a portion of their own DNA, an exercise that helps them to
              understand the technology and how it is used.  In the upper-level electives,
              each college is implementing focused research projects that will allows
              students to design and carry out original research during the course. Most of
              these research projects are directly related to Pacific Northwest organisms or
              ecological problems. The data generated is useful to government agencies and
              community groups in the area. Research students and principal investigators at
              all three institutions also present papers and posters at regional and national
              meetings; thus disseminating the results of this project to the scientific and
              educational communities.
