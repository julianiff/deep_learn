Abstract    :
              Computational chemistry is used extensively in biochemical research in
              applications ranging from the design of potential new drugs to the structural
              characterization of macromolecules. Yet, most undergraduate biochemistry
              curricula do not include this vital discovery tool. Instead, students typically
              perform wet chemistry laboratories with little consideration for molecular
              level interactions. This project addresses this deficiency by exposing students
              to macromolecules and their interactions both experimentally and
              computationally. We are integrating computational calculations with
              corroborating experimental investigation, utilizing the new workstations,
              software and spectrophotometers. Completion of the proposed laboratory
              exercises enhances students' understanding of how the molecular structure of
              macromolecules is related to physiological function and observed experimental
              results. These laboratories should be of interest to educators who are
              searching for new approaches to teaching important biochemical concepts and
              relationships. The results of the project are being disseminated though
              presentation at a national American Chemical Society meeting and through
              publication both in chemical education journals and in a biochemistry
              laboratory manual.
