Abstract    :
                       An undergraduate neurobiology laboratory i being upgraded to allow
              computer-based data acquisition and analysis, as well as allow students to
              perform intracellular recordings. These two improvements promote exploration of
              neurobiological concepts and techniques, and broaden the impact of the
              laboratory course by facilitating demonstrations by the students in the
              laboratory course to neurobiology students in the lecture-only class.
              Additionally, the exercises made possible with the requested equipment provide
              practice with problem-probing and persuasion skills, as the students will
              design experiments, collect data and prepare presentations of their results for
              their peers.  The computer-based data acquisition and analysis system
              significantly improves the laboratory by permitting quantification of data,
              decreases the time to set up experiments, and allows students to focus on the
              concepts under investigation.  In addition, this equipment facilitates student
              research projects. These laboratory improvements are initially impacting
              several groups of students: those in the laboratory course, those taking the
              lecture course without the laboratory, and students who wish to perform
              undergraduate research.  It is hoped that this project will also improve
              undergraduate laboratory experiences for all biology majors at the University,
              as the techniques found to be successful are adopted by other instructors.
