Abstract    :
                The current departmental NMR spectrometer is a Bruker AC 250 configured as a
              proton/carbon fixed frequency, computer switchable instrument with a 5 mm probe
              that operates only at ambient temperature. This proposed project seeks to
              modify the existing instrument for multinuclear operation from 109Ag to 31p,
              and for variable temperature operation from -150 to + 150  C. These
              enhancements were not requested in the original NSF-ILI proposal which
              partially funded the purchase of the spectrometer because (1) the PI for the
              current proposal was not a faculty member in the department at that time and,
              (2) it was felt by the PI and co-PI's of that earlier proposal that the
              university would NOT be willing to cost share the additional amount that the
              current proposed enhancements would have added to that original proposal. The
              courses for which the multinuclear and variable temperature instrument
              enhancements will have the greatest benefit are Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory,
              Experimental Physical Chemistry and Directed Research (undergraduate research).
              The underlying premise in the incorporation of NMR techniques and applications
              into these later upper division courses is that the experience students gained
              using 1H and 13C NMR in the earlier, higher enrollment, upper division
              laboratory courses such as Organic Chemistry II and Instrumental Analysis will
              permit the use of more sophisticated NMR experiments in those later upper
              division courses. Several new laboratory experiments using the modified NMR
              spectrometer are proposed, and when implemented and tested would be published
              in the appropriate journals.
