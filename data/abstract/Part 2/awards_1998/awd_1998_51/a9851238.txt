Abstract    :
              Nanotechnology involves the study of structures and processes which occur at the
               nanometer length scale. This relatively new field has impacted many areas of
              basic and applied science, and is projected to produce future changes which
              will profoundly effect  the lives of everyone.     This project incorporates
              into the Towson University curriculum experiments which provide students with
              an understanding of nanotechnology  principles and applications. A commercially
              available scanning probe microscope is used to perform these experiments. This
              instrument, which is capable of acting as a scanning tunneling microscope as
              well as an atomic force microscope,  fulfills immediate needs in existing
              laboratory courses, provides independent research projects for  undergraduates,
              and allows the development of new courses.
