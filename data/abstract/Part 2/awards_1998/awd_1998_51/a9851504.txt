Abstract    :
                Through the project, a unique instructional laboratory facility will be made
              available to a large number of undergraduate science and engineering students
              across the nation. The Networked Instructional Instrumentation Facility at the
              University of Illinois at Chicago allows students to access, via the Internet,
              a real laboratory in which undergraduate electronics laboratory experiments may
              be performed. At the hub is a measurement server, a hardware and software
              facility developed at UIC, that responds to measurement requests in the form of
              SPICE netlists, currently used in many undergraduate courses for circuit
              simulation. This unique facility allows the student to compare simulated
              results with actual measurements on a library of devices and circuits and also
              to perform experiments on circuits that are difficult to simulate. Students see
              the results within a few seconds and can submit new measurement requests based
              upon their interpretation of the results and under the guidance of
              instructional materials produced at UIC and at other universities that use the
              facility. The project includes a major outreach effort to assist science and
              engineering instructors across the country in the preparation of instructional
              materials utilizing the facility.
