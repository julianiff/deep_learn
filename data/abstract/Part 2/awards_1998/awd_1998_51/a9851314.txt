Abstract    :
                The goal of the project is to integrate rapid prototyping into a fully
              networked CAD/CAM/Engineering environment while fostering shared use of
              equipment and curriculum collaboration between collegedepartments. Rapid
              prototyping is a key and final element in the full integration of computer
              technology in the teaching of the manufacturing process at Moraine Valley C.
              C., from initial concept to final delivery of the product.The major objectives
              of the project are: (1) to improve the learning environment by revising
              curricula in seven courses to include exposing approximately 300 students each
              semester to rapid prototyping in a modern laboratory; (2) to develop an
              interactive rapid prototyping laboratory that will enable hands on learning
              experiences for high school teachers from the twelve secondary schools that
              form the Moraine Area Career System (MACS) partnership; (3) to provide learning
              experiences for high school students through the MACS, and (4) to sponsor a
              two-part symposium incorporating distance learning and a hands on learning
              experience in rapid prototyping technology for faculty from thirteen colleges
              and universities plus seven additional high schools that form the South Met
              EdNet Consortium partnership.The immediate goal is to upgrade the technical
              content of the curriculum by incorporating rapid prototyping in the two college
              departments. New program outcomes move student learning from a design step with
              3D geometric models to an actual prototype of the manufactured part followed by
              analysis and refinement of the product. Students will engage in the learning   
              experience in a real-world rapid prototyping environment.
