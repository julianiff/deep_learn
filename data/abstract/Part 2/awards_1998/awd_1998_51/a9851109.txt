Abstract    :
                This project  upgrades and modernizes  three undergraduate courses: Computer
              Networks and Distributed Systems (CS576), Client-Server programming (CS580) and
              Computer Simulation (CS558), which have a total enrollment of 80 undergraduate
              and 45 graduate students. The upgrades reflect the modern trends in computer
              networking and distributed systems, including distributed simulation. Most of
              the additions to the courses are focused on understanding, usage and analysis
              of high speed networks based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. In
              order to provide extended training and laboratory experience, a new ATM
              laboratory will be developed.  The laboratory is designed so that it can
              support all three courses, their current curricula, and the newly proposed
              upgrades. Major equipment for the new laboratory includes: two UltraSPARC 170E
              workstations and 17 Pentium-based workstations equipped with ATM interfaces an
              ATM switch an Ethernet switch, and one ATM network analyzer. Each workstation
              will be dual-bootable with a choice of Windows NT and the Linux operating
              system to increase the flexibility and usage of laboratory resources. Seven
              pilot projects are proposed to facilitate an early usage of the proposed
              laboratory and initiate the undergraduate research. The projects cover all
              important aspects of additions to all three courses.
