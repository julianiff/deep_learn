Abstract    :
                Students have great difficulty making the conceptual transition from the
              macrocopic to the microscopic world. We propose to develop and disseminate a
              collection of materials to introduce a revolutionary teaching microscope, the
              video-probe microscope, into introductory college science classrooms to help
              students make this transition. The efficiency and dramatic effect of this
              instrument was demonstrated in a previous, pilot LaSER Grant, Exploring
              Microstructures: Introducing Biology Students and Teachers to Images, Tools and
              Applications of High-Tech Microscopy  NSF/LaSER (1991) . This technologically
              advanced microscope consists of a tiny, hand-held, self-illuminated video
              camera with interchangeable magnifying lenses attached by a hybrid fiber
              optic/electronic cable to a controller box which in turn connects to a
              television monitor. By touching the tip of the lens to any object under
              scrutiny, a user of any age or ability immediately produces a well-lighted,
              in-focus image of the appropriate magnification on a regular television
              monitor. This tool will be invaluable in stimulating investigation in our
              undergraduate biology and earth science laboratories, particularly for
              non-science majors. Video recordings can be made in the normal fashion.
