Abstract    :
              This project continues to develop the highly successful Automated Telescope
              Facility (ATF) at the University of Iowa. The ATF program is an innovative new
              approach to the teaching of observational astronomy in undergraduate
              laboratories. It allows students access to modern astronomical instrumentation
              using Web and Windows-based user-friendly interfaces for schedule preparation,
              image display, and analysis.    The ATF is primarily used to teach
              undergraduate students how to conduct scientific research in observational
              astronomy. More than 700 students utilize this facility every year. The ATF
              allows a large number of students to schedule observations of astronomical
              targets such as planets, stars, and galaxies. The students plan all details of
              the observations, submit observing requests, and analyze the resulting images
              shortly after they are taken.  The project significantly enhances the
              capabilities of the ATF in four ways.    o It replaces the existing CCD Camera
              with a newer model with much better thermal stability and spectral sensitivity.
                 o It adds a spectrograph, which will allow measurements of stellar spectra
              for the first time.    o It adds a faster telescope control computer, allowing
              faster disks and better tracking. In addition, it adds three additional
              workstations for use by upper-level undergraduates in advanced laboratory
              course.    o It adds a writeable CD-ROM for archiving the image database
              generated by the ATF.
