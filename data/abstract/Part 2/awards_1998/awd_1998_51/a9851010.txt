Abstract    :
              The analytical instrumentation purchased through this grant supports a newly
              established Environmental Studies Program. An ion chromatograph, atomic
              absorption spectrometer, infrared spectrometer, gas chromatography-mass
              spectrometer and portable photosynthesis system also enhance the curricula in
              chemistry, biology and other sciences.  The college's environmental science
              major combines science and policy to address real, regional environmental
              problems.  The majority of students come from and return to Appalachian
              communities.  Thus many of them will become involved in environmental science
              and policy decisions affecting the Appalachian region.  The new instrumentation
              provides hands-on experiences with current for students that allow them to
              obtain the information required to address local and regional environmental
              problems.  The addition of this instrumentation strengthens the Environmental
              Studies Program and its cooperative agreements with local industries and
              government agencies.  These agreements provide students with meaningful on
              campus experiences and internships.
