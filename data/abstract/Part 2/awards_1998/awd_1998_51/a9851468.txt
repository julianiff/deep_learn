Abstract    :
                A spectrofluorimeter will be purchased by the Department of Chemistry at
              Millersville University of Pennsylvania. The instrument will be used in
              laboratory experiments for the following undergraduate courses: Polymer
              Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry (3 courses), Analytical Chemistry
              and Instrumental Analysis. Approximately 180 students per year will benefit
              from this equipment. Novel laboratory experiments using the instrument are
              being developed. The equipment will also be used for undergraduate research.
              Acquisition of a spectrofluorimeter will contribute to the ongoing development
              of an Option in Polymer Chemistry at Millersville, and will be part of a
              continuing effort on the part of the Chemistry Department to serve students
              better by improving equipment holdings for undergraduate laboratories and for
              undergraduate research.
