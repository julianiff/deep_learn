Abstract    :
                The project Improvements in Environmental Sciences laboratory for majors has
              four main objectives:  1. Teach the analytical techniques and data analysis
              methods necessary for environmental measurements.  2. Teach the
              interdisciplinary nature of environmental systems.  3 . Prepare students to
              pursue undergraduate research projects in environmental science by allowing
              them to take an investigative approach in their course work.  4. Increase
              student participation in and satisfaction with the environmental science
              program.  To meet these goals, three specific experiments are planned for the
              upper division laboratory course for majors: one to study the effects of engine
              conditions and fuel types on automobile exhaust, a second to study of global
              warming, and a third to study chemical transport and fate in the unsaturated
              zone. These new experiments are designed to stimulate student interest in
              pursuing original undergraduate research projects, by addressing current topics
              in environmental science in an interdisciplinary way.
