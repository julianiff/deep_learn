Abstract    :
              This project will establish four laboratories for the elementary teacher
              preparation program at Western Michigan University.  One laboratory will be
              used for the physical sciences, one for the earth sciences, and a third for the
              life sciences.  The fourth laboratory will be used by students to work on
              lessons and projects outside of class time and will also be used as a commons
              room.    Six science content courses, two in each of the three broad areas
              above, for prospective elementary teachers have been developed with borrowed
              equipment and with FIPSE support.  These courses together with a "capstone"
              course currently being developed will be offered in the new laboratories.   
              This laboratory and the courses it will support is an important component in
              the evolution of Western Michigan's elementary teacher preparation program. 
              The program currently graduates over 250 elementary teachers each year and will
              prepare teachers who will be able to teach in line with both the content and
              pedagogical standards outlined in the Michigan Essential Goals and Objectives
              of Science Education (MEGOSE) and advocated by several recent national studies.
