Abstract    :
              This project is creating an astronomy laboratory facility that introduces modern
              data acquisition and image processing techniques to introductory and advanced
              students at Smith College. The facility consists of a professional-grade
              telescope of modest aperture (16 inches), a solid state (charge coupled device)
              imaging camera, and computers for telescope control, data acquisition and
              analysis. This facility makes a dramatic change in the laboratory experiences
              for students. The facility is the centerpiece for a new set of laboratory
              courses designed to bring interactive, inquiry-based learning to both
              non-science and science students, and to introduce them to the excitement and
              power of digital imaging techniques. This facility will be used each year by
              over 100 introductory students, 5 to 10 advanced students, and 50 high school
              girls participating in the Smith Summer Science Program.
