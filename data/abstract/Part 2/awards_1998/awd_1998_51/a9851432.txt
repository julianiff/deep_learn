Abstract    :
                The Technology Department of Three Rivers Community-Technical College(TRCTC)
              is enhancing its curriculum in Photonics Engineering Technology through the
              development of a Lightwave Communications Laboratory. Thederegulation and
              globalization of the telecommunications industry has resulted in a rapid
              increase in the demand for technicians educated in lightwave communications. A
              recent federally funded study predicted that the demand for photonics
              technicians, including fiber optics technicians, would nearly double to 740,000
              by the year 2000. A meeting of the Connecticut Photonics Industry Cluster inthe
              Spring of 1997 described a critical need for technicians in the state, and
              urged that fiber optics programs at the State's Community-Technical Colleges be
              strengthened. To address this need, the Lightwave Communications Laboratory is
              providing students with experience with a state-of-the-art fiber optic
              communication system.  Each station emulates a "real world" lightwave
              communication system, capable of transmitting multi-gigabit information through
              several kilometers of optical fiber.  The opportunity to gain hands-on
              experience better prepares students for careers in photonics or
              telecommunications or to pursue additional studies at the baccalaureate level.
