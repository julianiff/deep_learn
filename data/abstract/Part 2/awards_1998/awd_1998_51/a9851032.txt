Abstract    :
                St. Mary's College of Maryland will purchase a Hewlett Packard Gas
              Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer, model 6890/5973, to improve laboratory
              instruction for students in general chemistry, nonmajors chemistry,
              quantitative and instrumental analysis, organic chemistry and biochemistry
              courses. This instrument would also serve to enhance the resources available to
              students fulfilling the eight credit general curriculum required research
              project, referred to as the St. Mary's Project in chemistry. The instrument
              will also be available for undergraduate research. At present the college has
              no mass spectral capabilities, and due to our rural location, the nearest
              possible site for collaboration is greater than an hour's drive away.
