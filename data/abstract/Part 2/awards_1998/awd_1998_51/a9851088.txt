Abstract    :
                Digital signal processing (DSP) is an important component of the GMI
              electrical engineering curriculum. An elective DSP course is selected by 40% of
              the EE students. However, the DSP curriculum does not currently have a
              laboratory component. A practical, hands-on laboratory is critical for teaching
              applied DSP and lends a physical credibility to classroom topics. We propose
              that a DSP laboratory be established at GMI. The laboratory includes hardware
              and software for digital signal processing. Students perform seven laboratory
              experiments using a Texas Instruments TMS320C30 general purpose digital signal
              processor and the Hewlett-Packard HP35665A dynamic signal analyzer. Each
              laboratory features an important application of DSP to physical systems.
              Hypersignal R DE software is used for filter design, simulation and
              implementation of real-time DSP algorithms. The experiments include fundamental
              investigations of the effects of sampling and quantization on the signal to
              noise ratio of a sampled signal. Students investigate practical issues such as
              the effect of filter structure on numerical stability. The experiments also
              incorporate biomedical, audio and video signals in investigations of filter
              design, system modeling and two-dimensional signal analysis. Equipment
              requested in this proposal primarily impacts undergraduate students at GMI
              enrolled in the DSP course. Also, the equipment will be used in the
              undergraduate capstone design project and community outreach programs including
              "Engineering and Science for the 21st Century Woman", the Boy Scouts of America
              "Explorers" program, "Discover GMI" days, and other activities that promote
              engineering and sciences.
