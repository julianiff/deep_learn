Abstract    :
                        The goals of this project are to improve students' understanding of
              chemistry concepts, improve retention rates, increase student enrollment in
              chemistry, and provide a modern laboratory experience by combining
              computer-interfaced sensor technology and laboratory-based Internet research
              within a collaborative-learning laboratory model. The ability to collect and
              analyze data using computers, query chemical databases on the Internet, and
              visualize chemical phenomena provides powerful support for more open-ended
              collaborative laboratory investigations.  The project uses 18 IBM compatible
              multimedia computers plus one file server equipped with Internet and intranet
              networking hardware and software in the chemistry laboratory. The computer
              network is available to students through connections on and off campus for
              consulting with other students around the world, visualizing molecular models
              and mechanism animations, and researching chemical data bases for answers to
              their independent questions. Analog to digital converters for each computer
              allow for experimental data to be collected and analyzed in real time. Students
              improve their chemistry and communication skills as they collaborate in the
              laboratory setting and as they integrate chemical research, prose, and
              laboratory investigations into their assignments.
