Abstract    :
                The main goal of this project is to significantly improve the manner in which
              controls is learned by undergraduates at Arizona State University (ASU). With a
              team of faculty from Electrical Engineering (EE), Mechanical and Aerospace
              Engineering (MAE), and Mathematics (MAT), this will be accomplished by
              developing a new multidisciplinary Modeling, Simulation, Animation, and
              Real-Time Control (MoSART) laboratory facility. While the facility will
              primarily serve juniors and seniors taking a new multidisciplinary lab-based
              control sequel, it will also serve sophomores in differential equations
              providing essential exposure to fundamental system and controls concepts. The
              new three-course sequence--designed to unify and properly integrate existing
              courses and laboratories--consists of Feedback Control Design for Dynamic
              Systems, Design of Real-Time Feedback Control Systems, and a Senior Control
              System Design Capstone Option.
