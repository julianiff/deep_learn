Abstract    :
                A microcomputer-based laboratory is being used to introduce an inquiry-based
              curriculum into the general physics sequence. The student population of the
              course is approximately half science majors and half secondary education
              majors. While one of the motivations for the project is to improve the all of
              the students' understanding of basic physics by using and adapting the well
              tested Workshop Physics curriculum, there is a particular focus on the
              pre-service secondary teachers in the course. This focus consists of having
              "alumni" of the general physics sequence return as peer instructors in both the
              workshop physics course and the conceptual physics course designed for
              non-majors. This is being done by having the physics and secondary education
              faculty work together to effect program changes that would require the
              secondary education students to have this teaching experience as an internship
              that would count towards their degree in education. The goals are to further
              improve the understanding of physics of these science teachers-to-be and to
              give them some practical experience with an inquiry-based physics curriculum.
