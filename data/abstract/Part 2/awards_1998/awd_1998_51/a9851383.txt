Abstract    :
                Undergraduate education in Structural Engineering lacks sufficient integration
              of full-scale testing into structural design courses. This is true of all
              undergraduate programs we investigated; students experiment with structural
              materials, but not with structural components. many state of the art design
              procedures for structures in steel, reinforced concrete, masonry, and wood are
              based on specific aspects of behavior that would be simple to illustrate in a
              properly equipped lab, but which are otherwise never seen by the students. 
              Allowing the students to plan and conduct tests which demonstrate the behavior
              of structural components to failure will have a direct impact on their ability
              to understand the specific concepts illustrated in the tests - and also on
              their motivation to learn related concepts. We believe that the reason this is
              not done is that no university has appropriate equipment devoted to such use in
              undergraduate programs.  The equipment described in this proposal will be used
              to conduct tests of full-scale structural components in advanced undergraduate
              structural design classes. The tests will illustrate the most critical concepts
              affecting design procedures. Specimens will be constructed by students in a
              sophomore level lab class,   giving these students a real object to construct
              and also providing continuity between the years of study. The equipment will
              also be used by Construction Management students to evaluate construction
              processes.
