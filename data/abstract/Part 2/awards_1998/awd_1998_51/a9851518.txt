Abstract    :
                The goal of this project is to allow physics majors at Grinnell College to
              work with fundamental concepts of solid-state physics through the application
              of modern experimental techniques to problems of interest to practicing
              physicists. This project is a logical extension of earlier efforts that
              culminated in the acquisition of a flexible materials testing instrument, which
              has been used to integrate solid-state physics experiments into the department'
              s sophomore- and senior-level lab courses. The department is using several
              upgrades to enhance the capabilities of this instrument. Thus enhanced, the
              materials testing instrument makes possible three significant curricular
              developments. First, it permits the introduction of heat capacity measurements
              into the curriculum in both the sophomore- and senior-level lab courses.
              Second, it allows the modification of existing experiments in these courses to
              explore anisotropic phenomena in a two-dimensional electron gas and in
              high-temperature superconductors. Third, it enables students contemplating
              independent research projects in solid-state physics to choose from a wider
              range of options. The success of this project is evaluated by assessing student
              competence in these solid-state physics topics both before and after the
              implementation of the changes. Once these labs have been developed and tested,
              they will be disseminated through publications in appropriate journals and
              through presentations at relevant conferences.
