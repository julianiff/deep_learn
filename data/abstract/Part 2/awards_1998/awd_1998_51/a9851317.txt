Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance the chemistry curricula through the use
              of interactive exercises on the World Wide Web.  The addition of networked
              computers complements the recent purchases of an FT-IR instrument (ILI-IP grant
              9551254), an FT-NMR instrument (ILI-IP grant 9551330), and a GC-MS instrument
              (ILI-IP grant 9751604) and is making significant contributions to chemistry
              education.  Incorporating the resources available on the internet, including
              tutorials on the theory and use of NMR Spectroscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy,
              Mass Spectrometry, and the study of Crystalline Solids, is enhancing our
              curriculum by reinforcing lecture topics, upgrading existing experiments, and
              allowing the introduction of new experiments. The students also engage in
              molecular modeling using the Spartan program and compare their results with
              their laboratory data. Additionally, greater access to computers on campus is
              allowing for more efficient use of the FT-NMR by creating additional
              opportunities for processing of data. The networked computers are a mix of
              network ready PCs and Macs.
