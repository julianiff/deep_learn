Abstract    :
                The scanning tunneling microscope is a device which can be used as an
              instructional tool at many different levels. In this proposal, a scanning
              tunneling microscope will be used in a wide range of courses and for
              undergraduate research in the Department of Chemistry and Physics at Radford
              University. Its use will not, however, be limited to majors in this department.
              The scanning tunneling microscope, and the images it produces, will be
              integrated into a service course for non-science majors as well. In this way,
              the scanning tunneling microscope will be used "across the curriculum."
