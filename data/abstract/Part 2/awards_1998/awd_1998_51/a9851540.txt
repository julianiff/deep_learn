Abstract    :
                This project proposes the development of a series of laboratory activities for
              use in a freshman biology course that focuses on cell and molecular- biology.
              These activities are improving students' understanding of cellular processes by
              giving students the opportunity to manipulate biochemical pathways operating in
              isolated organelles and to quantify the effects of this manipulation. In
              addition, the activities introduce students to tools and techniques commonly
              used in research, industrial, and medical laboratories.
