Abstract    :
              This project creates a cohesive, experiential Molecular and Cellular Biology
              Emphasis at the University. The course is integrated, investigative, and
              foundational in supporting and stimulating student research in the discipline.
              This project, and the resulting Molecular and Cellular Biology Emphasis,
              impacts lower and upper division majors and non-science majors. It exposes
              students early on in their education to fundamental tenets of science. Students
              mentoring other students create a cooperative learning environment that
              encourages the sharing of knowledge while reinforcing that knowledge.
