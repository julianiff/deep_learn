Abstract    :
                We propose a joint project between the departments of chemistry and physics.
              The project aims at improving the laser Instructional and Undergraduate
              Research Laboratories by: a. introducing the basics of laser spectroscopy into
              the physical chemistry curriculum, b. enhancing the course content of the
              current physics lasers course, and reinforcing interdisciplinary aspects of the
              chemistry and physics curricula. The project is an effort to expand the scope
              of the laser laboratory Southern Oregon University and improve the curricula of
              both departments by drawing upon existing faculty expertise and equipment. We
              will accomplish the following objectives: a. Provide hands-on experience with
              fundamental techniques of modern laser spectroscopy b. facilitate the transport
              of methodologies between courses in the two departments and minimize redundancy
              and duplication c. foster active student participation in learning, and expand
              the scope of, and potential for, research projects available to students. The
              success of our plan could provide a model for co-operative approach in
              comparable undergraduate institutions.
