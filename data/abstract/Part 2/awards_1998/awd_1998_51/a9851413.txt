Abstract    :
                Funds are requested for the purchase of equipment to establish a foundation of
              hands-on experience in molecular biology, in a biology majors curriculum that
              is strongly environmentally-oriented. The specific objectives are to (1) expand
              laboratory experiments in the introductory series for majors and in the core
              courses, Genetics and Cell Biology, to build students' understanding of
              molecular methods; (2) add exercises involving molecular methods to upper
              division courses that have been traditionally field- oriented, such as Ecology
              and Plant Systematics; (3) build on molecular foundations in Developmental
              Biology, Molecular Biology, and Biochemistry; and (4) provide students with the
              means to carry out meaningful research projects utilizing tools of molecular
              biology. Techniques of molecular biology are used in research in all
              disciplines of biology. Regardless of their areas of specialization, students
              will benefit from direct experience with such techniques to solve problems in a
              variety of courses. With access to appropriate equipment, students will learn
              how to apply molecular approaches to experimentation in diverse disciplines of
              biology. Our institution demonstrated its commitment to this project by
              designating special funds in 1995 for instrumentation, primarily for Genetics,
              Cell Biology, and Molecular Biology (offered for the first time that year). We
              aim to further integrate molecular biology across the biology curriculum.
