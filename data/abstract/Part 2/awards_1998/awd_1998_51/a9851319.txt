Abstract    :
                This project describes the incorporation of a requested ultracentrifuge into
              the Biology and Biochemistry programs at Loyola Marymount University. The
              ultracentrifuge will augment existing equipment and will be used to:  a)
              provide the basis for a new course in cellular biology affecting a significant
              number of biology and biochemistry majors, b) augment and integrate existing
              courses in molecular biology and biochemistry, and c) enhance the nvolvement of
              faculty and students in undergraduate research.    The acquisition of this
              equipment will strengthen the Biology and Chemistry and Biochemistry
              departmental programs by: 1) providing strong laboratory experiences in
              cellular biology, 2) complementing existing molecular biology and biochemistry
              facilities for an integrated approach to the study of cellular and subcellular
              phenomena, 3) enhancing undergraduate research opportunities by enabling
              biology and biochemistry faculty to pursue new avenues of research, and 4)
              reinforcing cross-departmental interaction and collaboration in teaching and
              research efforts.
