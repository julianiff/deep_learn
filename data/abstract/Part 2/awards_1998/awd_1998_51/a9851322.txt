Abstract    :
                Western Oregon University seeks the acquisition of a small-scale automated DNA
              sequencing apparatus with which to expand its curriculum in molecular biology
              for biology majors, undergraduate research, and secondary school science
              educators. The uses of this piece of equipment include the following: (1) DNA
              sequence analysis and computational biology will be incorporated into existing
              laboratory courses for microbiology and molecular biology; (2) special summer
              workshops and continuing education research experiences for secondary science
              teachers will be developed in molecular biology that employ recombinant DNA
              technology and DNA sequence analysis; (3) DNA sequence analysis is an integral
              part of the research in three laboratories which provide research experiences
              to undergraduates, honors students, and secondary science educators; and (4)
              data generated by DNA sequence analysis encourages students, both general
              laboratory participants and students participating in research, to utilize
              computer networks, thus connecting them with the larger framework of genome
              research, molecular databases, and the scientific community at large.
