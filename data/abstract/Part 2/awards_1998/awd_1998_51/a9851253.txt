Abstract    :
                The purpose of this project is to provide our students with laboratory
              experience in modern Fourier transform-based multinuclear 1H and 13C nuclear
              magnetic resonance applications. The selected instrument uses an existing 1.4
              Tesla permanent magnet augmented with FT probes shims and software to permit
              student operation with minimal training. This will allow students to begin to
              use the instrumentation early in a sophomore organic laboratory course.
              Chemistry majors and minors will continue to work with NMR applications in
              later analytical, physical, and advanced organic courses. They will become
              familiar not only with routine applications for simple structural
              identifications, but with advanced applications such as COSY,
              inversion/recovery measurements of T1, temperature-dependent exchange kinetics,
              and saturation transfer studies. Since this is not a high-field magnet system,
              the sensitivity and resolution will not match that of a typical superconducting
              NMR. In an educational setting, these disadvantages are offset by the fact that
              the proposed system is relatively easy to Maintain, the purchase and operating
              costs are much lower, and the versatility of the probe and software will still
              permit students to set up and run sophisticated range of experiments.
