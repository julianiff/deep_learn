Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics and Astronomy is upgrading the experimental physics
              experiences for upper level undergraduate physics majors. This project
              specifically involves the acquisition of equipment for improving an upper level
              laboratory courses taken by physics majors. This two semester course is
              entitled Experimental Physics I & II. Laboratory space is being renovated for
              teaching this course. Specific objectives of the modernization are as follows:
              (1) To learn experimental techniques and the use of modern instruments employed
              in physics research laboratories, (2) to develop an understanding of standard
              techniques of data reduction and error analysis commonly used by physicists;
              (3) to develop computer techniques that are useful for the acquisition and
              analysis of large quantities of data; (4) to learn proper techniques that are
              useful for designing experimental research projects; (5) to learn proper
              methods for presentation of scientific results; and (6) to independently
              design, conduct, analyze and present selected experiments in physics and (7) to
              experience the experimental basis of physics. It is expected that this
              modernization at Howard University will help similar steps at other HBCUs also.
               This project concentrates on E-M radiation, its interactions and uses. The
              experiments are, (a) Dielectric constant measurement at microwave frequencies,
              (ii) Hologram construction, (iii) Faraday effect, (iv) Optical spectroscopy,
              and (v) Compton effect.
