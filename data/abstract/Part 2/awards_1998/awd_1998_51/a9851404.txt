Abstract    :
              As the twenty-first century approaches, astronomy is enjoying a time of
              extraordinary advances that hold the potential to revolutionize our
              understanding of the physical universe. To offer students at Trinity University
              intensive hands-on experiences in astronomy during this remarkable period, we
              wish to acquire a set of modern telescopes and related equipment for the Marrs
              McLean Science Center, including a single computer-controlled, 16"
              Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, six computer-controlled, 8" Schmidt-Cassegrain
              telescopes, and two CCD cameras. This new equipment will be such a dramatic
              improvement over our present facilities that we will be able to implement a
              well-defined, two-tier approach to the teaching of observational astronomy
              "across the curriculum" - primarily in introductory physics laboratory courses
              and astronomy classes, but ranging from first-year seminar courses to our most
              advanced experimental physics courses for majors - that may serve as a useful
              model for similar undergraduate institutions. First, students will discover how
              much they can learn about the universe by their own human powers of observation
              and estimation at the eyepiece of a telescope. Second, they will obtain CCD
              images of celestial objects and make rigorous, quantitative, research-quality
              measurements. The relatively modest cost of this acquisition would make it as
              common for Trinity students to do astronomy with telescopes as it already is
              for them to do biology with microscopes. The principal beneficiaries will be
              approximately 250 Trinity undergraduates (>10% of total enrollment) per year,
              of whom 50% are women and 20% minoritv students.
