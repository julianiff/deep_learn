Abstract    :
                        This project will improve the laboratories of those undergraduate
              courses in Northeastern Illinois University' s Earth Science curriculum that
              address concepts in mineralogy, petrology, and high temperature geochemistry.
              The primary objective is to revise selected lab exercises and incorporate
              extended group projects that are constructivist in approach, making maximal use
              of our existing facilities. The acquisition of the rock-preparation equipment
              requested here will make it possible to implement exercises that will utilize
              our X-ray diffractometer, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, high temperature
              furnaces, and petrographic microscopes in a practical and efficient manner.
              With the changes outlined in this proposal, students will learn key mineralogic
              and petrologic concepts as they use a variety of analytical equipment to
              conduct their own experiments, gather their own data, and examine samples of
              their choosing.
