Abstract    :
              This project will establish a thermal analysis laboratory at Wellesley College.
              Such a laboratory is rarely available at the undergraduate level, and we hope
              to set up an exemplary one which will help to reinforce the usefulness of
              thermodynamics to a variety of chemical and biochemical problems. The
              laboratory, consisting of two microcalorimeters, (an isothermal titration
              calorimeter (ITC) and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)) will be used
              extensively in upper division undergraduate courses including physical
              chemistry, biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. In addition, the calorimeters
              will be used in our active student/faculty research efforts on thermodynamics
              properties of biological reactions, and structure of proteins, nanoparticles
              and crystals. Because Wellesley College is a women's college, this project will
              serve to enhance the education of women scientists and encourage them to pursue
              further scientific studies.
