Abstract    :
               The Department of Biology of Indiana University of Pennsylvania is implementing
              reforms to create a cohesive, student-centered natural sciences learning
              community; a new curriculum for Biology majors, stressing hands-on,
              experiential learning and providing progressively greater opportunities for
              semi-independent student research. Three components are being introduced into
              the Genetics course, a course required for students preparing to be biology
              teachers and the capstone course of the new curriculum: (1)  a distributive
              computing environment for the course to enable utilization of  genetic analysis
              programs available on the Internet; (2) a set of new experiments emphasizing
              modern molecular genetics and providing opportunities for discovery and for
              synthesis; and (3)  addition of  a required student research project to the
              laboratory segment of the course.  The equipment is also being used in Saturday
              workshops for in-service teachers and in a set of traveling workstations. 
              Preservice biology teachers are assisting with the workshops and are being
              given the opportunity to utilize the workstations during their student
              teaching.
