Abstract    :
              Whitman College's Department of Physics is upgrading its second year physics
              laboratories. In conjunction with recent revisions to the introductory
              laboratory and advanced laboratory, a series of seven intermediate-level
              experiments are being developed for the second-year that will continue the
              development of the student's experimental skills using appropriately more
              sophisticated data acquisition and analysis techniques.
