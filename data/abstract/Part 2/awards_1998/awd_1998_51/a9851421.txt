Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at James Madison University is developing a
              computer classroom/laboratory for Introductory Statistics. The facility will be
              used to improve the curriculum through the use of individual and group projects
              involving statistical experiments and data analysis, in-class use of WEB-based
              resources, and further development of James Madison University's Interactive
              Problem system, currently being implemented for WEB-based homework assignments
              in Introductory Statistics. Goals for the project include helping students
              construct a conceptual understanding of statistics, giving students a realistic
              picture of the role of statistics as an essential tool in their own discipline,
              introducing students to the computer as a primary tool in data analysis with
              skills which are easily transferable to courses in the students' disciplines,
              and helping the introductory statistics course become more effective in meeting
              the goals of mathematics-statistics general education.
