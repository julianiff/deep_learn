Abstract    :
              A primary area of growth in the communications industry is in equipment which
              operates in the lower microwave spectrum (cable TV, mobile telephone, pagers,
              GPS, etc.). The nation is experiencing growth in the communications industry,
              and although the present growth is primarily in sales and corporate management,
              production is also involved.   This project is establishing a RF and microwave
              instructional laboratory based on use of the RF network analyzer.  The
              laboratory is being used in existing courses in RF and digital communications,
              circuit fabrication, and  senior design courses, and in a much-needed course in
              microwave technology.
