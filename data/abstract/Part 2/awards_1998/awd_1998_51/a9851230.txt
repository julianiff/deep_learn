Abstract    :
                This project will set up a computational chemistry laboratory at Middle
              Tennessee State University with the goal of integrating computational chemistry
              and molecular modeling techniques with chemistry education from introductory
              chemistry up through undergraduate research. We will expose majors to
              computational chemistry early, so that they can have access to the lab
              throughout all of their undergraduate years. Our aim is to cultivate student
              initiative, so that, by their senior year, students are accustomed to applying
              computational techniques to upper level courses (and undergraduate research).
              We will develop a course in computational chemistry specifically designed for
              those students who choose that particular emphasis in their education.
