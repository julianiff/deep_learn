Abstract    :
              This project establishes a computational chemistry facility with six
              Pentium-based workstations and several commercial software packages. The
              facility supports the integration of computer simulations and visualization
              into our undergraduate chemistry curriculum through a variety of chemistry
              applications and research projects that are accessible to undergraduates.
              Students first encounter calculations in their sophomore-level organic and
              junior-level physical chemistry laboratories. The exercises complement the
              experiments performed in the laboratory and introduce students to graphical
              user interfaces and standard computational techniques such as geometry
              optimization and conformational searching.  A comprehensive course in
              computational chemistry is also being developed for advanced undergraduates.
              This course presents a fairly detailed discussion of molecular mechanics and
              electronic structure methods including their applications and limitations.
              Finally, the facility supports the computational research projects of our
              undergraduate students. By coupling experiment and computation, students gain
              greater insight into molecular structure, properties, and reactivity than can
              be obtained from experiment alone.
