Abstract    :
                The Chemistry Department at the University of South Alabama is currently
              focusing on modernizing our upper level laboratory courses such that the
              experiments are more consistent with ongoing chemistry research. A primary
              consideration in this effort is the study of biological molecules and systems.
              We plan to use a computer interfaced potentiostat to introduce four new
              experiments that emphasize biological molecules or applications. The equipment
              will have a major impact upon the Instrumental Analysis, Inorganic Chemistry,
              and Physical Chemistry laboratories. There are relatively few electrochemistry
              experiments in our current laboratory curriculum and none that use modern
              methods to examine biological molecules. The potentiostat will be used to
              introduce upper level students to techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, pulse
              voltammetry, and spectroelectrochemistry by characterizing molecules such as
              epinephrine (adrenaline), amino acid complexes of copper, acetaminophen, and
              myoglobin. These electrochemistry experiments will interest and motivate
              students, as well as complement our established spectroscopy experiments.
