Abstract    :
              We propose to replace more than half of current Introductory Biology laboratory
              exercises with four new discovery-based laboratories that will explicitly
              require students to formulate and test hypotheses in the context of combining
              modern molecular techniques with traditional organismal biology. In our new
              Molecular Population Genetics, Plant Chemical Defense, Morphological and
              Molecular Phylogeny, and Bioacoustic Behavior laboratories students will
              formulate their own hypotheses and then test those hypotheses using
              electrophoresis, High Performance Liquid Chromatography and computer
              simulations. Together, these exercises will help establish a research culture
              in Introductory Biology by requiring all undergraduate majors to develop the
              skills of hypothesis formation, experimental design, and statistical analysis
              and interpretation to test relevant ecological and evolutionary questions using
              modern molecular techniques.
