Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a FT-NMR spectrometer to augment the quality of our
              undergraduate curriculum is at the top of our agenda for the following
              important reasons: (i) The department is planning to revise all of its
              laboratory curriculum (organic, inorganic, analytical and physical) to include
              experiments with added emphasis on hands-on experience for our students, (ii)
              The organic chemistry laboratory course has recently been modified with all of
              its new experiments carried out on a small scale and this revision is in
              preparation for our anticipated change to a microscale curriculum, (iii) A new
              course emphasizing the use of a modern NMR for molecular structure elucidation
              is under preparation and will be offered to our advanced undergraduates and
              graduate students, (iv) Undergraduates involved in faculty-supervised research
              during the academic year and in the summer will also be benefited greatly from
              the availability of a high field NMR spectrometer. We have identified
              MercuryTM, a Varian spectrometer, as ideally suited to our pedagogical needs.
              Approximately 100 students per semester will have (carefully monitored)
              hands-on access to the instrument. The PIs have considerable experience in NMR
              spectroscopy and can fully utilize all the capabilities of the machine to
              implement the desired changes in the curriculum.
