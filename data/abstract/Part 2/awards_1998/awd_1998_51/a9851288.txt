Abstract    :
                  The Engineering Science Department at MCC has a two stage plan for providing
              students with  improved modeling and design experiences. In the first stage,
              the Engineering Science  department will more fully integrate modeling and
              design in both the engineering circuits and  mathematics courses in the
              program. The second stage will incorporate the use of 3D solid  modeling in our
              engineering graphics class along with a design and build project which will 
              involve a student team consisting of both Engineering Science and Tooling and
              Machining  students.  Implementation of both stages of this plan requires the
              addition of 14 computers, Mathematical  and AutoCAD software, and a later
              printer to our Engineering Science laboratory. This  equipment would be
              installed in the summer of 1998 and would be ready for use in the fall of 
              1998. The first stage will begin with the integration of the curricula of
              Calculus 3 (MTH 212)  with Introductory Circuits (ENR 253) in the fall of 1998.
              Mathematical software will be used in  the Circuits (ENR 254) laboratory to
              model analog circuits. Math and Engineering faculty will  work closely so that
              the examples used in Calculus are relevant to circuit modeling and analysis. 
              During the Spring of 1999, a similar approach will be used with Differential
              Equations (MTH  225) and Circuits (ENR 254).  In the fall of 1999, the second
              stage will begin with the use of 3D solid modeling with AutoCad in  the
              engineering graphics class (ENR 153). In addition to creating computer models
              of  mechanical assemblies, students will also work in teams with students from
              the MCC Tooling and  Machining department to complete a design and build
              project.
