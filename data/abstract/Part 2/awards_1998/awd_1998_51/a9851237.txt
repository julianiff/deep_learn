Abstract    :
              This project is designed to provide prospective elementary and middle school
              teachers the opportunity to develop and utilize their own imagery and spatial
              sense.   In particular, Towson University Mathematics Department is revising
              the way it teaches geometry to prospective elementary and middle school
              teachers by infusing computing technologies in their mathematics content
              courses. The objective of the project is to establish a computer classroom to
              be used in this innovative geometry course for prospective teachers.    
              Sixteen desktop computers with appropriate geometry software will be installed
              in a classroom. These computers will also be connected to the Internet so that
              the existing electronic materials may be fully utilized, including web-based
              materials we are developing. Additional laptop computers will allow instructor
              demonstration and students' sharing of their ideas in regular classrooms.    
              Data will be collected to identify how and how often computing technologies are
              utilized in the geometry course. Course activities generated by our instructors
              will be available to other instructors at Towson and other institutions.
