Abstract    :
                Through the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Laboratory, Trident Technical
              College will implement the use of high technology surveying equipment into a
              total of three civil engineering technology and civil engineering transfer
              program survey courses and labs. Implementation of this project will allow
              Trident to address three curriculum deficiencies: (1 ) Trident is unable to
              teach GPS surveying techniques to train surveyors to comply with recent South
              Carolina legislation mandates; (2) surveying students are often underprepared
              for employment because of the lack of GPS training; and (3) the existing
              equipment limits course content in surveying courses.  Introduction to GPS
              survey equipment is necessary for the education of students entering the civil
              engineering technology field since the two-year technical colleges are the main
              source of education and degrees which qualify students to become licensed land
              surveyors.  Through this project Trident Technical College will: revise
              curriculum in 3 existing civil engineering technology and civil engineering
              transfer courses to include the use of GPS surveying and mapping equipment;
              develop laboratory exercises that allow students to develop technical skills in
              utilizing GPS equipment and surveying software that prepares them for state
              mandated changes in surveying procedures; work with other technical colleges in
              the state to provide a flexible training program for students throughout the
              state interested in becoming registered land surveyors; and expand the
              introduction to surveying classes to the high school level including GPS and
              conventional surveying technology.
