Abstract    :
               The Lakeland Community College Bioscience Technology Program, developed in
              response to the growing demand for bioscience technicians in the region, is the
              only associate degree biotechnology program in northern Ohio. The program is
              being developed in a joint effort by scientists in the biotechnology industry,
              and researcher/educators in academic institutions. The curriculum provides
              students with the fundamental scientific knowledge and practical experience
              necessary to function as competent bioscience technicians.   The laboratory
              improvement project impacts bioscience majors, science majors and non-majors,
              as well as health science students.  It achieves the following: 1. Provides
              state-of-the-art equipment to train and retrain bioscience technicians; 2.
              Establishes a summer institute for college and high school faculty; 3. Effects
              systemic changes in high school and college science curricula; 4. Conducts
              biotechnology workshops for high school students; and 5. Develops a
              Biotechnology Tech Prep Program.  Programs and laboratory exercises developed
              within this project are being made available to the scientific community
              through internet access and public discussion.
