Abstract    :
                At GMI, three conditions reduce the effectiveness of how we deliver the
              engineering design process, especially in capstone design courses: 1)
              fragmented approach to teaching design 2)short quarter system (11 weeks of
              instruction), and 3) alternating work and study terms required by, and
              essential to GMI's cooperative education program.  Like GMI, many institutions
              of higher learning teach various steps of a typical design cycle from problem
              identification to functional prototype. This teaching process is often loosely
              supervised by faculty due to physical dispersion of resources and also
              traditional classroom environments. As a result, students do not learn the
              design process as an "holistic" and interdisciplinary activity. Additionally,
              institutions which face GMI's challenge of short access to students rarely have
              enough time to carry out the design process beyond a "paper" concept.  It is
              proposed to set up a design environment called "Total Design Studio" which
              brings all necessary tools for conducting a complete design cycle under one
              roof. Unlike traditional classroom settings, the layout of the studio is
              carefully manipulated to be conducive to creative design activities. A few key
              technologies are requested via this proposal. These are coupled with a
              curriculum change that can serve as a role model for schools faced with similar
              time restrictions as GMI. Five capstone design courses, collectively taken by
              more than 60% of GMI's engineering students, will be spread over three terms
              one of which is an off-site work term. This will require integration of
              internet and multi-media tools into these courses.  To date, we have spent
              about $60,000 to prepare the physical environment for the Design Studio. Also,
              three industrial contributors have offered $80,000 (cash and gifts in kind) as
              further support. We will inform the educational community as to the impact of
              the requested technologies and the proposed curriculum changes on our
              effectiveness in teaching engineering design.
