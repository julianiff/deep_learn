Abstract    :
                Students are using digital cameras, analog to digital conversion boards,
              software and computers to make labs in the optics program more quantitative and
              true-to-life. The cameras are used to study optical aberrations, diffraction,
              and interference patterns. The A/D boards are used to capture signals from
              scanning interferometers. Software includes general purpose optical design and
              image analysis software. The computers are used to acquire and analyze data
              from experiments and to introduce students to simulations of optical concepts.
