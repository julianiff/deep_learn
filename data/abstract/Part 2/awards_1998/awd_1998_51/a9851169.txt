Abstract    :
                The major objective of this project is to provide students at Cottey College,
              a two-year college for women, access to the type of research experience
              typically available to students at four-year institutions. Second-semester
              organic chemistry laboratory will focus on a research project, with the entire
              class acting as the research group, and the laboratory instructor acting as the
              research director. Students will be asked to contribute to the overall
              direction of a group project. It is intended that during the course of the
              semester, students will develop a greater understanding of the mechanism of
              research in the natural sciences, and that each student will come to a greater
              realization of her own level of interest in scientific research.  The
              laboratory program that will be implemented is designed to benefit chemistry
              students at Cottey College, as well as students at other junior colleges and
              small women's colleges. It is believed that this program could benefit any
              department that offers organic chemistry to a small (10 to 15) number of
              students, or a large department offering an independent section of organic
              chemistry laboratory for its chemistry majors. This program is not designed to
              address the needs of large, multi-section organic chemistry laboratories.
