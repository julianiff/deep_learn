Abstract    :
              The NMR upgrade provides chemistry students access to current NMR
              instrumentation early in their academic careers and permits them to use more
              sophisticated 1D- and 2D-NMR in upper division courses.  Students obtain hands
              on experience with NMR in introductory organic laboratories.  The instrument
              also supports laboratories in physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and
              advanced synthesis courses.  Faculty from two neighboring institutions are
              cooperating with the PI to provide students spectra of their samples through
              remote access to the upgraded instrument facilities.
