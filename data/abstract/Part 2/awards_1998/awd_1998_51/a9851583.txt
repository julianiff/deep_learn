Abstract    :
                Students who complete an undergraduate computing degree still must learn too
              many new tasks and concepts when they join a company that uses modern software
              engineering practices. We will establish a laboratory to support team projects
              for two undergraduate software engineering courses for computer science and
              engineering majors. Exercises and projects based on the lab's software and
              hardware will allow students to experience development activities that are
              closer to a realistic industrial experience in these areas:  a defined standard
              software development process, complete with policies, document standards, and
              reviews; the use of modern development tools, including configuration
              management and defect tracking tools to help in managing team projects.  For
              our laboratory we will also develop a set of exercises and small projects in
              other areas of software engineering that will benefit our students and students
              at other universities. Areas addressed will include rapid prototyping, software
              testing, formal methods, and process improvement. To establish this laboratory,
              personal computers, software development tools and other CASE tools are needed.
              To aid in dissemination of our results, we will make use of software that is
              commonly available and relatively inexpensive (or free) for universities,
              including components of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Visual Studio.
