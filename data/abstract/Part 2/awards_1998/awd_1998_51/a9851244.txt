Abstract    :
               For years courses have been offered to introduce the liberal arts and business
              students to the use of computers as a tool to aid them in their education and
              professions. Unfortunately this has not been done for students in science. It
              has been assumed that they will learn by osmosis or just pick up skills as
              needed. We believe that science students should be introduced to the
              capabilities of computers in their freshman year as a tool to assist them in
              their learning and in their life's work. Topics to be covered in such a course
              include not only the usual usage of word processing, spreadsheets, and simple
              data bases, but more importantly, will concentrate on how to use the computer
              to search, analyze, evaluate and display scientific data. In addition these
              students need instruction in downloading and analyzing large masses of data,
              automating the collection of data, using statistical packages to analyze data,
              graphing the results of data, using modeling and simulation techniques, and
              preparing materials for presentation.   We propose to develop a course for
              beginning science and mathematics students to provide them with the necessary
              skills in computing to use a wide variety of computing tools to assist them in
              their education and prepare them to use computers as an effective tool in their
              career in a scientific setting.
