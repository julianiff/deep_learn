Abstract    :
              Catonsville Community College, a local leader in post-secondary education as
              well as career preparation, has recently learned from our professional
              scientific advisory boards that a number of skill deficiencies are becoming
              increasingly problematic for students entering the workplace. These
              deficiencies include: (1) lack or familiarity with current technology and
              instrumentation appropriate to the worksite; (2) lack of ability to apply
              concepts learned in one situation to solve problems in others; (3) lack of
              confidence in handling, evaluating, manipulating, and reporting large pools of
              data, (4) lack of confidence and skill in troubleshooting and problem solving
              (5) lack of creativity; and (6) lack of ability to communicate with others,
              especially with individuals from related but different work areas. An
              Interdisciplinary Review Committee consisting of faculty from various science
              and mathematics disciplines determined that significant reform in introductory
              majors and non-majors laboratory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental
              Science and Mathematics would have significant and positive impact on student
              readiness for transition to work or advanced post-secondary education. This
              project will establish a model for integrated, multi-disciplinary science
              education built upon a firm foundation in mathematic competency and the use of
              technologically-appropriate instrumentation. Our objectives are to develop and
              implement two expanded multi-disciplinary laboratory exercises for each of two
              introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and
              Mathematics which are student-driven and inquiry-based; equip four portable
              laboratories each with five Lab Works II Computer Interfaces, lap-top
              computers, sensors, and graphing calculators for use in laboratory exercises;
              and build pertinent mathematical computations and applications into all
              laboratory activities.
