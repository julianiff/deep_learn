Abstract    :
              9861095
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              explores a liquid crystal (LC) etalon design that capitalizes on  solid state
              Fabry Perot etalons, which are tunable by altering an applied potential.  Phase
              I will construct prototype systems that use the precision tuning capability of
              a number of smaller LC  etalons to produce a mosaic that, when tuned, will act
              as a single etalon of larger aperture.  The mosaic etalons can be produced with
              diameters far exceeding those of traditional monolithic etalons, and can retain
              the ease of use inherent in LC etalons.  It is thought that the LC technique,
              that is the centerpiece of the instrument, will become an essential component
              of future spectroscopy.
     Commercial applications are expected in remote
              sensing of regulated environmental pollutants, replacement of current large
              aperture interference filters for spectral imaging applications, measurements
              utilizing spectroscopic remote sensing or process spectroscopy, and passive
              detection of clear air turbulence.
