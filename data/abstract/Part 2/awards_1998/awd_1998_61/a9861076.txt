Abstract    :
              9861076
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project  will
              develop diffractive optical elements (DOEs) based on photodynamic azobenzene
              functionalized polymeric materials.  DOEs with surface relief structures are
              playing an important role in the rapidly emerging photonic technologies.  This
              Phase I project will focus upon the direct photofabrication of DOEs on
              photodynamic azopolymers, and experiments on the recording and testing of the
              surface relief DOEs will be carried out.  If successful, this elegant, simple
              processing of materials into optical elements with surface relief structure
              will lead to DOEs that are inexpensive, versatile and flexible.
