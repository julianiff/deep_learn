Abstract    :
              9861236 
	Hearing loss obstructs the learning of numerical concepts,
              quantitative reasoning, problem solving and the enjoyment of mathematics.  This
              Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Learning in Motion,
              Inc. is a feasibility study focusing on modifying existing multimedia into
              instructional tools for PreK-K children with significant hearing loss.  The
              need is critical: Two out of every 1,000 young children in the United States
              have hearing loss severe enough to adversely affect learning.  The National
              Action Plan for Mathematics Education Reform for the Deaf (1995) recommends
              that more resources address mathematics instruction for children with
              significant hearing loss.  Learning in Motion has published a research-based,
              field-tested, multi-media program for early learners of mathematics.  The
              multi-media includes three-dimensional graphics and characters, completed game
              logic, and eleven interactive game activities.  The main objectives of this
              project are as follows:  document the experiences of hearing-impaired students
              as they use the existing program; from this information, take one game activity
              and modify it to accommodate the special needs of children with significant
              hearing loss, and initiate a testing plan for the modified segment.  Should
              feasibility indicate continued modification, salable multimedia for these
              students and design guidelines will ultimately be produced.
          The
              proposed activity will serve to broaden the participation of underrepresented
              groups in mathematics activities and learning.  What is proposed although
              focused on benefiting students with hearing loss may also serve as a model to
              support students with other types of disabilities.  The project has the
              potential to produce a completely modified mathematics multimedia program for
              children with significant hearing loss.  Design of guidelines for others
              electing to develop specialized software would also be produced, thus setting
              the stage for and encouraging commercial collaboration with publishers looking
              to create or convert other multimedia titles.
