Abstract    :
              9861021
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Virtual Ink Corporation extends the scope of the firm's handwriting
              transcription technology from its primary use on large collaborative
              whiteboards found in conference and meeting rooms to educational distance
              learning and video conferencing applications such as chalkboards and
              flipcharts.  Virtual Ink has successfully demonstrated a retrofit digital
              transcription system to capture handwritten text and sketches off of a
              dry-erase marker board up to 8' x 4' in size.  Transcriptions are done in color
              and real-time uploading the resulting information to a personal computer, where
              it can be stored, sharing via the World Wide Web, or exported to a variety of
              electronic and digital document formats.  This project will investigate issues
              specific to the educational, distance learning, and video conferencing
              infrastructures and yield concrete research to support critical product design
              directions and embodiments to be subsequently pursued.
     An affordable
              technology to convert any flat surface into a high-resolution, freestyle
              handwriting capture medium (such as whiteboard, chalkboard, flipchart, drafting
              table, or desktop) in order to view, share, store, or export data to a variety
              of digital and electronic document formats would permit business professionals,
              scientists, engineers, architects, designs and others to have useful and
              creative meetings without having to leave the office.  This technology allows
              remote brainstorming to become a practical reality.  With the increase of
              professional telecommuting from home, the ability to creatively brainstorm and
              solve problems with others remotely will have a significant impact on personal
              and professional productivity.
