Abstract    :
              9861436
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project
              will address the development of probe technology to speciate toxic algae.  
              Algal toxins can cause mass mortality of wild and farmed fish, contaminate
              shellfish beds, and cause human illnesses from consumption of these products. 
              Once established, harmful algal blooms typically are monospecific.  The
              bio-optical "fingerprint" of the bloom, related to the specific pigment
              composition and ratios, is distinct to that species.  This lends itself to
              pigment based analysis techniques for bloom onset identification, tracking, and
              resource protection.  Phase I will investigate a novel probe for in situ
              monitoring photosynthetic pigments in aquatic systems, utilizing a simultaneous
              narrow band Reflectance/Absorption/Fluorometric (RAF) sensor for determination
              of pigment composition and species identification (specifically red tide
              algae).
     Commercial applications are expected in substantial markets for
              scientific instrumentation.  Estimated annual government and private sector
              expenditures on pigment analysis are projected to be $23 million.  Expenditures
              associated with collection and processing are estimated at $224 million.
