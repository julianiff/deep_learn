Abstract    :
              9861127
	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  project from RSK
              Assessments, Inc. will develop a computerized battery to assess effects on
              workers of different stressor environments, including toxic ones, on human
              performance and human well being.  One limitation of current test batteries has
              been that different results may be obtained on the same test battery when it is
              implemented on different hardware.  One of the goals of the current proposal is
              to eliminate such variability across different interfaces.  The project will
              need to develop newer software systems (e.g., Windows), with tests implemented
              on several modern systems (desk top, lap top, palm top, etc.) which will permit
              satisfactory answers regarding psychological comparability (factor structure,
              means and standard deviations, etc.) of tests on different systems.  Building
              on RSK Assessments' cognitive battery which is reliable, stable and sensitive
              to various agents, the firm will broaden that battery to include visual and
              psychomotor tests and program it in a modern language in order to permit easy
              translation from raw data to analysis.  The Phase I research entails
              reprogramming these batteries, administering them to a large sample under
              graded dosages of alcohol in order to evaluate sensitivity and other metrics,
              and examining equipment differences.
	This project proffers a sensitive,
              marketable computerized assessment battery which samples multiple cognitive
              domains and that has wide value for the military and commercial communities in
              which the monitoring of human performance capabilities is important.
