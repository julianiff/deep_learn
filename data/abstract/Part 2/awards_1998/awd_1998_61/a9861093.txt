Abstract    :
              9861093
     A revolution in drug discovery is unfolding in the form of high
              throughput organic synthesis by parallel and combinatorial methods. Methods of
              conducting rapid screening for biological activity are keeping pace with the
              rapid growth of combinatorial libraries. The current limitation in fully
              characterizing these libraries is in the chemical analysis of purity and
              component composition. The currently accepted standard for high throughput
              analysis is liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). With a cycle time
              of about 5 minutes, an LC/MS instrument can analyze about 300 samples in a
              24-hour period. We propose an innovative MS concept that reduces cycle time to
              about 5 seconds, thus raising the potential analysis rate to greater than
              10,000 samples/day. The innovation is based on a novel ionization source that
              (1) ionizes nearly all drug candidates efficiently, (2) leads to nearly pure
              parent molecular ion for definitive analysis of complex mixtures, and (3) is
              immune to detection of common air constituents and many commonly used solvents.
              Our market research indicates the potential for exponential growth on the basis
              of quick penetration of the chemical analysis niche of the rapidly growing
              field of combinatorial and parallel synthesis methods for drug discovery.
    
              The proposed high throughput chemical analysis system has the potential to
              dominate the market for combinatorial library analysis, which is a rapidly
              growing field of drug discovery. Our real-time, complex mixture analyzers will
              also be marketed for applications in drug testing, environmental monitoring,
              and on-line process monitoring.
