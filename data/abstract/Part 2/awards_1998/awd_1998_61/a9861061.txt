Abstract    :
              9861061
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project by Sensor
              R&D will develop a semiconducting metal oxide film-based sensor array system,
              which will measure trimethyl amine and dimethyl amine gases, which directly
              correlate with marine fish freshness quality.  This technology provides a
              portable, fast and inexpensive means of accurately measuring emitted gas. 
              Advanced signal processing will be integrated with the sensor array.  At the
              conclusion of the Phase I activity, Sensor R&D will demonstrate a simultaneous
              measure of the concentration of both gases in a laboratory simulation of
              degrading fish.
