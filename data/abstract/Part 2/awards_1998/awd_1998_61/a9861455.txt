Abstract    :
              9861455
       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              aims to develop a scanning probe microwave microscope with sub-n-ficrometer
              spatial resolution for semiconductor characterization in the frequency range of
              100 MHz to 50 GHz. The proposed instrument is based on an existing
              low-resolution scanning microwave microscope (SMM) with a demonstrated
              capability of providing quantitative data. The primary focus of the proposed
              approach is to preserve this quantitative aspect of the instrument while
              improving spatial resolution. It thus presents an alternative to techniques
              based on scanning tunneling or scanning force microscopes.  The microscope
              consists of a resonant coaxial cable coupled to a microwave generator on one
              end and to the sample through an open-ended coaxial probe on the other end. The
              sample's pen-nittivity and conductivity result in a measurable shift of the
              coaxial cable's resonant frequency and Q-factor.  Sub-micron spatial resolution
              in a non-contact mode will be achieved by controlling the probe-to-sample
              separation using a piezo-driver, imaging in a constant frequency shift or
              constant Q-factor mode, and using an STM tip as the center conductor of the
              coaxial probe.  
     The long-term goal of this research is to provide a
              prototype scanning microwave microscope with improved spatial resolution and
              proven performance in quantitative semiconductor characterization at microwave
              frequencies. The multitude of potential applications of such an instrument make
              it an excellent candidate for commercialization.
