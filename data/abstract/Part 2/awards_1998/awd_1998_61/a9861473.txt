Abstract    :
              9861473
      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
              aims to develop a novel design of an all solid electro-chromic device based on
              a novel inorganic/ organic polyoxometalate polymer. The new design is composed
              of four layers, two transparent conductor layers (TC), an anode LiCoO2 EC
              layer, and a cathode inorganic/ organic polyoxometalate polymer EC layer. The
              advantage of this complementary design is that the electrodes are balanced and
              the color efficiency is enhanced. Electro-chromic (EC) materials have been
              studied extensively in recent years for their potential applications in display
              devices and in automotive and architectural glazings. These materials exhibit
              reversible and continuous change in their optical properties under electrically
              driven oxidation/reduction processes. As a result, light absorption,
              transmission, or reflection of EC materials can be controlled by an applied
              electric field.
       Among all the potential applications, "smart windows"
              for efficient use of energy in buildings have drawn the most attention from
              researchers around the world. Smart windows represent a huge market and
              remarkable opportunity to save energy without sacrificing  comfort. Other
              potential applications include 
display devices, automotive and architectural
              glazings, smart windows,  and EC glasses.
