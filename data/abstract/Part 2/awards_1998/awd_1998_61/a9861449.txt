Abstract    :
              9861449
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              research an innovative concept for joining composite materials and structures. 
              Current composites technology is heavily burdened by the logic and the design
              methods which have proven so successful for metals.  Indeed the structural
              layout of reduced mass materials and the assembly techniques remain remarkably
              similar to the established "lightweight design methods" for metallic
              structures. The method to be examined in this project has two important
              building blocks.  The first one is to increase the bearing strength of
              laminated composites by placing fibers perpendicular to the plane of
              lamination.  The second building block is to take advantage of the capacity of
              composites for high strain (as compared to metals). The firm has integrated
              both building blocks into an innovative "snap joint" concept which not only
              allows for quick assembly but is also capable of diffusing primary loads into
              structural elements.  A first type of "snap" joint has recently been
              demonstrated which appears to be  a superior method for joining polymer matrix
              composite materials.
     The "snap" joining methodology has extreme
              commercial appeal.  It will bring to the field of lightweight structures the
              same breakthroughs as "snap" joining did for plastics. If successful, the
              project could lead to a five-fold reduction in assembly times due to the
              virtual elimination of fasteners.
