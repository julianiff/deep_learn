Abstract    :
              9861111
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on
              reducing the minimum feature size that can be written lithographically to
              integrated circuits (chips!). Critical dimensions below 0.1 um require
              improved-precision interferometry to measure the position of the stage that
              holds the wafer. Although the stability of current laser gauges can be improved
              to attain a precision of less than 1 nm in constant-density air, these gauges
              cannot correct for air-density variations (turbulence). As a result, turbulence
              presently limits overlay precision to 20-30 nm. This  imprecision is
              unacceptably large for 0.1 um design-rule lithography, for which scaling
              estimates show that the stage-position measurement should contribute no more
              than ~2.5 nm to the overlay error budget. We propose to  develop a two-color
              stand-alone laser gauge that measures both the turbulence correction and the
              absolute stage  position simultaneously. A major advantage is that one of the
              colors can be the He-Ne 633-nm line, which is used in  nearly all current
              commercial laser gauges. This research will lead to a low-cost ( ~$60,000),
              ultra-compact  instrument that will decrease the contribution of the laser
              gauge to the overlay error to 2 nm. Phase I will prove the feasibility of the
              two-color technique, and Phase II will be a proof-of-principle demonstration.

                  Since the elimination of turbulence effects on laser-gauge precision will
              become progressively more critical as the required resolution with which
              steppers must overlay successive lithographic wafer exposures improves,
              commercial demand for the proposed instrument by stepper manufacturers is
              certain to be strong, with an anticipated market of $60 million by the year
              2004. The proposed instrument will then facilitate the development of steppers
              with sub-0.1 um minimum feature sizes and improve their resolution.
