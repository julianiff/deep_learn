Abstract    :
              9861308
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop and pilot test low cost educational modules for teaching science in
              several elementary grades Q through 6). Very recent advances in the photonics
              industry have produced a variety of miniature light sources called
              lightemitting diodes (LEDs) that cover the visible spectrum (red, green, blue).
              We will develop small, hand held light sources based on these devices and we
              will also develop miniature light detectors. These kits will include the
              necessary hardware as well as extensive curriculum materials for teachers and
              students. Specific science experiments will include: reflection, refraction,
              color theory, scattering, and fluorescence. Technology applications will
              include: simple models of bar code readers, CD players, and communication by
              light. Working closely with a curriculum director and teachers, we will
              integrate the kits into an existing science curriculum at several elementary
              and middle schools, and extensive pilot testing will be completed.
     There
              is considerable commercial potential for the low cost, versatile kits that we
              propose. Kits that offer exciting and inquiry based classroom experiments to
              elementary and middle school students could be widely accepted if the selling
              price is low. Our units will be centered around very low cost devices, yet will
              be effective and reliable.
