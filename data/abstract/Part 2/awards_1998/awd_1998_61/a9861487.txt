Abstract    :
              9861487
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves a
              parametric study of a "Self Sensing Active Control Foil Bearing" (SSACFB)
              concept.  Through the use of stacks of piezoelectric ceramic elements (PZT)
              attached along the foil element, the load applied onto the foil element can be
              determined using the voltage generated by the piezoelectric elements.  At the
              same time, the piezoelectric stacks also act as an actuator to push / pull the
              foil element towards/from the shaft to increase the loading capacity of the
              bearing and/or to ensure foil lift off at low shaft rotating speed.  The foil
              element instrumented with PZT piezoelectric ceramics becomes in effect a smart
              structure that can be continuously controlled in order to optimize system
              performance during rapid, intense transients.  The novelty of this concept
              resides in the introduction of a "smart bearing", which has the sensing and
              actuating system integrated into one single unit.  The other innovations to the
              application are an elastic bed and diamond like coating of the foil element. 
              The active control of the bearing will provide long life, lower power loss, and
              operational regime tuned loading capacity.  Phase I of the project will
              concentrate on the parametric study of the piezoelectric application on a foil
              element demonstrate the feasibility of the concept.
     According to Frost
              and Sullivan, the bearing market is growing at about 11 % a year and is
              forecast to see moderate growth in several areas in the future.  In the year
              2000, the total bearing market revenue is expected to reach $1.45 billion.  The
              successful development of the self sensing active control foil bearing will
              have great impact on high speed bearing applications, especially in the high
              speed precision manufacturing industries as well as in the aerospace
              industry.
