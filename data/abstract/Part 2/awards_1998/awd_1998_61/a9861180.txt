Abstract    :
              9861180
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore an application of complex chatter theory to operator control of
              high-speed machining processes.  The approach will be numerical control (NC)
              program verification software that alerts machinists to vibration problems that
              might occur using the speeds and feeds they have selected and to recommend
              alternate, optimized speeds.  Phase I will:  [1] Evaluate and bound the errors
              of existing chatter theory in the context of a "tool tuning" methodology for
              high-speed milling;  [2] Confirm theoretical results at a state-of-the-art
              high-speed milling facility by  measuring and characterizing vibrations
              accurately;  and [3] Consolidate these results within an NC program
              verification software package that provides (a) recommended optimal spindle
              speeds, based on the theoretical stability lobes predicted for an associated
              tool, (b) a simple means to convey to a machinist where on the part and in the
              part program serious chatter is likely to arise, and (c) a means for users to
              amend parameters based on experience .
     High-speed mill operators are not
              likely realizing the full advantage of their mill performance capabilities,
              relying instead on  conservative shop practice, which is based on conventional
              mills and a chatter avoidance strategy.  This software is expected to guide
              shop floor personnel through an optimal chatter-free speed and feed selection
              process, and though based on complex theory, it will use terms familiar to
              them.
