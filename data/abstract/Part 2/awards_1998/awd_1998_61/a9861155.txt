Abstract    :
              9861155
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate plasma enhanced vapor-liquid-solid (PE-VLS) growth of carbon
              nanotubes.  The resulting low cost, low temperature process will enable
              commercial applications of high quality carbon nanotubes grown on large area
              substrates.  Since the discovery of nanotubes in 1991, breakthrough
              applications have been anticipated in structural, electronic, electrochemical,
              catalytic, and sensing materials technology.  Unfortunately, existing
              laboratory synthesis and processing techniques are inappropriate for nanotube
              commercialization.  However, the understanding gained from these laboratory
              techniques does indicate a new path to commercially attractive synthesis.  This
              novel, PE-VLS process combines and develops two cost-effective materials
              processing technologies: VLS growth, and non-equilibrium, volume, plasma
              processing.  This Phase I project will first demonstrate uniform substrate
              coverage of nanometer catalyst dispersions.  Second, high temperature VLS
              growth will demonstrate catalyst effectiveness for nanotube synthesis.  Third,
              nanotube adherence to the substrate will be evaluated.  Finally, plasma
              enhancement will demonstrate the quality increase and bulk temperature decrease
              obtainable with PE-VLS.
     Potential commercial applications for the PE-VLS
              process include electrochemical electrodes, flat panel displays, surface
              modification, composite structures, catalysis, sensors and ultrafiltration. 
              With our industrial partner, we will examine applications in low energy
              separation, fuel cells, and internal combustion engines.
