Abstract    :
              9861504
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will begin
              development
of a phase sensitive spectroscopic technique that may be up to
              three orders of magnitude
more sensitive than FM spectroscopy. The proposed
              technique utilizes index of refraction
variations associated with a molecular
              resonance to generate a phase shift between two
optical beams. The sensitivity
              is greatly increased by utilizing matched grating, pairs to
amplify the phase
              shift. The proposed research will pursue an increased
              theoretical
understanding of the technique's capabilities and preliminary
              experiments will be
performed. This research will help determine the utility
              of this technique, define the
limiting parameters of the approach, and design
              a prototype instrument.
     Due to the high sensitivities expected from this
              technique, instruments based on
the proposed technology will be well suited
              for trace gas detection. Another application
of this technique is to utilize
              it for all-optical line locking of a laser to a molecular
resonance. This
              locking technique promises to be relatively simple and reliable, which
will be
              important for a variety of spectrally sensitive applications, including fiber
              optic
communications.
