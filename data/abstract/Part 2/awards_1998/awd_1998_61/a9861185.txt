Abstract    :
              9861185
      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              establish the feasibility  of producing plants tolerant to rapid temperature
              drops to freezing conditions. Most  plants can survive freezing if allowed time
              to become cold acclimated at non-freezing  temperatures, due to induction of
              the COR (cold regulated) genes. However,  sudden  temperature drops to freezing
              temperatures damage most crops if they have not been
 recently cold
              acclimated. Dr. Thomashow (MSU) overexpressed the CBF1 gene in  Arabidopsis
              plants and found that CBF1 induces the COR genes and conditions plants to 
              survive freezing without prior cold acclimation. This research will determine
              whether  constitutive expression of CBF1, or other newly isolated CBF genes, is
              detrimental to  Arabidopsis plants under normal growing conditions by measuring
              plant growth, flowering  time, biochemistry and yields.
      The results
              should indicate the technical feasibility and the CBF gene with the best 
              biological properties for producing frost-tolerant crops including corn (1995
              frost  losses of more than $ 1 Billion), soy, wheat, strawberries, and
              eucalyptus. Results from Arabidopsis are particularly relevant in the closely
              related Brassica crops.   Mendel Biotechnology has an option to an exclusive
              license to commercially develop CBF
 genes and will collaborate with MSU
              during Phase I.
