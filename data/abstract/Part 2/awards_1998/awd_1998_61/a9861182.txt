Abstract    :
              9861182
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will investigate the use of fullerene chemistry to produce full density metal
              dies and molds.   An eutectic-forming alloy of tool steel powder and
              fullerene-doped binder will be  demonstrated to produce a blend of materials
              that greatly simplifies the open mold and Rapid Tooling (RT) processes for the
              fabrication of dies and molds.   Ferroboron (FeB) will be alloyed with a
              bi-modal blend of tool steel powder to assist sintering of the steel powder and
              to react diffussively most of the boron with the fullerene carbon, producing a
              high strength boron carbide matrix.  The proposed method will enable
              single-step, full-density, consolidation with linear shrinkage less than 1.5%
              and surface finishes better than 25 micro-inch rms. 
     If successful, this
              powder materials-based technology will produce low-cost, high performance dies
              and molds using existing rapid prototyping apparatus and rapid tooling
              processes.  Ultimately, the metal injection molding industry will benefit with
              the introduction of the new powder blends enabling much faster production with
              lower shrinkage and greatly improved surface finishes.
