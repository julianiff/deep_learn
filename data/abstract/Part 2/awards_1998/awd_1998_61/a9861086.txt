Abstract    :
              9861086
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes
              an innovative material system based on cubic SiC membranes formed on
              micro-machined silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates for advanced high
              temperature piezoresistive sensor applications. The SiC-on-insulator (SiCOI)
              structure couples high temperature benefits of SiC active layers with
              micro-machining and CMOS processing advantages of a silicon substrate. A
              material with these properties could immensely benefit automotive and aerospace
              industries by offering a superior alternative to conventional Si to fabricate
              sensors that can operate at harsh temperature (up to 500 C) environment, such
              as a combustion engine.
     Recently, Spire has developed an epitaxial
              technique to grow high quality cubic SiC layers on SOI substrates by initially
              carbonizing the top Si layer of the structure to form a SiC seed layer for
              subsequent CVD growth of SiC epitaxial material to form SiCOI wafers. In Phase
              I, Spire will develop micro-machining techniques for creating SiC membranes
              from SiCOI structures and use them to conduct a feasibility study on
              demonstrating high temperature piezoresistive sensors. Phase II will optimize
              process parameters for fabrication of SiCOI membranes aimed at developing
              commercially viable devices. Phase II will also establish a foundation for
              commercialization of the technology upon its development.
     SiCOI materials
              are generally ideal for a wide range of high temperature electronic and
              optoelectronic applications such as power devices and W photodiodes.
              Piezoresistive sensors based on SiCOI structures, in particular, have many
              applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. These sensors may be
              used as pressure, strain, force, or acceleration monitoring devices in harsh
              conditions without cooling requirements, thus resulting in significant
              reduction in cost, weight, and volume of the system.
