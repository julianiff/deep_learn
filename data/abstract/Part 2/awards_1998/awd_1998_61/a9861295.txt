Abstract    :
              9861295
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project project
              would develop an affordable data gathering technology that would for the first
              time enable two or three dimensional motion to be analyzed in real time in the
              classrooms of physical science, physics, and mathematics. This technology would
              be applicable to middle school through college teaching. It's unique features
              would be: real time 6OHz operation for immediate feedback; use of inexpensive,
              common video camera technology; three dimensional analysis capability; platform
              independence; affordability.   The technology developed would consist of
              specialized circuitry and software to detect and track objects in the field of
              view of two video cameras simultaneously, and to compute the nature of the
              motion in three dimensions. It would also be useful in the study of two
              dimensional representations of three dimensional phenomena, visualization, and
              in the mathematics of detection and position analysis.
     The commercial
              potential of this innovation is sizable: The analysis of motion is a
              cornerstone in physics and physical science, taught in tens of thousands of
              classrooms each year. This potential market is already in place, using much
              older technologies. Through this innovation a significant benefit could be
              realized in teaching, and a substantial market reached.
