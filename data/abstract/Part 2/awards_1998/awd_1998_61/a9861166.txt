Abstract    :
              9861166
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses
              a fundamental hindrance to the development of the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell
              (DMFC).  Currently, a major obstacle inhibiting DMFC performance is the
              phenomenon of methanol crossover through the polymer electrolyte membrane,
              which causes cathode depolarization resulting in significant performance loss. 
              This Phase I program extends PSI's expertise in developing high performance
              electrocatalysts and electrodes for this system into the area of methanol
              permeation.  Our approach is to utilize the unique structural and electrical
              properties of carbon nanotubes to create a composite membrane structure, which
              will inhibit methanol crossover while maintaining high electrical and ionic
              conductivity.  Successful completion of this Phase I effort will result in a
              power density increase of as much as 20% for the DMFC.
     Successful
              development of the technology will substantially improve the performance and
              cost effectiveness of direct methanol fuel cells for both military and
              commercial applications.
