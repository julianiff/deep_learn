Abstract    :
              9861462
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              addresses environmental concerns facing the cadmium telluride (CdTe) device
              industry.  CdTe is widely used in  infrared detectors and more recently in
              photovoltaic (PV) devices, which are anticipated to provide a significant
              portion of the world's electric power.  As the PV device  industry expands, it
              is confronted with rising waste-disposal costs and increasingly stringent
              environmental regulations.  Thin-film PV modules contain less than 0.1% of
              metals relative to large bulk wastestreams, for which conventional recycling
              methods are impractical and wasteful.  However, the minute quantities of Cd
              classify the modules as hazardous waste.  Their disposal costs can run into the
              $400-$1000/ton range.  This project will explore an innovative closed-loop,
              electro-chemical approach to recycle CdTe/CdS devices.  Phase I will identify
              process parameters to remove, separate and retrieve the semiconductor layers. 
              The data will be used to design a compact recycling capability that maximizes
              efficiency, minimizes processing steps, and avoids waste storage and
              transport.
     This closed-loop recycling technology primarily targets the
              CdTe thin-film photovoltaic industry.  It offers a timely and expedient
              solution to manage manufacturing waste and module disposal.  Its implementation
              could save over 80% on disposal costs and mitigate the economic burden of
              environmental compliance.  It also has potential applications for recycling
              semiconductor devices in the infrared, sensor, and flat-panel display
              industries.
