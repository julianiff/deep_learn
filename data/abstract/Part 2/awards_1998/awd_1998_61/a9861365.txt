Abstract    :
              9861365
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate the enhanced performance of membrane based gas liquid contactors to
              abate SO2 emissions from flue gas.  SO2 present in flue gas streams leads to
              deforestation and damage to crops and property as a result of it's
              participation in the formation of acid rain.  Commercial gas liquid membrane
              contactors use a liquid absorbent to allow selective removal from a flue gas
              stream.  The process is a variation of the traditional Wellman Lord process,
              which uses an aqueous Na2SO3 solution as an absorbent.  Compact Membrane
              Systems, Inc. (CMS) will develop a nonporous perfluorocopolymer membrane
              deposited on the microporous substrate to prevent progressive wetting out of
              the substrate by the liquid, typically aqueous phase.  This improves and
              sustains the improved SO2 removal efficiencies.  In addition, it is anticipated
              that the perfluorocopolymer layer will curb the transmission of acid vapors
              into the flue gas phase and reduce some of the oxidation of the sulfite in the
              absorbent to sulfate as a result of the excess O2 in the flue gas.
     The
              enhanced performance of membrane based gas liquid contactors to abate SO2
              emissions from flue gas is of considerable interest to ore processors, many oil
              and natural gas processors particularly those which have to treat tail gases
              from gas sweetening processes.
