Abstract    :
              9861209
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes
              to conduct research on turbo recording methods for both magnetic and optical
              storage systems and implement these methods in a Turbo Recording Chip. This
              chip provides the potential for substantial increases in recording density and
              data transfer rates for a wide range of magnetic and optical recording
              technologies. Recording is often modeled as a noisy channel with memory. The
              "analog" character of the noise of the recording channel implies that soft
              decision decoding can provide significant benefits. Turbo coding, a relatively
              new and exciting coding technique involves a powerful code construction with an
              iterative, soft decision decoding. This project considers the issues involved
              in the construction of a turbo-coding chip for recording that will provide the
              means for encoding and decoding that effectively utilize the memory of the
              channel near its theoretical potential.
     This technology would be
              particularly suited for the magnetic tape industry where the market for
              magnetic recording equipment is estimated at over 10 billion per year and the
              need for magnetic tape density is accelerating.
