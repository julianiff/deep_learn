Abstract    :
              9861232
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead
              to a new thermochemical method, "Jaguar 2" (J2), and new software that will
              demonstrate that the J2 method yields accurate thermochemical data at a low
              computational cost. Schrodinger, Inc. will develop and refine quantum chemical
              techniques to improve the accuracy of the J2 terms, and will experiment with
              different quantum chemical methods and parameter functional forms within the
              basic J2 model. Schrodinger has previously developed limited correlation
              schemes (in which different types and basis sets can be used for different
              regions), and these will be employed and tested within the J2 model. The J2
              software will also include automated methods to improve treatment of
              transition-metal-containing systems and other difficult cases. With this Phase
              I software, expert users will be able to calculate highly accurate transition
              states, heats of formation, dissociation energies, and pKa's. Schrodinger will
              test the performance of the method on these properties for a variety of
              systems, including some organometallic cases.
    Accurate J2 thermochemical
              software that allowed routine calculation of thermochemical properties for
              large molecules would lead to rapid advances in many areas of chemistry, from
              catalysis to drug binding. The model's ability to help predict reaction
              barriers, reaction rates, relative bond strengths, and other critical
              information will lead to an enormous market among both experimental and
              computational chemists.
