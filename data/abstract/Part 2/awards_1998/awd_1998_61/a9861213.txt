Abstract    :
              9861213
     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop design tools for high- performance cavitating pump inducers and
              impellers.  An innovative inducer design approach will be taken using bowed
              blading, sweep, and incidence, plus cover treatment concepts.  In laboratory
              tests Phase I will explore tradeoffs between blade shape,  loading, and
              cavitation.  Blade design parameters such as solidity, leading edge shape
              (sweep), cant angle, tip speed, and clearance and thickness effects will be 
              investigated in the laboratory by means of steady and dynamic measurements and
              flow visualization techniques.  Design tools, including computational fluid
              dynamics (CFD), will be evaluated for modeling both non-cavitating and
              cavitating performance to understand this design problem further.  Since  pumps
              must currently be operated at low speed due to cavitation design limitations,
              they are limited in efficiency and reliable operation over a wide flow range. 
              These new design tools are expected to model cavitation performance effectively
              and thereby to advance rocket propulsion technologies and  overcome current
              industrial pump limits.
     Commercial applications are expected in aerospace
              and industrial pump companies.  The anticipated technology and design tools
              will be introduced  to industrial and rocket engine turbopump manufacturers via
              a  a design software system.  Since energy consumed by industrial pumps is
              about one-quarter of that used by vehicles, the expected improvements in pump
              efficiency may also tranlate into significant  energy conservation.
