Abstract    :
              9861157
	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Mathsoft
              will create a new software program and assessment tool that will manipulate
              images obtained from the World-Wide Web in support of the grade 8-12
              curriculum.  Through construction of images containing special effects,
              students engage in project-oriented, collaborative learning, publication of
              their work on the Internet, and integration of mathematics with writing, art,
              and computer science.  The project builds on technology developed at the
              University of Washington under two distinct NSF-supported research
              investigations: one on the use of image processing in K-12 mathematics
              education and the other on assessment of student learning from their textual
              constructions in the subjects of probability and statistics.  Concomitantly
              developing and testing an assessment framework that will allow teachers to
              easily determine what students are getting of their web-based mathematical
              experiences should serve to facilitate teacher adoption of the approach.
	The
              concept of developing a web-oriented mathematical image editor that allows
              students to manipulate graphical images exploits the mathematical nature of
              multimedia objects found on the World-Wide Web.  It has potential for
              interdisciplinary applications across the curriculum to support art, writing,
              and science teaching.  It also could serve to teach the foundations of
              scientific visualization and to give students experience with real world visual
              applications such as data encryption, image morphing, and, mathematical
              descriptions of visual objects.
