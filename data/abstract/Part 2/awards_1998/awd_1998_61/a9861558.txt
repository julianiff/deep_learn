Abstract    :
              9861558
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              develop methods and instrumentation which will permit evaluation of the
              thickness and integrity of thin film protective coatings on surfaces.  The
              proposed techniques are based on the company's Multi Photon Detection (MPD)
              technology, a radioanalytic method which uses exempt amounts of radioisotope
              and provides 1,000 fold sensitivity improvements over current methods.  By
              selectively incorporating appropriate radioactive tags in the protective
              surface film layer and imaging the surface distribution of the tags using the
              MPD Imager, the thickness and uniformity of the coating layers may be measured
              with unprecedented precision.  Using this technique surface layer thickness can
              be measured down to monolayer levels.
     If successful, the techniques
              developed under this project could result in a powerful new tool for measuring
              the initial properties of surface coating layers and their behavior under
              diverse operating conditions.  This tool will have widespread applicability in
              production and process control methods as well as the longer term monitoring of
              wear and corrosion effects in large mechanical systems.
