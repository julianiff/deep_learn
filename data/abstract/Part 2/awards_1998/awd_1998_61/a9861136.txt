Abstract    :
              9861136
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              evaluate a novel approach to biooxidize refractory chalcopyrite ore
              concentrates.   Chalcopyrite is a sulfidic copper ore which has a negative
              environmental impact upon smelting due to SO2 production, but which has proven
              difficult to process by approaches such as biooxidation.The proposed work will
              evaluate leach rates from a chalcopyrite ore concentrate in a novel integrated
              bioleaching system.  . The dissolution of chalcopyrite should be greatly
              accelerated due to system electrochemistry, favorable thermodynamics at
              elevated temperature, the presence of microbial Fe (II) and sulfur oxidizers,
              and control of particular operational parameters.  Analytical techniques such
              as ESCA and SEM/EDX will be used to monitor reactions on pyrite and
              chalcopyrite surfaces.  Metal solubilization will be monitored by inductively
              coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP).  The research objectives of this project are
              to verify the acceleration of copper leach rates and to demonstrate
              thermodynamic and electrochemical control of surface reactions under a defined
              set of system parameters.  This investigation, if successful, would directly
              result in the development of a new process for utilizing reserves of refractory
              chalcopyrite ores.
     The potential market is estimated to be in the
              hundreds of millions of dollars.  The technology could easily be integrated to
              scale with current mining practices and will substantially reduce the
              dependence of the mining industry on smelting.
