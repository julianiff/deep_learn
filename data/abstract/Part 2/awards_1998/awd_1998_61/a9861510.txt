Abstract    :
              9861510
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems will develop fiber-optic, magnetic field sensor
              systems employing a novel sensor probe technology, proprietary demultiplexing
              and signal processing techniques, and compact systems packaging, to provide
              real-time process control in semiconductor manufacturing.  An expandable
              two-sensor system will be demonstrated in this Phase I activity.  The company
              will develop and implement this system based on new fiber-optic magnetic field
              sensor probes, new fiber components enabling optical demultiplexing subsystems
              with improved signal to noise ratios, and novel demultiplexing subsystems which
              accurately measure very small changes in sensed information.
