Abstract    :
              9861252
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              addresses the abatement of hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators.  These
              devices lack of accuracy because of hysteresis, creep, and other
              nonlinearities. Maximum error due to hysteresis can be as much as 20-30% of the
              path covered if the actuators are not under closed-loop control.  The Phase I
              approach is expected to compensate for this non-linearity and should reduce
              this error source by a factor of 100 or more compared to open loop
              performance.
     Piezoelectric actuators are critical in ultra-high precision
              machining such as diamond turning machines, in scanning probe microscopes, in
              lithography machines, and for a wide range of active vibration control and
              active chatter control systems.  All of these applications are compromised to
              some extent, either in accuracy or in speed or both, by piezoelectric actuator
              hysteresis and creep.
