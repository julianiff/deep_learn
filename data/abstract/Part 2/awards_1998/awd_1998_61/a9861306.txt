Abstract    :
              9861306
     This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project. 
              While many forms of chemical waste are easy to destroy using simple oxidation
              processes, others, including propellants, explosives, dyes, halocarbons, and
              wastes tainted with heavy metals, are not. However, these materials, as well as
              simple organics, can be treated using titanium dioxide (TiO2)-assisted
              photocatalysis. While all advanced oxidation processes operate by generating
              hydroxyl radicals (OH*) , TiO2-assisted photocatalysis has the greatest
              potential for inexpensive operation due to the fact that it requires only air
              or water and sunlight. The primary drawback of TiO2-assisted photocatalysis is
              the low solar absorptivity of TiO2,, which yields low oxidation rates. In this
              project, Ultramet will fabricate a novel blackbody cavity of the TiO2 catalyst
              material, which will result in virtually all of the incident radiation being
              absorbed by the catalyst. This material, which has high surface area, high
              absorptivity, and low pressure drop, can be used as a fixed catalyst bed,
              eliminating the need to separate the catalyst from the effluent stream. Doping
              of the TiO2 with other catalytic oxides or noble metal clusters will also be
              investigated.
     The applications for a highly efficient supported catalyst
              are numerous. With >65 metric tons of hazardous solvent waste and 60 metric
              tons of other chemical wastes generated annually by the chemical process
              industry, the need for such technology is immense. Military stockpiles are also
              in need of waste remediation. Moreover, although the U.S. is the leading
              producer of waste chemicals, other industrial countries could benefit from this
              inexpensive remediation technology.
