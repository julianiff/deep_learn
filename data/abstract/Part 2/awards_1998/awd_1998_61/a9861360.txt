Abstract    :
              9861360
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for
              research on confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using fast bootstrap
              methods, and ways to make bootstrapping feasible for large data sets. Classical
              inference (intervals and tests) methods are known to be inaccurate when the
              underlying assumptions are violated, the usual case in practice. For example,
              skewness causes the usual t-test to be in error. The new methods would be an
              order of magnitude (power of n, where n is the sample size)  more accurate in
              general than classical inferences. Bootstrap methods are a promising
              alternative to classical inferences, and can handle complex statistics
              including modem robust statistics, but are slow and have been little used in
              practice. The methods proposed are 17 times faster than other bootstrap
              methods.
     The methods are fast enough to be seamlessly incorporated into
              standard software, alongside or instead of classical inferences. This provides
              statistical practitioners a realistic alternative to easy but inaccurate
              classical inferences and non-robust methods. The competitive advantage to the
              firm that does this first is a major opportunity.  The large sample methods
              would be attractive in the thriving data mining market.
