Abstract    :
              9861425

     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop, implement and validate a neural inverse control environment, to
              implement the controller in a ventilator for patients with lung disease or
              trauma.  NeuroDimension Inc. will innovate adaptive inverse control by adding a
              fixed sub-module (adapted off-line) for improved speed of adaptation, comparing
              two alternatives both theoretically and practically.  A communication protocol
              will also be developed to allow the neural network package to interact in
              real-time with an on-line system.  The control architecture will use a low-cost
              microcontroller for on-line plant control, and a PC running NeuroSolutions will
              be used for off-line parameter optimization.
