Abstract    :
              9861247
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project  details
              an analog parallel distributed (APD) solution to the shortest path-problem, the
              time complexity of which depends on the required accuracy of the solution. The
              algorithm is based on Bellman's formulation of the SPP. Rather than
              implementing a classic gradient descent in our system as is typical, a new
              energy minimization technique was developed. The resulting modified gradient
              descent has the important benefit of not stabilizing at local minima. It also
              permits a straightforward distributed VLSI implementation which with the
              currently available technology is expected to have a peak accuracy within 0.5%
              and time constant of a fraction of a microsecond. A powerful decomposition
              technique has already been devised and used to characterize the dynamic
              behavior of the system.
     Applications of the algorithm involve analog
              routing assessment or routing control and search problems in chip-level
              artificial intelligence. The decomposition method may be useful in analyzing
              the APD paradigm for other combinatorial problems on graphs.
