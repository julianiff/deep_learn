Abstract    :
              9891050
      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will evaluate the feasibility of developing gas-cluster ion-beam (GCIB)
              sputtering of semiconductor surfaces into innovative tools for electronic
              materials. This research will evaluate GCIB sputtering for secondary-ion mass
              spectrometer (SIMS) instruments. The overriding motivation for this R&D is the
              critical need in the semiconductor industry for techniques and methods which
              can etch in a highly uniform manner and thus facilitate accurate and sensitive
              depth measurements. Future generations of microelectronics must have
              ultra-shallow junction depths, higher doping levels and improvement in
              interface and doping abruptness to meet the 1997 SIA Roadmap. Dynamic SIMS is
              the most sensitive technique for analysis of semiconductors. State-of-the-art
              instruments employ energetic, monatomic ion beams to sputter the analytical
              surface. These roughen the surface and limit depth resolution. To achieve the
              required subnanometer depth resolutions in SIMS new sputter beams must be
              developed. GCIB methods with singly ionized argon or oxygen clusters (of 1,000)
              sputter with nearly atomic depth resolution, and high secondary-ion yields.
              Phase I will construct a prototype system to demonstrate analytical
              feasibility. Phase II will develop dedicated ion sources for critical analysis
              to provide depth profiling for SIMS, and Auger-electron and x-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopies.
      The proposed technology will enable analysis of
              next-generation semiconductor devices having much higher performance and
              enhance manufacturing yields. Epion is the first and only to manufacture GCIB
              systems. The basic GCIB technique will have a wide applicability to many areas
              of electronic materials processing and manufacturing industry.
