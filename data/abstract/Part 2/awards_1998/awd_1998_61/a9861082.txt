Abstract    :
              9861082
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase l project will
              explore inherently low cost, mass-producable conductive composite materials for
              Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Current PEM fuel cell bipolar
              plates often achieve good overall technical performance, but have some
              combination of high materials, manufacturing and assembly cost. This high cost
              is a barrier to market penetration of fuel cells. In order to develop a fuel
              cell bipolar plate, which has acceptable technical performance as well as low
              cost, novel composite materials amenable to low cost manufacture needs to be
              developed. These novel materials will be used to design exceptional bipolar
              plates through an integrated, interdisciplinary engineering design approach. In
              Phase I, novel composite materials amenable to low cost manufacture of fuel
              cell bipolar plates will be identified through a material-testing program. This
              program will specifically include the effects of low-cost manufacture on the
              material properties.
     Successful completion of the project will lead to
              low cost, mass-manufacturable fuel cell stacks, thereby enhancing United States
              competitiveness in the emerging markets for fuel cells and leading to greatly
              accelerated market penetration of fuel cells, especially in low cost
              applications such as light duty vehicles.
