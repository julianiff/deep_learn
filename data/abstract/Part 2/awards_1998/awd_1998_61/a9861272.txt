Abstract    :
              9861272
     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore tough high-temperature ceramic materials that are superior to
              metal alloys.  A low-cost, continuously processed beta-silicon carbide (SiC)
              fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (CMC) will be developed.  The ceramic
              matrix, derived from polycarbosilane converted into polyethny-carbosilane,
              results when the precursor is cross-linked by exposure to ultraviolet (UV)
              irradiation, pyrolyzed in inert atmosphere and sintered.  A high purity, dense,
              sub-micron crystalline SiC CMC is expected with Si-C stoichiometry that is
              reproducible, has low manufacturing capital costs, and excellent life-cycle and
              physical properties at elevated temperatures (about 1400 degrees Centigrade). 
              Since the polymer precursor is very fluid, conventional plastics technology can
              be used to produce large components.
     Commercial applications are wide and
              encompass oxidation and water-resistant hardware components for automotive and
              jet engines, exhaust deflectors, radiant burners, hot gas filters, heat
              exchangers, and turbine combustion liners.
