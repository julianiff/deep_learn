Abstract    :
              9861411
     The tremendous growth in access to information can create a "fire
              hose" effect, in which information is useless without effective methods for
              distinguishing what is relevant from what is not.  This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase I from Cognitive Technologies, Inc. addresses the
              problem of search, especially Internet search, from a unique perspective as
              research agents that mediate between, and on behalf of, the user and more
              traditional information retrieval systems.  The innovative features of the
              approach are as follows:  it provides direct support for users in constructing
              and elaborating mental models of the research context that motivates the search
              behavior; leverages such context with fast, parallel inferential search that
              filters and organizes search results from traditional search engines; supports
              critical thinking as it bears on the research issues under investigation; and
              envisions research as a collaborative process in which the fruits of each
              researcher's labors may be published electronically as active knowledge
              structures that can inform and organize subsequent searches, and which can form
              the basis of improved understanding of the domain.
     Direct commercial
              applications of the proposed integration of intelligent agent (IA) technology
              with a technology for explicitly representing a user's mental model of a domain
              include information access and management on the Internet and in vertical
              markets; namely, preparing briefs for case or patent law; market analysis for
              traders and brokers; intelligence analysis; primary and continuing education;
              university-based research; and conducting and managing national research
              interests.
