Abstract    :
              9861229 
     In this SBIR Phase I application, Repligen proposes:  (1) to
              synthesize a solid phase array of about 20,000 novel chemical structures with
              molecular features consistent with heparin/heparan sulfate; ( 2) to screen this
              biased library for those structures which show affinity for vascular
              endothelial growth factor (VEGF); (3) to evaluate solid phase compounds which
              show binding activity for VEGF in a series of secondary assays and to select
              those with specificity for VEGF and moderate (i.e. KD=10-7 to 10-8 M) binding
              affinity; and (4) to evaluate 3-5 selected solid phase compounds as potential
              novel affinity matrices for VEGF purification. Successful completion of the
              Phase I objectives of this program will produce a new tool for the purification
              of VEGF, a potentially important new therapeutic protein. More broadly, success
              in completing the Phase I objectives will establish the feasibility of this
              approach. 
     General application of the technology which would be developed
              during Phase 2 of the proposed project can provide new affinity chromatography
              matrices for a wide variety of commercially important proteins. New protein
              purification tools such as these affinity matrices will be critical for the
              successful commercialization of many proteins produced through biotechnology.
