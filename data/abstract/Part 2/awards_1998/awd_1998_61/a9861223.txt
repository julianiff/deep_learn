Abstract    :
              9861223
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach for fabricating aligned carbon
              nanotubes for use as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tips.  The feasibility of
              manufacturing a single aligned carbon nanotube on an AFM cantilever will be
              demonstrated, in a process suitable for large-scale manufacturing.  The
              proposed approach raises interrelated material-process compatibility challenges
              and design considerations, which have not previously been considered within the
              same context.  The importance of this work to critical dimension metrology for
              wafer fabrication and use of AFMs for mask repair has led to endorsements by
              Texas Instruments and SEMATECH.  Xidex plans to develop, manufacture and sell
              integrated carbon nanotube tips for in-line CD metrology and mask repair tools
              used within the semiconductor industry.  These tips will also be used for
              lateral force microscopy, precision surface profiling, biological sampling and
              other nanoprobe research instrumentation.
