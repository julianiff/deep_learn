Abstract    :
              9861313
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project is to
              synthesize a series of new conjugated polymers as active materials for solid
              state polymer lasers. Recent efforts to make diode lasers from semiconducting
              polymers are hindered by limitations to net gain, which include photoinduced
              absorption (PA), concentration quenching and self-absorption. Dilute blends of
              conjugated polymers, the subject of this proposal, can solve these problems
              through Forster energy transfer. We are going to synthesize a series of
              alkoxyphenyl-PPV and alkylphenyl-PPV as the host polymer to demonstrate and
              develop conjugated polymer blends as high gain/low loss laser materials and to
              optimize the Forster energy transfer from host to guest. Successful completion
              of the project will provide polymers with properties of higher molecular weight
              and good solubility, high photoluminescence efficiency, good compatibility and
              maximum spectra overlap with the guest polymers. Subsequently, in Phase II,
              photo-pumped stimulated emission will be used to guide the fabrication of the
              electrical pumped laser devices.
     The research will make an important
              contribution to development of efficient, robust materials providing light
              weight, low power addressable arrays of light sources for a broad range of
              applications from simple alphanumeric displays to high information content flat
              panel displays.
