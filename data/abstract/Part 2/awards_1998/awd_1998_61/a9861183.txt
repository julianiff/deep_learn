Abstract    :
              9861183
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate a novel process to produce low-cost heat sink plates containing
              arrays of wickless micro-heat pipes with effective capillary diameters on the
              order of 50-200 microns. As the speed of advanced electronic systems has
              increased dramatically in recent years, there has been growing interest in
              substrates containing arrays of micro-heat pipes for use in the thermal control
              of high power transistors and electronic circuits. The effective thermal
              conductivity of an individual micro-heat pipe can be orders of magnitude higher
              than the thermal conductivity of pure copper metal. No fabrication method
              currently exists to economically produce low-cost substrates containing arrays
              of micro-heat pipes. In Phase I, micro-heat pipes will be fabricated on a
              metallic substrate that exhibit a thermal expansion similar to silicon-based
              electronic components. The proposed micro-heat pipe plates will exhibit
              effective thermal conductivities significantly higher than pure copper metal
              and will be used commercially as heat sinks, heat spreaders, and thermal core
              materials.
     Micro-heat pipe substrates may be applied directly to the
              thermal management of commercial electronic systems such as heat sinks, thermal
              cores or heat spreading devices.
