Abstract    :
              9861146
     This small business innovation Phase I research project concerns
              flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) of mixed metal precursors in EtOH to produce low
              cost, mixed metal oxide nanopowders (n powders), with controlled particle size,
              phase, chemical purity and high surface areas. FSP production of >250 g/h
              mullite (3Al,O,,2SiO,), P" alumna (Li,,.,,Na, .67AII0.67017)' strontium
              aluminosilicate (SrO'AI,O,'2SiO,) and CeO, n powders has been proven. As
              produced powders are unagglomerated, often single crystals with 10 to 100 nm
              ave. particle sizes and surface areas of 120 to 10 rn~/g. Tal Materials
              proposes to use FSP to develop new, low cost routes to ZrO/CeO, and PrO~CeO,
              for automotive three way catalysts (TWCs). FSP provides the potential to
              produce high surface area, sinter resistant n powders with tailored composition
              in a single step. The Phase II objectives are to: (1) define how SP process
              variables and metal ratios control phase and phase purity, particle size and
              size distribution, and catalytic (oxygen storage capacity) properties of
              ZrO~CeO, and PrO~CeO, n powders; (2) identify compositions that offer superior
              catalytic activity with resistance to sintering, and (3) establish FSP design
              parameters required to scale up to 10 kg/h of n powders. Phase II objectives
              will be to use Phase I data to: (1) scale up production of n powders to 20 to
              50 kg/day; (2) expand the scope of materials reduced to develop new and
              advanced TWC products; (3) develop related doped n CeO, for other applications,
              ie. for fuel cells.
     Currently, the multimillion dollar U.S. Automotive
              TWC components market is served entirely by non U.S. suppliers (e.g. Rhone
              Poulenc). Tal Materials, proposes to extend its expertise in the production of
              mixed metal nanopowders, to produce new, low cost high surface area, sinter
              resistant and tailored Zr/Ce and Pr/Ce oxide n powders for TWC applications.
              Tal Materials will work with local Michigan Industry to become a U.S. supplier
              of TWC components. Expertise developed in the process will provide a new market
              for Tal and the potential to develop products for related markets, e.g. in
              solid oxide fuel cells.
