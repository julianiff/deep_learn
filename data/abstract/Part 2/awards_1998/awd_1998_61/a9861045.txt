Abstract    :
              9861045
     This small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) as a viable
              computational tool for the prediction of gas-particle flow phenomena.
              Present-day turbulence models use many ad-hoc procedures to represent
              turbulence fluctuations and also particle transport by these fluctuations. LES
              removes this empiricism by computing the dominant, unsteady, large scale
              turbulence. Unlike a Direct Simulation, it allows calculation at realistic
              Reynolds numbers and at a reasonable cost. We propose to extend this technique
              to include gas-solid flows. In Phase I, we will carry out a careful study of
              the role of LES (and sub-grid scale modeling for both fluid stress and
              velocity) in the context of particulate dispersion, mixing, collision and
              deposition. Particulate, turbulent flows in an isotropic and channel geometry
              are the two test cases chosen. Results will be validated by comparing LES with
              prior experimental and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. In Phase II, LES
              capabilities will be extended to Body-Fitted and Unstructured grids, needed to
              tackle complex geometries.
     The specific objectives of the Phase I study
              are two-fold:  (i) develop and validate Gas-Particle Large Eddy Simulation
              tool;  and (ii) assess the impact of LES on particulate phenomena such as
              dispersion, deposition and collision.  The development of the LES tool for
              two-phase flows will have a deep and far-reaching impact on a staggeringly
              diverse list of areas ranging from chemical/pharmaceutical industry to
              environmental pollution control.
