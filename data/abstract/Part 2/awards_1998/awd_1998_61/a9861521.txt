Abstract    :
              9861521
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will make
              a low-cost, low-power, lightweight electroluminescent illumination source for
              use in flat panel displays, based on novel inorganic-organic hybrid materials. 
              Though 90 percent of all current flat panel displays are based on liquid
              crystal displays (LCD), LCDs are difficult to make, consume a great deal of
              power, cannot be viewed in bright light and must be mounted on glass substrates
              making them fragile.  These failings have spurred development into new display
              technology.  To date, inorganic-based systems, while robust, are not easily
              processible. Organic-based systems are easily processible, but are not
              sufficiently robust.  The proposed materials will possess the robustness of
              inorganic systems combined with the ease of processing offered by organic
              systems (e.g., solution casting). This project will progress in three stages: 
              1) synthesis of the molecular precursors; 2) casting films of these precursors
              onto ITO coated substrates; and 3) evaluating the electroluminescent behavior
              of the final device.
     The proposed device is expected to generate blue
              light from a 1" diagonal display at voltages ~10V and have a luminosity ~1000
              cd/m2.  Potential commercial applications are small area back-lights mounted on
              highly portable displays which have a U.S. market potential of $1 billion.
