Abstract    :
              9891445
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will  develop a novel hybrid manufacturing process to reduce  production time
              of refractory foam materials to a few hours, rather than the hundreds of hours
              currently required, providing a large reduction in overall processing cost. 
              The  process will combine chemical vapor deposition/infiltration (CVD/CVI)
              technology with microwave technology.  Recent studies have shown that silicon
              carbide (SiC) foam production by CVD/CVI can be done in at least one order of
              magnitude less time when microwave heating is employed.  Further, it is
              expected that  properties of the formed product can be  maintained and possibly
              enhanced.  The concept will be demonstrated  in a commercial SiC foam
              manufacturing process.
     A potential 95% reduction is expected in the cost
              of fabricating SiC foam, allowing penetration of the catalyst support market
              for exhaust aftertreatment, as well as large additional markets such as water
              treatment catalyst supports and structural materials for aerospace.  In
              addition, this technology can be applied to ceramic matrix composite processing
              with similar benefits.
