Abstract    :
              9861546
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              explore novel low-cost manufacturing technology for micro-fabrication of vacuum
              microelectronics components from self-organized alumina ceramic. The approach
              is based on self-assembled Inorganic precursor, that can be anisotropically
              etched due to its unique nanoscale morphology The proposed innovation allows
              the creation of high aspect ratio high resolution micro-components, and does
              not require expensive deep X-ray lithography for micro-machining. The devices
              of interest include vacuum integrated circuits, as well as high power and high
              efficiency vacuum micro-devices with high mechanical, temperature and radiation
              stability. The capabilities of the technology at the proof-of-concept stage
              will be evaluated during the Phase I based on the prototype vacuum triode.
              During Phase II NRC will optimize and scale-up the technology, and Phase III
              will be a focused on commercialization.
     Ultrafast, radiation and
              temperature resistant micro-devices can potentially enable new level of
              performance and functionality of vacuum microelectronics. The application
              potential of the proposed technology is exceptional. Any application requiring
              high power electronic devices capable of functioning in the harsh conditions,
              such as space, satellite communications, radars, deep well drilling, control of
              nuclear reactors, and others, will benefit from this approach. Spin-off
              applications will include fast response low power low power sensors and
              actuators, flat panel displays, electrostatic thrusters, chemical processing
              micro-systems, and other micro-electro-mech
