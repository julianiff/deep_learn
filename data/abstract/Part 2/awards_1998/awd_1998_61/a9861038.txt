Abstract    :
              9861038
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop a wide-bandwidth digitizer with adequate memory storage needed for
              recording single-shot laser pulse events for studying plasma confinement.  The
              laser pulses used in such studies have bandwidths greater than 10 GHz. 
              Commercially available digitizers either have inadequate bandwidth, or are
              prohibitively expensive.  A digitizer with greater than 10 GHz bandwidth,
              real-time memory acquisition, and a sampling rate of 16 GigaSamples/s (GSa/s)
              has been demonstrated.  The goal of this research is to achieve 0.5 picosecond
              aperture uncertainty which requires extremely linear digitizing comparators. 
              Negative feedback has been used to obtain a certain degree of linearity, but
              not enough to obtain the required performance (an aperture uncertainty of 0.5
              ps is equivalent to 6 effective bits at 10 GHz and 8 effective bits at 2.5
              GHz).  A superconductive logic for correcting any remaining nonlinear effects
              in real time has been developed.  In Phase I, a goal is to demonstrate this
              method at 20 GSa/s.  The feasibility for providing 25 ns of on-chip 20 GHz
              memory and self-triggering capability will also be demonstrated.
     If
              successful, the project will enable better measurements of sub-nanosecond
              events for high-end electronics, communications networks, and high-speed
              lasers.  Other government applications include digital radar, electronic
              warfare, and secure communications.  The prime commercial application will be a
              general-purpose transient digitizer.  The successful fielding of a transient
              digitizer from this project could compensate for the recent withdrawal of a
              U.S. product, which has resulted in the ascendancy of a foreign digitizer
              product to the position of highest performance.
