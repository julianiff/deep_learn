Abstract    :
              9861488
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              conduct research to develop a high speed imaging x-ray detector for x-rays from
              100 eV 20 KeV.  It will employ a novel silicon/diamond film based microchannel
              plate (MCP), together with in situ x-ray photocathodes.  Silicon wafers are
              micromachined to form high aspect ratio microchannel plates with
              photolithographic spatial precision.  The doped diamond film activation,
              possible on silicon, but not glass MCP, provides a controlled strip resistance
              and very long-lived secondary emission surface.  Because of the high
              temperature capabilities of the silicon and diamond, x-ray photocathodes for
              grazing incidence may be directly deposited on the MCP surface.  This leads to
              a compact imaging x-ray detector with long life, high radiation resistance,
              high spatial and temporal resolution, low defects, high temperature operation,
              and high x-ray detection efficiency compared with existing imaging x-ray
              detectors.
     The silicon/diamond Microchannel Plate (N4CP) X-ray Detector
              will lead to new applications in medical imaging, x-ray inspection and
              scientific instrumentation, especially at high speeds, with full electronic
              image readout.  Its cost may be very competitive with glass MCP of lower
              performance.
