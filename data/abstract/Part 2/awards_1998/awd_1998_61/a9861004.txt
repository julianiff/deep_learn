Abstract    :
              9861004
     The Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study
              double entry bookkeeping with the
goal to document an application that
              supports network business organizations.  Network business 
organizations are
              a proposed solution to emerging economic needs; they enable business entities
              
to compete in naturally monopolistic contexts. An example is an operating
              system where ownership
has a natural-even desirable-need to be a monopoly. The
              proposed change allows competition to
individual ownership by collective
              owners who compare for portions of the monopoly itself.  Our Research will
              proceed in three parts:  (1) Create a mathematical model describing traditional
              double entry bookkeeping; (2) Build a prototype bookeeping system in
              partnership with a local network group to     observe and document the special
              needs of network organizations; and (3) Create a software design for large
              scale implementation based upon our research at the local community level.
              Extend the local implementation to Internet groups. 
     Upon conclusions
              reached in our Phase I study and its documentation, Phase II will:  (1) build a
              first generation, Internet aware bookkeeping program; (2) add legal language
              essential to enforce contracts among members of a network organization;  and
              (3) continue empirical validation of the bookkeeping model, its software
              application  and its piecemeal growth.   Create a bookkeeping standard for
              intellectually competitive business entities that are optimized by the
              application of language which would otherwise generate a cultural monopoly.
