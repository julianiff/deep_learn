Abstract    :
              9861289
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop an ultrasensitive magnetic sensor technology capable of operation in an
              unshielded environment.  These compact sensors will be based on superconducting
              quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that are fabricated from high temperature
              superconducting materials.  A collaborative effort between Magnesensors, UC
              Berkeley and IBM Research will employ a new design to produce high Tc SQUIDs
              operating in ambient fields with and unprecedented level of sensitivity.  This
              technology will enable the development of an entirely new generation of
              instrumentations that will find use in a wide variety of applications including
              non-destructive evaluation of cracks and corrosion in aircraft, inspection of
              ICs, homogenous immunoassays using magnetic labels, environmental monitoring
              and so on.
