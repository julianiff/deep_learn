Abstract    :
              9861001
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              integrate a large scale, validated hurricane simulation technique, a validated
              hurricane wind field model and a validated storm surge model coupled with the
              existing WAM wave model (The WAMDI Group, 1988) to develop the first risk
              consistent modeling of the combined action of wind, storm surge and waves
              produced by hurricanes.  The storm surge/wave analysis and resulting flood maps
              produced by FEMA were not developed in a statistically rigorous manner, and
              thus the true return periods associated with the 100 year flood level is, in
              fact, not known.  To assess the risk of storm damage to structures, the
              combined action of wind and flood (including both surge and wave runup) must be
              treated as they are inherently coupled, and damage in many cases is produced by
              a combination of the two storm perils.  The simulation approach, which employs
              an extensively validated wind field model, will determine simultaneous values
              of wind speed, storm surge and wave runup that can be analyzed to assess the
              risk associated with anyone of the individual perils or the risk associated
              with any combination of multiple perils.  This body of work will represent the
              first risk consistent study of the combined action of wind, storm surge and
              wave action.
     The primary commercial application for this research
              includes a new risk consistent approach for insurance companies to assess their
              true total risk.  The new approach may yield further business opportunities for
              insurance companies in many cases, relieving the Federal Government of some of
              its risk.  Other potential applications include the utility industry, who with
              this research will be able to produce more cost effective transmission and
              distribution system designs in coastal areas.
