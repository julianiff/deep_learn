Abstract    :
              9861065
     This  Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              focused on the development of a cyanide detection system. Current methods for
              cyanide detection are either quite slow and labor intensive, unreliable, or
              require expensive, instrumentation. The method proposed should result in a
              portable cyanide detection unit which is rapid, accurate and easily used. The
              basis of the detection method is the chemical reaction of cyanide with a
              specially designed surface coating, and the detection of this reaction using
              surface enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). Through proper design of
              the surface coating it should be possible to "tune" the sensitivity of the
              detection system to a variety of applications.
     The commercial
              applications of this technology are significant. There are several thousand
              active mines utilizing cyanide leach technology to extract gold and silver, and
              more than 200,000 inactive mines. The ability to rapidly and accurately monitor
              cyanide use should substantially increase the efficiency of the extraction
              process, providing large cost savings; it will also greatly facilitate the
              protection of the environment through monitoring of potentially toxic effluents
              from existing and inactive mines.
