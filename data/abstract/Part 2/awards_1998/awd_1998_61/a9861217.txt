Abstract    :
              9861217
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              establish the feasibility of developing an Advanced Positron Beam Source (APBS)
              that can a provide high quality pulsed positron beam suitable for a range of
              analytical instruments for materials science. The project is based on the
              latest developments in techniques to accumulate positrons from a radioactive
              source in Penning traps using a buffer gas. The technical objectives of Phase I
              are: (1) to demonstrate experimentally that positrons can be extracted from the
              magnetic field and remoderation brightness enhanced; (2) to obtain experimental
              data required for the design of a new state-of-the art compact trap; and (3) to
              design a laboratory prototype of the APBS system. The experiments will be
              performed on the UCSD positron trap. If successful, this project will provide
              the basis for demonstration of a laboratory prototype APBS in Phase II.
    
              Positron beams can be used for the evaluation of a wide range of properties of
              metals, semiconductors and polymers. A major obstacle to the commercial
              exploitation of these techniques is the lack of a suitable low-energy positron
              beam source. The APBS will fill this need by providing a compact, low-cost,
              user-friendly positron beam source that can function as a turnkey system in an
              industrial environment. The APBS will have performance characteristics that are
              not available from any other system.
