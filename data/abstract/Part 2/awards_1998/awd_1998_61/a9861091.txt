Abstract    :
              9861091
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop higher energy storage and lower cost electrode materials for
              rechargeable lithium ion batteries.  Tin based oxide materials have exhibited
              very attractive reversible charge storage capacities but high irreversible
              capacities.  A related new material is proposed that should significantly
              reduce the irreversible capacity and circumvent existing Japanese intellectual
              property barriers associated with the tin based oxide electrodes.  Precursor
              chemistries and reactive conditions will be varied to produce new candidate
              electrode materials.  The composition and microstructure of these materials
              will be determined.  Test cells will be prepared and subjected to standard
              battery performance evaluations to determine the reversible and irreversible
              capacity and cyclability of the new electrode materials.
     This project
              will develop advanced electrode materials to increase the energy delivered by
              rechargeable lithium ion batteries.  There is a very rapidly growing market for
              lithium ion batteries for consumer applications (wireless communications,
              laptop PC's, camcorders) as well as for electric and hybrid vehicle
              propulsion.
