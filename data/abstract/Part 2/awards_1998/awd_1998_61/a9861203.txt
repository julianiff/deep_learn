Abstract    :
              9861203
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes
              a novel method to synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and nickel for high
              performance magnetic recording media. Research on existing magnetic recording
              media, such as, gamma-ferric oxide, chromium dioxide and cobalt modified
              gamma-ferric oxide, is being directed towards accomplishing single domains,
              high magnetic saturation and high coercivities. Improper nucleation, growth and
              oxidation temperature control of colloidal particles, of such recording media,
              frequently results in chemically unstable particles. Concurrently,
              nanoparticles suggest many applications as storage devices due to presence of
              single domains, and transformations in the magnetic structure with induced
              magnetization on a nanometer scale. Multi-domains to single domain
              transformations and superparamagnetic behavior with reduction in particle size
              are also critical in influencing the magnetic characteristics of these
              nanoparticles. In this Phase I program, MMI proposes to synthesize
              nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and nickel to establish their potential as high
              performance materials for magnetic recording media. Coating of magnetic media
              will be pursued using a unique combination of binder, solvent, dispersant and
              plasticizer to ensure that the nanoparticles are uniformly distributed thus
              contributing to higher coercivity and magnetic saturation.
     High-density
              information storage in the magnetic recording industry, increasing efficiency
              of magnetic refrigeration cycles (refrigeration industry), metallic pastes for
              circuits and as basic material for producing industrial catalysts, sintering
              aids and sensors.
