Abstract    :
              9861318
     This Phase I research will determine the feasibility of developing
              positron-electron annihilation processes into an innovative generation of Auger
              electron spectroscopy (AES) instruments. It is well known that collisions of
              low energy positrons with solid surfaces produces copious quantities of
              secondary and Auger electrons after positron annihilation with a core level
              electron in the solid. The intrinsic signal-to-noise (S/N) of this positron AES
              (PAES) is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional electron beam
              AES (EAES) and therein lies the attraction of PAES. We will build an
              experimental positron source or beam using 22Na as the positron emitter and
              various ion optical elements to transport this beam to surfaces of samples
              placed on commercial AES instruments. This feasibility research will thus
              directly compare PAES and EAES for identical samples in order to better assess
              the possible sensitivity improvements of PAES. This research will be a
              collaboration between Charles Evans Associates and Professor David Golden at
              the University of North Texas.
     The successful development of PAES will
              introduce a more sensitive surface analysis technique for chemical analysis of
              the top atomic layers of high technology materials. This research could also
              lead to the development of positron sources to convert conventional AES
              instruments into PAES tools.
