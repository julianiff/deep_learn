Abstract    :
              9861063
     The agricultural sector accounted for approximately 31 percent of
              total US methane emissions and is a major source of C02 emissions. The
              Environmental Protection Agency, state, and local regulators are imposing new
              restrictions on confinement production facilities because of odors and the
              emission of greenhouse gases. The Phase I research project will determine the
              feasibility of collecting greenhouse gas emissions from swine confinement
              facilities and converting it into a feedstock for  production of biomass in a
              photobioreactor. Phase II research will involve the development and testing of
              a prototype "bioair" collection, processing, and photobioreactor system. Phase
              I research will involve collection of "bioair" gases from a swine production
              facility and utilizing micro algae cultures at Argonne National Laboratory for
              bioprocessing the livestock gases feedstock. In Phase II a photobioreactor will
              be developed to convert the bioair feedstock into a valuable biomass source for
              use as a feed protein, biomass product, or other higher value commercial
              product. 
     The bioair collection, processing and photobioreactor systems
              will be sold beginning in Phase III to livestock confinement operations in the
              United States and throughout the world. The system will allow producers to
              address serious environmental, worker safety, and public relations problems
              while reducing their input costs and producing commercially marketable
              co-products.
