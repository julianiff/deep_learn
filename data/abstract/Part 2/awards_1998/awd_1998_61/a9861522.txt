Abstract    :
              9861522
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore a novel fabrication method for a nonconsumable titanium boride
              (TiB2) anode used in the electrolysis of aluminum.  The conventional production
              of one ton of aluminum requires about 65-70 gigajoules of energy and about
              one-half ton of carbon (graphite) anode in the conventional Hall-Heroult
              process.   A nonconsumable anode made of TiB2 can reduce energy consumption and
              eliminate the replacement of carbon anodes as practiced in industry today. 
              TiB2 is an excellent electrical conductor with high corrosion resistance
              against metallic aluminum and molten cryolite.  In addition, the use of
              nonconsumable anodes eliminates toxic gas emissions and polycyclic aromatic
              hydrocarbons.  Unfortunately, TiB2 requires a long sintering time at high
              temperatures due to its low self-diffusion. Exaggerated grain growth creates
              internal defects during hot pressing or pressure-less sintering that lead to
              microcracking.  To counter these difficulties, Phase I will develop a reactive
              consolidation approach called Plasma Pressure Compaction (P2C).  Synthesis and
              densification of TiB2 will be achieved in the P2C process within a 15-minutes
              cycle time by using novel field-activating mechanisms.  Reactively consolidated
              TiB2 is expected to have high density, small grain size with uniform
              microstructure, and consistent mechanical properties.
     Synthesis and
              consolidation of TiB2 by P2C in a single step is anticipated to be applied in
              fabrication of TiB2 anodes for use in electrolysis of aluminum in the primary
              metals industry.
