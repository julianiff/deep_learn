Abstract    :
              9861389
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a new tool for determining the microstructure of porous materials
              including oil and natural gas reservoir rock.   This is a critical step in the
              recovery of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs around the world.  Methods
              exist for the determination of rock porosity and the distribution of pore
              sizes, but the determination of permeability, although central to oil and gas
              recovery, has remained a difficult problem.   Phase I will demonstrate the
              determination of rock microstructure using low-field nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy of hyperpolarized noble-gases.  Recent research indicates
              that certain isotopes of helium (3He) and xenon (129Xe) can be given a large
              non-equilibrium "hyperpolarization" using laser optical pumping.  This gives
              them an NMR signal two to three orders of magnitude larger than is found in
              standard proton NMR.  Furthermore, the laser-induced non-equilibrium
              polarization of 3He is independent of applied magnetic fields, thus allowing a
              reduced system cost, lower susceptibility effects, and better imaging of
              partially conductive media.   Phase I will include NMR measurements with 3He
              and 129Xe within reservoir rock as well as models of porous media.   A
              low-field imaging apparatus will be designed and built for experiments in Phase
              II.
     This technology is expected to have many applications in materials
              development and characterization as well as in oil and natural gas recovery.
