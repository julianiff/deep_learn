Abstract    :
              9861211
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves
              the development of novel "fluid catalysts" for direct, non-oxidative coupling
              of methane to alkane (C2 to C8) products. Such low molecular weight (MW)
              hydrocarbons are basic building blocks for the petrochemical industry. The
              process to be developed can have substantial advantages over other synthesis
              routes.  The catalytic process to be developed has two steps, a first step in
              which methane is chemisorbed and polymerized on a catalyst surface, and a
              second step in which the surface polymers are removed by a hydrogenation
              step.
     In Phase I, novel methane coupling catalysts will be synthesized
              and tested at the bench scale.  Tests will model the steps in a continuous
              process, and will have as an objective to show catalyst activity and
              selectivity comparable to that demonstrated by other research groups.  However,
              the form of the catalysts is to be substantially more economic if adapted to
              commercial scale processes for alkane production.
The principal commercial
              application of the novel catalyst to be developed is lower cost production of
              lower molecular weight alkanes using methane as a low cost feed stock. The
              catalyst and process will be amenable to methane conversion processes at both
              refineries and gas production sites.
