	This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              TextWise, LLC seeks to develop the theoretical basis for a legal datamining
              system.  The "DOCKET" system will be a natural language-based datamining tool
              that will automatically extract name entities such as people, places and
              organizations from electronic documents.  Extracted information will be
              presented in the form of concept-relation-concept triples and organized
              chronologically.  Relationships between extracted entities will be displayed
              graphically.  Links to the original documents will allow users to go directly
              to source documents of interest.  Specifically, in Phase I, TextWise will focus
              on a structural analysis of email messages as a text type.  The current near
              ubiquity of email as a form of intra- and inter-organizational communication
              has exacerbated the administrative challenge inherent in the legal discovery
              process-generating many more written documents than was previously the case. 
              Development of a system that performs an automatic analysis of email and
              similar textual material will result in substantial improvements in the quality
              and timeliness of pre-trial activities.  Information can thus also be extracted
              from optically scanned transcripts, depositions and interrogatories.
	The
              technology proffered by TextWise will contribute to litigation support services
              such as processing and visual summarization of relevant documents and
              stand-alone investigative tools such as a detective's electronic case notebook
              of persons, places and times.  The markets for DOCKET are law firms engaged in
              litigation and state and federal administrative agencies as well as other
              private firms whose activities affect life, liberty or property.
