Abstract    :
              9861100
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              determine the feasibility of using biotechnology to develop a virus-resistant
              shrimp for farming. Shrimp farming is the world's most valuable aquaculture
              industry and has suffered significant losses to viral disease. Recent advances
              in biotechnology have developed plants and animals with specific resistance to
              certain chemicals and pathogens. The commercial intent of this project is to
              develop a reproducible shrimp stock resistant to shrimp viral disease(s) for
              commercial shrimp farming.  This project is a collaboration between a
              commercial shrimp breeding company, High Health Aquaculture (HHA), and two
              university research groups, University of Hawaii (UH) and University of Arizona
              (UA).  HHA will manage the project and will produce the shrimp studied in the
              project. The UH group will provide transgenic technology based on their
              successful insect transgenic work. The UA group will provide shrimp virology
              expertise to the project.
     In 1997, world shrimp farming produced 690,000
              MT with crop value exceeding $4 billion. Nearly all of this production depended
              on the use of wild shrimp stocks which are unstable in supply, often
              contaminated with serious shrimp diseases and not adapted to modern production
              systems. Application of biotechnology to develop a shrimp stock with superior
              production performance represents a substantial commercial opportunity modeled
              on the rapid advances and commercialization of agricultural biotechnology.
