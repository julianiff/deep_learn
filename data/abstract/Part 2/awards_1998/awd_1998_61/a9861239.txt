Abstract    :
              9861239
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop a novel process for depositing and patterning contacts for use in
              ferroelectric thin film memory devices such as non-volatile and ultra-high
              density dynamic random access memories.  Materials such as Ru, Ir, and their
              oxides are used with PbZrlxTixO3 and Bal-xSrxTiO3 dielectric films owing to
              resultant improved device performance as well as their ability to protect
              underlying plugs from oxygen diffusion during processing.  The current lack of
              a convenient processing technology has limited the implementation of these
              electrode materials in devices.  In collaboration with another firm , TPL
              proposes to develop a process to pattern the desired film using standard
              techniques. This will be accomplished through incorporation of photo-sensitive
              ligands into a precursor solution which also contains the desired cation. This
              obviates the need for separate photoresist, thereby eliminating process steps,
              and enables easy, low-cost patterning of otherwise difficult to pattern
              materials. Objectives are to demonstrate that electrode films can be patterned
              to high resolution, to characterize fully the resultant electrode films and to
              assess the feasibility of incorporating the technology into the device
              integration process.
     Commercial applications for the proposed technology
              include non-volatile memories for smart cards, and high-density (gigabit) DRAMs
              for computer applications.
