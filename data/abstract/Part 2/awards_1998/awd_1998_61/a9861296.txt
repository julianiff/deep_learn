Abstract    :
              9861296
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              incorporate advanced radiation and chemistry models into a commercial
              computational fluid dynamics code for the purpose of developing a commercial
              simulation tool for optimizing the growth of compound III V Layers using
              Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE).  The code will be extensively tested
              and validated for industrial reactors.
     Heteroepitaxy of compound
              semiconductor materials on heterogeneous substrates is a vital technology for
              optoelectronics in the blue to ultra violet wavelength region and non linear
              optics in the infra red region and power devices and integrated sensor devices.
              The proposed model will be an enabling technology in demonstrating defect free
              heteroepitaxial growth by facilitating appropriate control of the MOVPE
              process.
