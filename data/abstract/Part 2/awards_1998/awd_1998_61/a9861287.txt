Abstract    :
              9861287
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Microwave Technologies Inc. will explore the development of a novel, compact,
              lightweight millimeter wave source providing radiation at 94 GHz and beyond. 
              Applications for the devices include high resolution radar, satellite
              communications, materials processing and waste remediation amongst others.  The
              compact amplifiers promised, which capitalize upon a novel synchronous
              interaction between a pencil electron beam and rotation wave fields, should be
              able to efficiently produce kW of electromagnetic radiation at 94 GHz and
              beyond, with an electronic efficiency as high as 50%.
