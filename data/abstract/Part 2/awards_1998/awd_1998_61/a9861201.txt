Abstract    :
              9861201
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              directed at the development of improved membranes for separations in the
              chemical process industry (CPI). Conventional membrane processes, despite their
              potential efficiency, cannot address many key CPI separations.  This is because
              membranes and modules cannot maintain selectivity when operating on
              multi-component feed streams nor withstand exposure to common feed-stream
              components and operating conditions.  The goal of this program is to develop a
              new hybrid polymeric material for membrane coatings that will retain high
              selectivity when operating on multi-component feed streams that would swell
              conventional materials and lead to a loss in selectivity. The coatings based on
              this new hybrid material will be applied to unique solvent-resistant and
              temperature-resistant hollow-fiber supports and used in high-efficiency
              modules.  In this Phase I program, feasibility will be demonstrated by
              developing coatings for two classes of industrially important organic/organic
              separations: aromatics from aliphatics and olefins from paraffins. The best
              coatings will be applied to solvent-resistant and temperature-resistant
              hollow-fiber supports and their performance demonstrated.
     The hybrid
              coating material could be used to prepare coatings for a broad range of
              organic/organic separations important in the CPI. Initially, two key
              separations will be examined: toluene from heptane and propylene from
              propane.
