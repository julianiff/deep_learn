Abstract    :
              9861395
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a
              novel synthesis route to develop monodispersed carbon nanotubes for high power
              energy storage applications.  High surface area carbons have been used as the
              electrode materials in recently developed electrochemical supercapacitors. 
              However, the energy densities achieved to date for electrochemical
              supercapacitors have fallen far short of the theoretically attained mark.  One
              major reason for this has been problems with utilization of the full capacity
              of the electrode materials, due to restriction of electrolyte solution
              accessible to much of the carbon surface.  It is also essential to reduce or
              eliminate particle to particle contact resistances among the carbon powders,
              which constitute the electrode for high performance charge discharge
              characteristics.  This program seeks to leap frog these technology barriers
              with an innovation that focuses on monodispersed carbon nanotubes as electrode
              materials for electrochemical supercapacitors.  During Phase I, Amsen will
              demonstrate the proof-of-concept of such a material.  Phase II will build on
              Phase I success, optimize, build prototypes and field test the technology in
              partnership with potential customers.  Phase III will commercialize the
              technology and anticipated spin off.
     High power density, reliable
              electrochemical supercapacitors would find a large market in military
              applications where portable and miniaturized electronics and actuators are
              being used.  Other applications include hybrid power systems for electric
              vehicles, memory backup systems for computers and electronic instruments,
              pulsed power source for lasers and camera flash equipment, and power source for
              portable consumer products.
