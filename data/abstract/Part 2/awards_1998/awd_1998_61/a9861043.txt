Abstract    :
              9861043
      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to
              develop suitable broad temperature antiferroelectric mixtures, at least one
              each of the thresholdless and tristate varieties, and to further refine
              material properties such as viscosity, pitch, and polarization. The proposers
              will synthesize new potentially antiferro-electric compounds and use them to
              formulate thresholdless and tristate antiferro-electric mixtures. Displaytech
              currently sells a high-resolution full color microdisplay for use in head
              mounted and projection displays. They also sell a color filter used in
              conjunction with the microdisplay to create the projection display. In the
              color filter, two bistable ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) displays must be
              stacked to give the three required states and thus provide three colors. Using
              a tristable antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC) in the device may make it
              possible to use a single cell to address all three states. The microdisplay
              uses time averaging of FLCs to provide gray scale but at less than the optimal
              number of levels. Using a thresholdless AFLC, which shows analogue gray scale
              with no hysteresis, large and temperature insensitive tilt angle, very fast
              switching, very large viewing angle, high contrast ratio, and minimal LC
              defects could increase the number of gray scale levels. 
      Potential
              commercial applications include color filters, high resolution full color
              displays, flat panel displays.
