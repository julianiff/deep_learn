Abstract    :
              9861376
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Decision Science Associates will develop a software risk management decision
              support system (DSS) that combines methods from software measurement, Bayesian
              statistics, and multiattribute utility theory.  The DSS will support a software
              manager's assessment and evaluation of risks and assist in making tradeoffs and
              decisions under uncertainty.  Technical objectives of Phase I are as follows: 
              identify the specific needs for decision support; develop a methodology for
              assessing risks, performing tradeoffs, evaluating alternatives, and making
              decisions in light of risks, uncertainties, and constraints; develop a plan for
              the decision support system to be developed in the next phase of the project;
              and demonstrate the feasibility of the Phase II system by developing a
              prototype.  These objectives will be pursued by conducting three tasks in Phase
              I:  (1) identification of important factors in a DSS, (2) development of a
              methodology, and (3) development of a computer prototype.  The resulting DSS
              will assist software managers in managing risk and other development problems
              in software projects.
     Potential applications exist for the product of the
              R&D of the second phase of the project in both commercial and federal
              government markets.  These include markets for the risk assessment process
              (service), the decision support system (product), and a technology transfer
              course (service).  Potential customers are in the federal government, its
              contractors, and commercial organizations.  Targeted companies are those that
              engage in substantial software product development, especially those that
              develop high-reliability or safety-critical systems.
