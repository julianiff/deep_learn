Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition of a phosphoimager
              system for molecular biology research and training.  The instrument will be
              housed in the Department of Biology at Indiana University-Purdue University at
              Indianapolis and will serve 5 major and two minor users in the department of
              Biology and two major users in the Department of Chemistry.  All major and
              minor users employ conventional autoradiography, fluorography and/or
              chemiluminescent detection with film on a routine basis.  However, these
              techniques are limited by the narrow linear response range of film and by the
              lengthy exposure times required for the fluorographic detection of weak energy
              isotopes such as 3H and 14C.  Phosphoimager analysis has several key advantages
              over autoradiography and fluorography.  First, phosphoimager screens have a
              linear response range of five orders of magnitude as opposed to only two for
              autoradiography.  Second, phosphoimager exposure times are generally only one
              tenth those required for autoradiography and fluorography.  This is especially
              advantageous for the detection of weak energy isotopes where fluorography
              exposure times of weeks or months are often required.  Third, the phosphoimager
              data can be quantified and imported into computer drawing programs for accurate
              quantitative analysis.  This system will complement existing molecular biology
              equipment in the laboratories of the major and minor users.  Moreover, the high
              degree of accuracy and efficiency afforded by phosphoimager analysis will
              improve the quality and quantity of molecular biology research and teaching
              performed by the investigators.
