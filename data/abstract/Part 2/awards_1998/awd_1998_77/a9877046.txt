A sensitive parity mixing measurement aimed at improving the
              precision on the value of the Weinberg angle at low momentum transfer and
              determinations of parity-violating nuclear anapole moments will be performed. 
              The experiments will exploit the predicted large parity mixing effects in
              atomic ytterbium.  Measurements of parity mixing for a series of isotopes will
              make it possible to essentially eliminate atomic theory uncertainty in
              extracting the Weinberg angle, which will be due to lack of knowledge of
              changes in nuclear neutron distributions from isotope to isotope.
