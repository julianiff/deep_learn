This project focuses on investigations of the use of entangled
              twin-photon beams as a nonclassical probe to obtain absorption and
              spectroscopic information from material media.  Measurements of the absorption
              cross section for twin photons will be carried out via photoemission
              experiments.  A phase-sensitive method that draws on the special relationship
              of the constituent entangled fields will allow the nonclassical component of
              the laser-matter interaction to be distinguished from the normal two-photon
              absorption.  The behavior of this nonclassical component will be examined as a
              function of the parameters of the entangled photon source.
