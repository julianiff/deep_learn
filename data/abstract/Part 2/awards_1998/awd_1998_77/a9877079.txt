Some of the strongest results obtained to date from
              the theoretical study of machine learning have used methods from discrete
              Fourier analysis.  This project seeks both to further apply these methods to
              answer significant open theoretical machine learning questions and to develop
              practical applications of several Fourier results.  Specifically, three tasks
              are planned.  (1) Extend results obtained under the PI's prior NSF-funded
              project to further improve the asymptotic run time of a key component of many
              Fourier-base algorithms. (2) Apply Fourier techniques to several interesting
              open problems, particularly those concerning the practically inspired problem
              of learning form data corrupted by various noise processes. (3) Implement and
              empirically evaluate a variety of Fourier-based algorithms, including those
              developed as part of the first two tasks, as well as others.  Applications
              considered include extracting rules from artificial neural networks and pruning
              decision trees.  In addition to anticipated advancements in our knowledge about
              machine learning, this project will contribute substantially to the research
              training of one or more undergraduate students at a largely undergraduate
              institution.
