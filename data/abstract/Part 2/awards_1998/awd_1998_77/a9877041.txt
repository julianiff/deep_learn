This experimental program combines two major foci, metrology
              in the form of ultraprecise mass comparison of individual trapped ions and atom
              and molecule interferometry with both thermal beams and Bose-Einstein
              condensates.  Combined, these two activities will allow a competitive
              determination of the fine structure constant and a benchmark measurement of the
              polarizability of alkalis.
