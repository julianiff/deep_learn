Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Bruce Ault of the University of Cincinnati and Janet Del
              Bene of Youngstown State University will study two classes of
              oxidation-reduction reactions using matrix-isolation spectroscopy.  The first
              class consists of high-valent transition metal oxo compounds, specifically
              chromyl chloride and methyltrioxorhenium, and the second involves organic
              peroxides, with hydrogen peroxide as a prototype.  The goals of this project
              include identification of key intermediates in the reaction pathways,
              spectroscopic and structural characterization of these intermediates,
              comparison of experimental results to high-level theoretical calculations, and
              deduction of the reaction mechanism for these reactions.  The reactive
              intermediates will be trapped and preserved in cryogenic inert matrices using a
              range of deposition techniques and different forms of energy input to initiate
              reaction.  Trapped species will be characterized by infrared, Raman, and
              visible/ultraviolet spectroscopy.

This project will aid in understanding the
              mechanisms of oxidation reactions that are at the heart of current research
              into catalysis.  Oxidation of organics constitutes one of the most important
              reactions in industry, but environmental waste needs to be decreased and raw
              materials to be conserved better.  Other areas impacted by this work include
              atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, waste water treatment, the production
              of fine chemicals, and synthetic organic methodology.
