This research project focuses on the investigation of the
              manipulation and control of fundamental quantum systems using methods of
              ultrafast spectroscopy.  The goal is to excite in a programmable way particular
              quantum states of atoms and molecules that have no classical counterpart, with
              particular attention given to nonclassical quantum states in the electronic,
              vibrational, and, eventually, center-of-mass coordinates of diatomic molecules.
               The quantum state of the molecules will be determined from the time- and
              frequency-resolved spectrum of spontaneous emission and via a self-referencing
              interferometric method.
