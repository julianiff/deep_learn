Abstract    :
              Novel techniques for the analysis of molecular weight distribution and
              polydispersity of polymeric materials are proposed.  The primary technique to
              be developed is time dependent static light scattering (TDSLS), which can be
              used to continuously monitor absolute weight average polymer mass and static
              polymer dimensions.  An auxiliary capillary viscometer in conjunction with the
              other detectors will provide the degree of monomer conversion.  The project
              aims at developing the instrumentation and techniques for monitoring the widest
              classes of step-growth and chain-growth reactions possible and to use the best
              available kinetic models to analyze the real-time data.  An appropriate set of
              representative reactions of these types will be chosen as model systems for
              developing the technique, applications, and associated analyses.  Real-time
              monitoring of polymerization reactions will potentially become a valuable tool
              in several contexts.  Synthetic chemists developing novel polymeric materials
              may be able to make an immediate determination of the effects of changing
              reaction conditions on polymeric materials may be able to make an immediate
              determination of the effects of changing reaction conditions on polymeric
              materials.  Rapid analyses of kinetic data will be possible, and real-time data
              from pilot scale operations may be used to optimize reaction conditions.
