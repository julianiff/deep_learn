Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to understand the inherent mechanical
              properties of full-density nanocrystalline metallic alloys. Continuing on with
              our recent progress in devloping procedures to consolidate mechanicallu milled
              nanophase metal and alloy powders into full-density samples, this work expands
              the investigation on basic properties to a number of elemental and two phase
              materials. To systematically investigate the intrinsic mechanical response,
              nanophase and ultrafine-grained metals and alloys will be prepared with special
              care taken to minimize porosity and particle debonding problems. Testing will
              be conducted in compression and tension. Fundamental deformation behavior and
              mechanisms will be studies. In particular, dislocation structure and behavior
              in single-and two-phase alloys, before and after deformation, inside grains and
              near interfaces (grain vs. phase boundaries), will be characterized and
              monitored over a range of grain sizes. The strain hardening and shear banding
              behavior and their dependence on composition and grain size will be
              investigated and compared with those found in conventional materials. The
              strengthening effects of interphase boundaries in multi-phase alloys will be
              characterized and modeled. Nanocrystalline metals and multi-phase alloys with a
              useful combination of mechanical properties will be demonstrated.***
