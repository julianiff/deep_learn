Physiological and Chemical Equipment for Studying Interactions between Marine
              Organisms
This award is to upgrade and enhance the biochemical and
              physiological facilities at the Shannon Point Marine Center.  The Shannon Point
              Marine Center of Western Washington University is part of the regional
              university system in the state of Washington.  Because of its location on the
              Puget Sound basin, the significance of the marine environment and its resources
              to the local region, an interest on the part of students, scientists at the
              Center have been actively involved in research on the local marine flora and
              fauna and in training students in marine research.  The research emphasis at
              the Center has shifted with the addition of new faculty to research that is
              more physiologically and biochemically based.  The emphasis on physiology and
              biochemistry requires further development of the facilities at the Shannon
              Point Marine Center, supported by this award with the purchase of a
              high-pressure liquid chromatograph and associate items of equipment.
