Abstract    :
              
The LeConte Glacier is a rapidly retreating temperate glacier in southeastern
              Alaska.  It has been stable for 33 years, but rapidly began to calve and
              retreat in December 1994.  It has receded one kilometer over nine-months and is
              calving into 270-meter deep water.  This proposal addresses many of the key
              issues and recommendations from the recent National Science Foundation
              (NSF)-sponsored tidewater glacier workshop.  Previous studies on similar
              glaciers have focused on processes at and near the terminus.  In this study,
              the Principal Investigators will measure and characterize a number of
              parameters along the entire length of the glacier and not just the snout or
              terminus.  The objectives are to:  1) understand what controls the stability of
              calving glaciers; 2) characterize glacier calving, especially submarine events;
              and 3) measure and characterize proglacial sedimentation to assess its effects
              on the dynamics and stability of calving glaciers.  Because the LeConte Glacier
              is rapidly calving, this is a "time-critical" study and it is important to
              begin collecting data while the glacier is in the initial stages of the calving
              retreat.  Repeated airborne elevation profiling, which has not been preciously
              used on glaciers, will be used to measure changes in surface geometry along the
              full length of the glacier on a seasonal and annual basis.
