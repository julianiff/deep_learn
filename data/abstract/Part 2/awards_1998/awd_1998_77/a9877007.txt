Abstract    :
              Bret Jackson of the University of Massachusetts is supported by the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue theoretical studies of
              molecule-surface interactions.  He will develop and implement techniques to
              efficiently describe the molecular coordinates and the strong coupling to the
              lattice in the dissociative adsorption of deuterium, methane, and nitrogen to
              metal surfaces.  Rigorous formulations of gas-metal scattering at finite
              temperature will be explored, as well as dissociation probability and dynamics
              of surface reactions, and the nature of sticking and trapping.

Studies of
              molecule-surface interactions form the basis of our understanding of such
              important processes as catalysis and semiconductor manufacture.  A full
              comparison between theory and detailed experiments is complicated by the
              coupling between the scattering molecule and the lattice.  This interaction is
              responsible for gas-solid energy transfer and sticking, as well as the
              temperature dependence of surface reactions and diffusion.  Time dependent
              quantum mechanical methods are being developed to accurately describe and
              predict these processes.
