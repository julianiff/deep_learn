Abstract    :
              Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence needed to
              describe a given property.  The languages are variants of first-order logic and
              their targets are finite, ordered structures.  There is a profound relationship
              between the traditional computational complexity of a problem and the
              descriptive complexity of the problem.  Indeed, all major complexity classes
              have been shown to have natural descriptive characterizations.

This research
              broadens the connections and extends the knowledge of complexity.  The
              following three areas are being pursued:  (1) Dynamic Complexity, (2) Model
              Checking and (3) Tradeoffs in Descriptive Complexity.
