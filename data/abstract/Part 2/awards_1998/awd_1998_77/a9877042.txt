This award to University of Miami will provide instrumentation
              for oceanographic research for use on four research vessels operated by the
              university's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and by the
              Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a deep-profiling acoustic doppler current profiler, a new
              conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument, a scintillation counter, and
              bottles for sampling sea water for physical and chemical oceanographic
              research. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists conduct studies throughout the world ocean in 1999 and future
              years.
