ABSTRACT

Professor Gieseker will investigate deformations of
              infinite dimensional
integrable systems such as the KdV hierarchy. The KdV
              hierarchy is a
sequence of mutually commuting differential operators in one
              variable. The
object of this grant is to produce deformations of this and
              similar
hierarchies which preserve complete integrability.   Professor
              Gieseker has
produced such a deformation of the KdV hierarchy and will seek to
              produce
many more deformations of KdV and also to find deformations of
              other
infinite dimensional completely integrable systems. 

Certain
              important equations of nonlinear science are completely integrable,
which
              roughly means that there are a lot of conserved quantities of these
equations.
                These equations are applicable in a wide variety of practical
situations,
              for instance in understanding laser optics. Professor Gieseker
proposes to
              apply the methods of algebraic geometry to find discretizations
of this type
              of equation so that the discretizations are integrable.  This
means finding
              algorithms to solve these equations on the computer so that
the solutions
              computed on the computer have the same type of conserved
quantities as the
              original equations.   Professor Gieseker will continue to
investigate his
              discretization of KdV, as well as develop new
discretizations of other
              infinite dimensional integrable systems.
