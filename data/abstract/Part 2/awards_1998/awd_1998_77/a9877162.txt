Abstract    :
              Dr. Peter Armentrout of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies of gas phase organometallic
              ion chemistry and chemical dynamics, utilizing the techniques of flowing
              afterglow ion production and guided ion beam mass spectrometry.   Detailed
              kinetic and thermodynamic data will be obtained by accurate measurement of
              absolute reaction probabilities at thermal and hyperthermal energies. 
              Experiments will focus on reactions of atomic and partially-ligated metal ions
              with a range of neutral reagents, emphasizing heavier (second and third row)
              transition metals.   The characterization of the changing effects of spin-orbit
              coupling on the chemistry as transition metal centers get heavier is of
              particular interest.  Studies of the effects of sequential ligations on the
              thermochemistry and reactivity of metal centers will be performed as well.  The
              outcomes from this work are expected to permit better correlations between the
              detailed information available from gas phase studies and condensed-phase
              organometallic and catalytic reactions where coordinatively unsaturated
              transition metal centers are known to be key intermediates.  

Learning about
              trends in the energy that is evolved or required to carry out chemical
              reactions is important for understanding and predicting a wide range of
              chemical behavior.  The thermochemical database that is established with the
              outcomes of this research has useful impacts in chemical catalysis and
              organometallic chemistry in condensed phases, with broad industrial
              implications.
