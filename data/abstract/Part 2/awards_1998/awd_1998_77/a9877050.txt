Abstract    :
              Nancy Makri is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical research on path integral and
              semiclassical approaches to the dynamics of large chemical systems.   Makri
              will use an influence functional approach to study the quantum dynamics of a
              system in a complex polyatomic environment.  She will exploit the structure of
              the influence functional that allows pairing of the forward and reverse time
              evolution operators.  This leads to expressions amenable to Monte Carlo
              integration.  Two procedures will be investigated: 1) a locally quadratic,
              instantaneous normal mode expansion of the solvent potential; and 2) a rigorous
              semiclassical forward-backward initial value representation of the influence
              functional.  Makri plans to conduct benchmark calculations and applications to
              the dynamics of energy transfer in clusters and fluids.

The large majority
              of reactions that are of interest to chemists occur in condensed phase systems
              in the presence of solvent.  The theoretical models for treating such complex
              systems are still in the early stage of development.  Makri is developing new
              theoretical approaches for dealing with solvated chemical systems undergoing
              chemical reactions where quantum effects are important.
