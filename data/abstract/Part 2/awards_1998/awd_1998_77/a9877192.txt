Abstract    :
              David Micha of the University of Florida is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to pursue density matrix approaches to first
              principle quantum dynamics of molecular interactions.  New techniques will
              combine time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory with eikonal methods for nuclear
              motion.  Computational algorithms will be developed to calculate time-evolution
              of electronic state populations, spin-orbit recoupling, and state-to-state
              cross sections.  Applications include femtosecond dynamics and spectra of
              electronic rearrangement in gas-phase collisions and at solid surfaces. 
              

This theory aims to provide new insight, concepts, and predictive
              computational tools to deal with collision-induced and photoinduced electronic
              transitions in molecules. Its computational implementation generates electronic
              potential energies, their couplings, and transition dipoles for studies of
              dynamical phenomena.  It will aid in the interpretation of recent novel
              experiments involving femtosecond chemistry, stimulated emission of transient
              species, and spectroscopy of solvated species.
