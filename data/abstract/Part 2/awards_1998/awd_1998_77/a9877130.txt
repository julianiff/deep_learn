The collapse and subsequent
              explosion of stars in supernova events play a fundamental role in producing and
              distributing throughout the Universe most of the elements heavier than hydrogen
              and helium.  This project involves a theoretical investigation of the supernova
              core collapse process.  One- two- and three-dimensional approaches are being
              taken towards constructing an extensive grid of numerical models for the
              collapse phase of the supernova event.  The goal of this effort is to determine
              the relative effects of spherical symmetry, neutrino transport, axial symmetry
              and convection on the models and their agreement with the observed
              characteristics of supernova events.  The one- and two-dimensional simulations
              utilize existing neutrino transport code.  Additional 3-D code is being
              developed to investigate the effects of convection on the hydrodynamic
              properties of supernova.
