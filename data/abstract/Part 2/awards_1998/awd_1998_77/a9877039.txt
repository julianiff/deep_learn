Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR
              spectrometer for the Instrumentation facilities of the Division of Chemistry
              and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology.  The major
              purpose of this high field instrument will be for the determination of the
              structures of complex biological molecules of biosynthetic, semisynthetic and
              synthetic origin.  The research activities of several groups in the Division
              will benefit greatly from the new spectrometer and in many cases, entirely new
              projects will be made possible by the new instrument.  The 600 MHz spectrometer
              has the resolution and sensitivity needed to determine structures of complexes
              in the 5 to 30 kD range.  Research for which the instrument is required
              includes the study of metal-DNA complexes; protein- and peptide-DNA complexes;
              the structure of DNA intercalators; studies of the hyperthermostability of
              rubredoxin from P. furiosus; structure and dynamics of novel proteins;
              artificial proteins; ion channel proteins; and electron transfer reactions in
              wild-type and mutant netalloproteins.  The availability of this instrument will
              have a major impact on both the research and training activities of the
              Division.
