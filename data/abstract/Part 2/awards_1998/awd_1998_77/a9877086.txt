Abstract    :
              John Light at the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to pursue fundamental studies in quantum
              chemical dynamics.  He will continue the development of the discrete variable
              representation used in theoretical spectroscopy.  He will also focus on 
              accurate hybrid quantum/classical descriptions for larger systems where full
              quantum calculations are not possible.  Applications include the interaction
              and dynamics of water clusters, and Eley-Rideal reactions of hydrogen on
              diamond surfaces.

Theoretical chemistry attempts to understand and predict
              the behavior of real systems, both microscopic and macroscopic, based on
              knowledge of the fundamental interactions at the atomic and molecular level. 
              The fundamental processes of interest include catalytic reactions in the gas
              phase and at surfaces, absorption and emission of radiation, and
              photodissociation.  Theoretical and algorithmic advances are required in order
              to assess quantum effects in inelastic and reactive scattering processes in
              systems larger than a few atoms.  Quantitative understanding of such processes
              can lead, for example, to control of combustion and synthesis of novel
              materials.
