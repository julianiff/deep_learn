Abstract    :
              This project, carried out by Professor J. Sweedler of the University of
              Illinois, and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
              develop the analytical instrumentation and methodology capable of identifying
              and quantifying neuropeptides from single cells, and those neuropeptides
              involved in cellular processes.  The model system Aplysia californica is used
              as a test bed to demonstrate these new and improved capabilities, and to
              elucidate the fundamental aspects of peptidergic transmission.  Matrix-assisted
              laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry is used to image intact ganglion
              sections with molecular specificity and subcellular resolution.  Capillary
              electrophoretic methods are used to analyze sub-nanoliter volumes of  samples
              derived from these systems.  Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is used
              to monitor peptide releases from a single cell under precisely controlled
              stimulation conditions.

Professor Sweedler will use advanced analytical
              methods to identify and quantify the peptides released from individual nerve
              cells on stimulation, and to image the distribution of these compounds within
              the cell itself.  Signal transmission between cells depends on the release and
              uptake of these small peptides.  Careful study of the model system will
              provide, for the first time, a complete understanding of the fundamentals of
              nerve impulse transmission.  This example can then be used as a starting point
              for the study of nerve impulse transmission in more complex organisms.
