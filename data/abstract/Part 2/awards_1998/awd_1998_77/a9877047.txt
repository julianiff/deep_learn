Abstract    :
              The investigator studies the topology and combinatorics
of simplicial
              complexes.  This includes work on the spectra
of discrete Laplace operators
              analogous to Laplace operators on 
Riemannian manifolds, questions relating
              the topology of the
complexes to commutative algebra, and the topology of
              certain
partially ordered sets of subdivisions of convex polytopes.

  The
              investigator studies mathematical objects called
simplicial complexes.  These
              objects arise when one wants
to take everyday objects or shapes, such as
              automobile parts
or biological molecules, and represent them in a
              computer.
Many important problems revolve around understanding or
              tailoring
the shape of such objects, and the simplicial complexes give
a
              concrete way to do this.  Part of the investigator's work
may be thought of as
              placing constraints on the shapes of these
objects, if we know how many pieces
              are used to build them.
