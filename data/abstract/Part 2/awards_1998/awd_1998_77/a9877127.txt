Learning Probability Models for Surface Appearance and Shape by Minimax
              Entropy Principle

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing
              award.  The research in this project is aimed at three important problems in
              visual learning.  1). Studying a   mathematical theory for visual learning. 2).
              Learning realistic probability models for textures, object shapes, clutter, and
              texton flows, which are essential constructing components of natural scenes.
              3). Developing fast algorithms for model inference and model verification.
              Central to the research is the  minimax entropy learning theory,  proposed by
              the PI, the co-PI, and Mumford in 1997. The minimax entropy learning theory  is
              capable of exploring the intrinsic structures (or regularities) underlying the
              observed imagery and patterns. The outcomes of this learning theory are
              statistical models of the visual patterns for textures, object shapes, clutter,
              and texton flows. The learned models can be used in the Bayesian framework as
              likelihood functions and prior probabilities, which are essential for the
              success of Bayesian image analysis paradigm in applications such as image
              segmentation, perceptual organization, and object recognition. The PI and Co-PI
              have achieved good preliminary results, and together, they form an effective
              interdisciplinary team to conduct the research.
