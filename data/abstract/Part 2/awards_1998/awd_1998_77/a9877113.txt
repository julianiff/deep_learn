Abstract    :
              
 

The proposal is to investigate lasing processes in polycrystalline or
              nano-crystalline ZnO  and GaN particle semiconductors that the group discovered
              recently. It is postulated that formation of closed loops and photon
              locallization  are possible mechanisms for lasing. Proposed research activities
              include: (1) near-field microscopic measurement of the intensity distribution,
              (2) numerical simulation of lightwave propagation and cavity formation in
              random media, and (3) fabrication of optoelectronic devices such as waveguides
              and lasers with semiconductor polycrystalline and nano-particle films on
              various substrates. If successful, it may have a major impact on materials
              research of nano-particle films and on understanding of the physics of
              nano-structures that may lead to novel device applications.
