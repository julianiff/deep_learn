Abstract    :
              Project Abstract - 9877083
This award will enable the purchase of a fluorescent
              scanner and three thermocyclers, which will be used to generate genotypes for
              plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria based on DNA polymorphisms.  These
              instruments will double the genotyping capacity at Indiana University, thus
              greatly facilitating the many research projects that rely on this kind of
              molecular data.  The instruments will be easily accessible to all users, as
              they will be housed in a central facility managed by the Indiana Molecular
              Biology Institute, which also will be responsible for the supervision and
              maintenance of the equipment.
