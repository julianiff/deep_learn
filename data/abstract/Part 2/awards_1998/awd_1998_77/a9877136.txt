Abstract    :
                   This project is to investigate the deposition and performance of a
              superlattice coating for cutting tools to determine the effectiveness of the
              multilayer coating for dry machining. The intent is to develop a method for
              custom designing, evaluating, and manufacturing coatings with desirable
              properties for specific dry machining applications. The research plan includes
              modeling and experimental testing of the coating process for TiN/Si3N4, as well
              as the physical characterization of the resulting coatings. The fatigue and
              fracture behavior of the nano-layer coatings will be modeled to study the
              effects of the temperature field established in the cutting process upon the
              life prediction. Dry machining experiments will be conducted to determine the
              actual temperature field for validation of the cutting system modeling and the
              life performance of the nano-coated tools. 
     The principal investigators
              will bring expertise in materials science and engineering, mechanical
              engineering, and engineering mechanics to address the complex issues of the
              coating development and performance. The interdisciplinary project includes
              both an educational component for graduate and undergraduate curricula in three
              departments as well as an outreach component for high school students.
