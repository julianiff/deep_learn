              cooperation with the University of Miami for technical support as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              equipment to be acquired includes a boat to support diving operations, a
              gyroscope, four air tuggers, a portable winch and two instrumented blocks for
