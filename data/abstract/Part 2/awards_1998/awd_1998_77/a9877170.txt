Abstract    :
              Despite the tremendous rise of visual representations in human interaction with
              computers, most of the underlying computation is still sentential - based on
              traditional string languages. This goal of this project is to enrich the
              interactive computational environment through the addition of spatially dense,
              non-sentential representations.  The PI and his students will develop a
              theoretical basis and use it to explore new forms, behaviors, interactions,
              algorithms and problems, new interaction paradigms built on those, and the
              construction of new sorts of applications.  The PI's BITPICT paradigm will
              serve as a vehicle for some of this work, which is expected to have application
              to a wide variety of domains including interactive image analysis, robot motion
              planning, interactive weather or physics simulation, new analysis techniques
              for 2D simulation results, less-crisp representations for early-stage design,
              and new sorts of games.  If successful, the principal broad impact of this work
              will be the expansion of the range and variety of interactions that humans will
              have with computers, in work and play settings, which in turn may possibly
              encourage us to think about new types of problems.  More speculatively, the
              development of the underlying graphical computation theory could enable new
              sorts of theories of how human spatial processing might work, and also provide
              a new understanding of fundamental computational aspects of space and spatial
              representations, as well as limits on spatial
              abstraction.
