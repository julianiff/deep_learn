The aim of this project is to investigate further some
              problems
originating from my work on (a) parabolic and elliptic measure,
(b)
              quasiconformal mappings, and (c) regularity of PDE's. Under
(a) I would like
              to know when the Dirichlet Problem has a solution
for certain parabolic and
              elliptic PDE's with drag term. Given that
the Dirichlet problem for these 
              PDE's has a solution, I would like 
to know when the corresponding measures
              possess basic properties such 
as a doubling property. As for (b), I would
              like to construct more 
examples of  domains which are quasiconformal to a
              sphere and for 
which harmonic measure and n - 1 dimensional Hausdorff measure
              on 
the boundary are equal. Finally under (c) I would like to know if 
the
              techniques used to prove reverse Holder inequalities for solutions 
to systems
              modeled on for the parabolic p Laplacian can be used on
other PDE's such as
              the Navier Stokes equation. 

Many physical problems can be described in the
              language of
partial differential equations (PDE's). Well known examples of
              such
equations arising in the 19 th century are Laplace's equation,
the heat
              equation, the wave equation, Maxwell's equations, and
the Navier- Stokes'
              equation. Without question knowledge derived
from a theoretical study of these
              equations led to many fundamental 
technological advances during the 19 th and
              20 th centuries.
Three questions often asked by those who study PDE's is (a)
              does 
there exist a solution, (b) is it unique and (c) does it possess 
nice
              properites or is it regular?  As for (a) and (b) one is often 
concerned with
              so called  boundary values or boundary conditions for 
a solution in the
              domain of existence. So called overdetermined boundary
value problems have no
              solution whereas such classical problems
as the Dirichlet and Neumann problems
              have solutions if the
boundary of the given domain  and the boundary
              conditions are 
sufficiently nice (smooth). My work is concerned with how
              much
one can relax these assumptions and still get meaningful theorems. 
For
              example, during the last quarter century,  many classical
theorems for the
              Laplacian in smooth domains have been shown to 
hold in a class of rough
              domains called Lipschitz or sawtooth
domains.  My coauthors and I have
              obtained the analogue of 
Lipschitz domains for the heat equation.  Another
              avenue of 
investigation has been to consider questions (a)-(c) in a half
              
space for rough parabolic PDE's.  My work  provides a model for 
certain
              free boundary problems such as ice melting (the Stefan problem).
