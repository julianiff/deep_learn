The continuing availability of adequate water depends
              critically on our ability to manage water resources systems under a variable
              and uncertain climate.  Semi-arid regions are in particular jeopardy as they
              are experiencing rapid population growth and economic development.  They are
              highly sensitive to increasing anthropogenic pressures, variations in climate,
              and disruptions associated with long-term climate change.  The current system
              lacks an effective mechanism for rapidly moving the state of scientific
              knowledge into widespread usage by the public agencies and supporting private
              firms responsible for managing our water resources.  The Center is bridging
              this gap by: 1) monitoring management problems for critical hydrologic issues,
              2) identifying issues that can be effectively addressed in a timely fashion, 3)
              coordinating and integrating needed studies over multiple disciplines and
              institutions, 4) developing ripening technologies and ideas, and 5) focusing
              and committing resources to expedite viable technological and educational
              interventions.

The Center's scientific focus is on innovative research on 1)
              spatial and temporal properties of hydrologic variables, 2) processes
              controlling water and chemical balances in catchments, 3) functioning of
              riparian systems, 4) integrated modeling of catchment-scale processes, and 5)
              promoting researcher-user partnerships across the breadth of water resources
              management through technology transfer as an integral part of the day-to-day
              operation of the Center.  Educational initiatives have a high profile in the
              Center and contribute to sustainability by bringing water resources issues to
              the forefront of science education in K-16 and promoting hydrologic literacy
              among the public.  The Center is educating a new generation of water resources
              professionals in the interdisciplinary perspective and technological skills
              required for practicing sustainable water resources management.
