              Abstract

This project will develop charge-coupled devices for astronomical
              imaging based on fully depleted 300 micrometer n-type silicon substrates using
              using a process developed by the Principal Investigator and his group.  These
              devices will offer a number of advantages for astronomy including enhanced
              quantum efficiency in the blue and near-infrared spectral regions, absence of
              spectral "fringing," and lower cost.
