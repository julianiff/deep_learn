This project represents an activity on the boundary between
              atomic physics and semiconductor physics.  The similarities and differences
              between free excitons and atoms will be exploited to study the radiative
              coupling between quantum wells.  The field pattern and consequently the overlap
              of the radiation field with the quantum wells will be controlled by changing
              the spacing between quantum wells, thereby altering all of the properties of
              the composite system polaritons.  Specific attention will be paid to a search
              for Bose-Einstein condensation for some of the polariton modes.
