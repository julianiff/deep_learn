Abstract    :
              Andrew Marcus is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental studies of the
              properties of complex materials confined to spatially restricted geometries
              such as polymer, colloid or biomolecular membrane systems in thin films or
              membrane form.  Marcus will pursue three interrelated lines of investigation:
              1) the study of structure and dynamics of these systems; 2) the development of
              highly sensitive instrumental techniques specialized in the detection of
              optical signals from volumes that are very small or narrow; and 3) the
              extension of these techniques towards the study of the properties of
              biologically relevant systems such as membrane bound proteins.  Marcus'
              teaching plan at the undergraduate level will broaden the content of honors
              freshman chemistry by developing multidisciplinary themes and using cognitive
              learning processes that actively engage students through participation.   At
              the graduate level he will broaden the graduate education and research
              activities through involvement in multidisciplinary research projects.

The
              complexity of supermolecular systems holds promise to a rich array of behaviors
              useful in the area of nanotechnology.  At the present time, however, there is
              insufficient understanding of the properties of liquids, simple or complex, in
              confined spaces.  Marcus' research will attempt to extend this understanding
              and shed light on the properties of such systems.
