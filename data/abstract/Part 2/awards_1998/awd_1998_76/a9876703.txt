Fesen, Robert

This grant supports an observational
              study of the near infrared spectra of supernovae.  This region has not yet been
              exploited in studies of supernovae and the potential for significant discovery
              exists.  The spectroscopic features in the near infrared may provide valuable
              diagnostics for the radioactive yields of heavy elements, helium abundance and
              molecule formation processes that are less accessible in the visible.  During
              the three years of the project an extensive map of the near infrared spectra
              will be constructed for as many SN as possible.  Along with collaborators who
              will provide a theoretical basis for interpreting the spectra, this project
              will identify the most useful spectroscopic tracers for the physical conditions
              in the supernova environment.
