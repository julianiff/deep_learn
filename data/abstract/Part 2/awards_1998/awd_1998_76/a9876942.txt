REU:
               Undergraduate Research in Advanced Imaging and Intelligent Systems

These
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports nine
              students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. 
              In addition, two students are supported by the institution, as part of the
              machine intelligence including image recognition, fuzzy logic and pattern
              recognition, machine vision, and related areas.  There are good recruitment
              plans and the plan is to have at least 25% of the participants from members of
              underrepresented groups.

Students are chosen on basis of their interests,
              grades, computer skills and other demonstrated abilities.  The research
              activities are generally applied rather than theoretical and most projects are
              directed toward real-world applications.  Significant institutional support is
              provided.
