Abstract    :
              The College of William and Mary in Virginia will initiate a ten-week program of
              physics research for junior-level undergraduates.  Research topics include:
              atomic, including atom-atom, atom ion, and atom surface scattering, laser
              physics and laser atom interactions, surface physics, condensed matter physics,
              with a variety of techniques, nuclear and particle physics, polymer physics,
              plasma physics, non-linear dynamics, physical oceanography, and
              astrophysics/cosmology.  Some common activities are planned with the REU
              program of the Hampton University Physics Department.
