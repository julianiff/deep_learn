Cepheid variable stars are
              primary distance indicators in astronomy.  The current calibration of the
              distance scale set by the Cepheid period-luminosity relation is uncertain by
              about 10%.  Radial velocity measurements combined with new data from long
              baseline optical and infrared interferometers will provide linear and angular
              diameters from which stellar distances can be directly estimated.  In this
              project time- and wavelength-dependent brightness distributions for a sample of
              Cepheid variables will be computed using dynamical non-LTE atmosphere models
              that incorporate both plane-parallel and spherical geometry.  The results of
              these models will be compared to observed Cepheid radial velocities measured
              and integrated in a manner consistent with the angular size data collected by
              the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer.  Appropriate transformations between
              the radial and pulsational velocities will be applied using a selection of
              spectral lines of corresponding line-forming regions. The goal of this program
              is to improve the absolute precision of the Cepheid distance scale by roughly a
              factor of two.
