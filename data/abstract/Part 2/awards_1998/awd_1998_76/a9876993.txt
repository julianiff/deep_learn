This project focuses on the study of the interaction of
              negative ions with photons and static electric fields.  Both types of
              interaction will be investigated within the framework of photodetachment.  For
              the interactions with photons, emphasis will be placed on studying the
              rescattering of the electron wavefunction for s-wave and p-wave detachment. 
              For the interactions with static electric fields, emphasis will be placed on
              the effects of these fields on transient shape and Feshbach resonances.   The
              research will highlight extensive involvement of students at this undergraduate
              institution.
