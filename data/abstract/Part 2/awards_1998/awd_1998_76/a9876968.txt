This research consists of a series of experiments that will
              use coherent control methods to manipulate the generation of short pulse laser
              radiation and electronic states in atoms.  The project will focus on three
              areas: (a) the use of pulse shaping to implement a novel pulse generation
              technique based on continuum generation in noble gases; (b) the study of the
              strong response coherent control method of adiabatic passage via closely spaced
              Rydberg states and continua; and (c) the implementation of a novel version of
              the coherent control method of interfering pathways in the strong response
              regime.
