Title: Warm Season Land Surface-Climate Interactions in
              the U.S. Midwest

The proposed collaborative research  (Carleton/Penn State
              Univ. PA, Travis/Univ. Wisconsin Whitewater WI, and Arnold/Ball State Univ. IN)
              aims to determine the role of land surface conditions in the contemporary
              (1981-1994) warm season climate (April through September). The geographical
              region to be studied is the humid lowland region of the Midwest US centered on
              the Corn Belt. The PIs will determine the association between land covers
              parameters  (such as vegetation, evapotranspiration, surface and soil moisture)
              and connective cloudiness across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Data
              from GOES and NOAA AVHRR using McIDAS and a combination of statistical
              techniques including fractal analysis, will be utilized. Conventional
              meteorological data and published land cover data will help to corroborate the
              satellite data, and also assist in determination of land surface-climate
              interactions for sub-areas and time periods characterized by contrasting
              vegetation status, surface soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions such as
              humidity and wind. The work is important because it will enhance our
              understanding of the role of land surface conditions in seasonal climate of the
              corn belt region of the US.
