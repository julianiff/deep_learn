This awards supports the theoretical study of several problems
              involving the self-assembly of complex materials, with particular emphasis on
              biological lipids and diblock copolymers.  This project will focus on five
              topics: (1) a self-consistent model for the dependence of a lamellar-like phase
              and an inverted hexagonal phase of DNA and cationic lipid complexes on lipid
              concentrations; (2) a study of two proposed mechanisms to make non-viral DNA
              transfection more efficient; (3) the lamellar to hexagonal transition in a
              model mixture of lamellar and non-lamellar forming lipids with a model study of
              the intermediates between the two phases; (4)  a related study of these
              intermediates using mixed real-reciprocal space methods; and, (5) a study of
              the surface phases of diblock copolymers as a function of copolymer
              architecture.

This awards supports the theoretical study of several
              problems involving the self-assembly of complex materials, with particular
              emphasis on biological lipids and diblock copolymers.  The study of biological
              lipids has application to the study of non-viral DNA transfection-a technique
              for delivering DNA to cells by enclosing it in liposomes, but with variable
              efficiency for reasons that are not well understood.  A second aspect of the
              project will focus on understanding how technologically important surface
              phases in diblock compolymers vary as a function of the copolymer architecture.
