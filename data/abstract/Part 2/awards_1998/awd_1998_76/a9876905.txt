Abstract    :
              Professor Eric Stuve's research deals with the electrocatalytic mechanism of
              methanol oxidation in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). In particular, the
              objective of this study is to understand the kinetics, reaction intermediates,
              catalyst modifiers, and poisoning mechanism of noble metal electrodes. The
              long-term prospect and broader impact is the development of improved electrodes
              and economically feasible DMFC. The parallel path mechanism of methanol
              oxidation will be studied in a dual electrochemical cell and in a combined
              ultrahigh vacuum-electrochemical cell system. The metal surfaces will consist
              of single crystalline and polycrystalline Pt modified with Ru, Os, and Ir.
              Characterization of surface structure and chemistry will be performed with
              Auger, LEED, and thermal desorption of CO. The chemical characterization will
              also include differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy of volatile
              reaction products. The project targets the training of undergraduate and
              graduate fuel cell engineers.
