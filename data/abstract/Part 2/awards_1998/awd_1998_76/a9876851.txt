Abstract    :
              The Science Museum of Minnesota will relocate and rehouse its paleontology
              collections, which will be moving into the museum's new million facility
              beginning in the second half of 1999.  This project will support the
              acquisition of new compactor carriages and shelves, cabinets, and associated
              packing materials as well as a full-time curatorial assistant to help with the
              project.

The paleontology collections are among the museum's most notable,
              and contain several nationally and internationally important specimens and
              series.  They include over 20,000 catalogued specimens with catalogued and
              accessioned lots and uncatalogued items that total approximately 400,000 items.
               Highlights of the paleontology collection include a first-class suite of
              fossil reptiles-including Jurassic and Cretaceous dinosaurs, primary types of
              taxa of crocodiles, champsosaurs, and chelonians.  Other collections of note
              are Green River fish, Oligocene mammals, representative Minnesota invertebrates
              from the Paleozoic, and Quaternary collections from Minnesota.

In the new
              facility, central collections storage will increase from the current 3,350sq.
              ft. to 11,340 sq. ft.  The new storage vault will have state-of-the-art
              environmental controls and will be located immediately adjacent to curatorial
              offices, study labs (with digital photography installations, preparation
              spaces, and fully equipped work stations and microscopes).  Most of the
              facilities of the Research and Collections Division will be housed on one floor
              in the core of the building, with direct access by secured elevator to
              a
loading dock and immediate access to exhibit halls.
