The Whole Earth Telescope (WET)
              project coordinates over a dozen observatories around the world in
              observational campaigns to observe white dwarf stars.  During a given
              international campaign, target stars are observed around-the-clock for several
              weeks.  From these continuous records of photometric variability, many
              different frequencies of oscillation can be detected.  Each is related directly
              to a given depth, opacity, density, and ionization state in the stellar
              interior.  Analogous to earthquake studies of the Earth's interior,
              asteroseismology provides one of the few observational verifications of
              theoretical models of stellar interiors.  Detailed analysis of the frequencies
              observed yields high precision cooling rates, composition and masses that are
              unachievable by any other means. This technique is being extended include hot
              subdwarfs, d Scuti variables, Ap stars and other unstable objects in late
              stages of evolution.  The operational center of WET is being moved from Texas
              to Iowa.
