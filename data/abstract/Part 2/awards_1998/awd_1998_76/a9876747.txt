Abstract    :
              
Approximately 80,000 specimens of mosses from the contiguous United States
              remain to be cataloged after completion of tasks under previous support.  The
              moss specimens from the contiguous United States held in the NYBG bryophyte
              herbarium represent the largest single source of raw data for the Flora of
              North America is a project undertaken by the community of systematic botanists.
               The goal is to provide authoritative, up-to-date information on the names,
              relationships, characteristics, and distributions of the 20,000 species of
              plants (vascular plants and bryophytes) that grow outside of cultivation in
              North America North of Mexico.  The Bryophyte Organizing Center for the Flora
              North America project is housed at NYBG and is headed by the P.I.  The flora
              will treat 315 genera of mosses, 120 genera of liverworts (1800 species total).
              Eighty-five different authors have agreed to contribute treatments to the
              bryophyte volume.  To date nenety treatments have been submitted; 21 have been
              reviewed and revised and will go live as provisionally published at the FNA
              website by the end of 1998.

This project will support the completion  of the
              Bryophyte Catalog and make it available electronically for use in FNA and other
              projects.  The project will be completed by 31 December 2000, well in advance
              of the deadline for the Flora of North America bryophyte volumes (scheduled for
              2004).
