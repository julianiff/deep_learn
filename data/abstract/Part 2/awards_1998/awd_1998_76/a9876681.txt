Abstract    :
              The NDSU Collaborative for Mathematics and Science Teacher Preparation
              (NDSU-CoMSTeP) is a three-year, single-institution, CETP Track I project
              designed to increase the number of middle and senior high school science and
              mathematics teachers prepared in North Dakota.  The undergraduate students at
              North Dakota State University (NDSU) and Turtle Mountain Community College
              (TMCC) are the target recruitment populations.  The project goals are to:  (1)
              at least double the number of science and mathematics teachers prepared by the
              two institutions, (2) significantly increase the number of Native American
              science and mathematics teachers, and (3) develop a model for increasing the
              number and cultural diversity of secondary science and mathematics teachers
              prepared in rural regions.  The project involves three interventions: (1)
              proactive recruitment of students from first and second year university
              /college science and mathematics courses and high school seniors into teaching
              career tracks, (2) undergraduate student involvement in science/mathematics
              teaching interest groups designed to support and enrich the students' desires
              to enter teaching, and (3) the reform of teaching in undergraduate science and
              mathematics courses in order to improve the quality of learning for all, but
              particularly for those students in the science and mathematics teacher
              preparation programs.
