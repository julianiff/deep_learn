Abstract    :
              
This project  addresses the synthesis of InxGa1-xN quantum dots(QDs) via a
              three step electrochemical process.  Indium and gallium are co-deposited from
              aqueous solutions to form nanoparticles of InxGa1-x having a known, average
              composition followed by electrochemical oxidation of InxGa1-x nanoparticles to
              form (InxGa1-x)203.  The third step involves displacement of the oxide from
              (InxGa1-x)203 with nitride derived from a reactive source such as ammonia,
              hydrazine, or hydrazoic acid to form InxGa1-xN QDs and byproducts (gaseous
              water and hydrogen).  Steps 1 and 2 occur at room temperature, and conditions
              for step 3 will be sought permitting the displacement process to occur
              efficiently at temperatures below 400C.  The approach includes synthesis, as
              outlined above, and structural characterization and optical characterization of
              InxGa1-xN QDs.  Synthesis parameters will be studied to achieve greater
              understanding of the processes involved, and to control the particle size
              mono-dispersity.  Optical spectroscopy will be used to guide the synthesis of
              InxGa1-xN QDs which are luminescent at the bandedge.  The PL and absorption
              properties of these QDs will then be correlated with the indium mole fraction
              determined using neutron activation analysis.

The project addresses
              basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of
              electronic/photonic devices.  The basic knowledge and understanding gained from
              the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform-ance of
              advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a
              basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials
              combinations.  A variety of fundamental issues are to be addressed in these
              investigations, and the proposed experiments will also develop a
              technologically important emissive material which is capable of spanning a
              large part of the visible spectrum.  An important feature of the program is the
              integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area.
