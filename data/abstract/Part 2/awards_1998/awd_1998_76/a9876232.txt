This is a CAREER grant which integrates theoretical research in
              materials and condensed matter physics with a variety of  education activities.
               The research focuses on two goals: (1) new algorithms (genetic algorithms) for
              structural energetics of materials and (2) novel composite carbon nanotube
              structures which exploit interactions with other materials to create new
              physical systems.  The education thrust will involve a number of activities at
              various levels.  These include active research pages on the internet (with
              integrated public feedback and discussion) and support of a virtual children's
              museum.
