Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Nathaniel Finney in the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry at the University of California at San Diego.   The goal of the
              research is to discover and develop fluorescent chemosensors that can be used
              to measure low level concentrations of heavy metal ions and small organic
              molecules in water.   The devices depend on changes in emission intensities or
              wavelengths which result from complexation of the analyte to the fluorescent
              molecule.   Combinatorial methods will be used to identify sensors for further
              development, initially emphasizing the detection and measurement of Hg++.  
              Fluorescence-based measurement of concentrations of mercury ions, as well as
              other heavy metal ions and small organic molecules in water, promise to be much
              more rapid and lower cost than conventional methods, with applications in both
              environmental protection and medicine.   The educational activities to be
              carried out under this grant include: 1) development of a new laboratory course
              in combinatorial chemistry to go with a lecture course the PI has already
              developed, 2) an annual UCSD Combinatorial Chemistry Symposium, and 3) a summer
              seminar series on the History of Chemistry.   Graduate students working with
              the PI will learn valuable skills useful to the growing biotech industry in the
              San Diego area.
