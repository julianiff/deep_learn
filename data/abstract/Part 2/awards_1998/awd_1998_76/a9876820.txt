Abstract    :
              A "collisionless" plasma is a fully ionized gas in which
electromagnetic forces
              dominate collisional effects.  The motion of a
high temperature, low density
              collisionless plasma is described by
the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear
              system of partial
differential equations.  The major question to be addressed
              is this:
are there shocks in a collisionless plasma?  That is, could
              a
singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as
              time
progresses?  Additionally, "induction heating" will be studied.  In
this
              area one investigates how a conductive material is heated by
using
              electromagnetic waves.  Microwave heating is a
              particular
example.

"Plasmas" are often called the fourth state of matter
              (after solids,
liquids and gases).  Plasmas account for a huge proportion of
              the
material in the universe.  Famous examples of plasmas include the
solar
              wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae and comet tails.  The
motion of a
              plasma is described by a number of complicated equations
dictated by physics. 
              The mathematician's goal is to show that these
equations have solutions, at
              least under certain conditions.  This is
the main thrust of the proposal.  A
              completely different application
to be studied is called "induction heating." 
              Here one tries to
determine how various materials can be heated by passing
              
electromagnetic waves through them.  The microwave heating of food 
is a
              particular example.
