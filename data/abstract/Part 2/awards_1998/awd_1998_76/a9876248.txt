This proposal investigates a new class of processors and
              their
associated compilers, Tiger processors, which TIghtly couple
              a
GEneral-purpose processor with a Reconfigurable function unit (RFU).
The
              RFU can be configured, at run-time, to implement a function as a
hardware
              circuit.  Tiger processors offer the flexibility of a
general-purpose
              microprocessor with the performance of a custom
circuit.

Tiger processors
              offer high performance and efficiency because they
contain an RFU, which, when
              needed, can be configured to implement
hardware matched to any individual
              application.  Tiger processors can
realize an application's parallelism on all
              levels: MIMD, SIMD,
instruction-level, pipeline, and bit-level.

The two
              requirements to realizing the potential of these processors,
investigated in
              this proposal, are (1) developing robust compilers
which quickly produce
              efficient executables from any high-level
programming language, and (2)
              investigating the proper interface
between the RFU and the general-purpose
              processor.

The objective of this research is to allow programs to
              obtain
performance approaching that of custom hardware from a
              general-purpose
device.  Tiger processors will both increase performance and
              reduce
the cost of systems because there will be no need to augment
              systems
with custom hardware and its associated design overhead.
