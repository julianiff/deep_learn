Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to determine how the anterior of a
              vertebrate
embryo becomes correctly positioned. The extreme anterior ectoderm
              in the frog
Xenopus forms the cement gland, a mucus-secreting organ that is an
              excellent
positional indicator. The focus of this project is to define
              ectodermal genes
that regulate cement gland determination. One transcription
              factor expressed
in the cement gland that is key for cement gland formation is
              the homeobox
gene otx2. Ectopically expressed otx2 activates ectopic cement
              gland
development, while ablation of otx2 activity using a dominant negative
              protein
prevents cement gland formation. A hormone-inducible otx2 protein,
              otx2GR,
activates the cement gland marker XAG1, however only with ongoing
              protein
synthesis, suggesting that otx2 activates expression of downstream
              genes which
in turn activate XAG1 expression. In this proposal, genes
              activated by otx2GR
that may directly activate XAG1 expression will be
              isolated using a
subtractive cloning strategy. In order to further analyze
              cement gland
positioning, dissection of the XAG1 promoter has been carried
              out. A 200bp
XAG1 fragment directs expression of a reporter to the cement
              gland. This
fragment is also responsive to otx2GR, although it contains no
              otx2 binding
sites. Further analysis of the XAG1 promoter will be performed to
              define
promoter elements necessary for cement gland formation. Factors that
              interact
with XAG1 regulatory sequences will be identified and characterized.
              Since the
cement gland is an indicator of normal head development, and since
              genes and
developmental strategies are evolutionarily conserved, what we learn
              in
Xenopus is likely to have relevance for understanding normal and
              abnormal
development of human embryos.
