Abstract    :
              This project is a new approach to system-on-a-chip design, called
              deconstruction.  The approach starts with an existing prefabricated,
              parameterized, reference design in silicon, composed of hundreds of
              Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, and then deconstructs it into the desired
              system by setting parameters.  In contrast, the current approach is to
              construct a desired system by combining IP and then generating silicon.  This
              approach has serious verification limitations.  The techniques being developed
              focus on making deconstructed systems competitive with constructed systems in
              terms of design metrics like power, performance and size.  The emphasis is on
              two issues relating to flexibility in reference designs: (1) Formalizing the
              notion of parameterized reference designs, consisting of a sound parameter
              classification scheme, and a precise method of specifying such parameters, and
              (2) Developing models and algorithms for parameter optimization, requiring
              system-level models of power and performance metrics from which metric values
              can be rapidly computed.  Such optimization is being achieved by developing
              techniques based on cost ranges, rather than single cost values, to evaluate
              candidate solutions.
