The research in this project is aimed at understanding the
              interaction of high intensity, ultrashort pulse laser light with complex atoms.
               The goals are to: (a) study multiphoton ionization beyond the single active
              electron model; (b) study very high order above threshold ionization in one and
              two electron atoms; and (c) develop a unified picture of photoelectron spectra
              and ion charge states.  The measurements will focus on the analysis of ion
              yields, electron energy distributions, and angular distributions of
              photoelectrons in order to establish a unifying theory of high field processes
              in atoms.
