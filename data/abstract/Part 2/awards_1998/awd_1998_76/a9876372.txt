This grant is for support of students to attend the 1998
              Gaseous Electronics Conference in Maui, Hawaii, October 19-23, 1998.  This
              conference is the major source of cross fertilization between the atomic,
              molecular, and optical physics community, the low-energy plasma physics
              community and industry.
