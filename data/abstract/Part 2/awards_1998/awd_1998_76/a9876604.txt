This planning
              propoal will develop the preliminary work and cement the partnerships necessary
              to develop a fully-fleshed proposal to devise an ontology for geographic
              knowledge.  The proposed Federal partners would be the US Coast Guard and the
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The ontology proposed would
              encode entities such as shorelines, tide tables, and other domain objects.
