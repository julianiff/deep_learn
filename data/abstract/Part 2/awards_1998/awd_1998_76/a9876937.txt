Washington State University establishes a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) Site with a focus on characterization of advanced
              materials.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide for a ten-week
              summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              predominantly undergraduate institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky
              Mountain regions.

Students are involved in materials research that includes
              thin film growth, mechanical properties measurements, and solid freeform
              fabrication of composites. Undergraduate students work in teams to determine
              the correlation between processing parameters and resulting material structure,
              as well as the effect of structure on the properties of the materials studied. 
              In addition, students participate in a forty-hour instrumentation course,
              weekly seminars and social activities.  Providing students at both the lower
              and upper undergraduate level with exposure to advanced processing and
              characterization techniques motivates talented undergraduates to enter or
              remain in the field of materials research.
