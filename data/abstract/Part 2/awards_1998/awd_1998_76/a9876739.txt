Digital Government: The CARDGIS Energy Data
              Collection

This proposal will create an Energy Data Collection to support
              real-time integrated viewing, interaction, and manipulation of the Department
              of Energy's gasoline-related data collection, through a partnership with the
              Energy Information Agency.  The proposed research will cover automated ontology
              development and distributed information integration across data held by
              multiple Federal agencies.  The computer science department of Columbia
              University will be a partner in the research.  Partnerships have also been
              agreed to with the Bureau of the Census, the National Center for Health
              Statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
