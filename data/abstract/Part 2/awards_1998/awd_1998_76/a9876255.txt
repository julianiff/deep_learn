Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal consists of a program of high pressure experiments aimed at
              understanding key aspects of mantle melting and a curriculum development
              project that will use the MELTS algorithm to introduce undergraduate geology,
              geophysics, and geological engineering majors to forward modeling as a research
              and educational tool.  The experiments include investigation of whether partial
              melts of garnet pyroxenite interconnect at low melt fraction, improved
              determinations of the temperature-pressure location of the solidus for dry
              peridotite and for peridotite with H2O contained within amphibole and within
              nominally anhydrous silicates, and a study of the relationship between water
              fugacity and dissolved H2O in water-undersaturated mafic magmas by measuring
              the H content of olivine equilibrated with silicate liquids at pressures up to
              5 GPa.  All three studies seek to improve our understanding of the geodynamic
              and geochemical consequences of melting beneath oceanic ridges and beneath
              island arcs, and will improve understanding of the effects of variable mantle
              composition on melting processes.  The education portion of the plan involves
              development of a tutorial and laboratory exercises for an upper division course
              in petrology and using the petrologic phase equilibria program, MELTS.  The
              exercises will constitute a two week unit of laboratories at UM and wil
              emphasize forward modeling and hypothesis testing as scientific tools as well
              as aid in a deeper understanding of petrologic topics discussed in lectures. 
              Additionally, tutorials and resource-sharing will aid dissemination of these
              curricular developments to faculty teaching petrology at neighboring colleges
              and universities and to the geoscience community at large.
