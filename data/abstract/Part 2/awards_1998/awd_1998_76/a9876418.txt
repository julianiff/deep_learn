Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications involve
              telecollaboration, enhanced utilization of remote resources, and real-time
              interactions with remote experimental and computational resources. Scientific
              Collaborating institutions include University of California, Santa Cruz, Johns
              Hopkins University, University of Arizona, NOAO, Oberlin College, NASA-Lewis
              Research Center, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and Fermilab.
