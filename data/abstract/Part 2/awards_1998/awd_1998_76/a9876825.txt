Abstract    :
              This project will support the rehousing of the entire dry bird specimen
              collection in the Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Research Center,
              University of Kansas.  The collection requires rehousing for two reasons:

1.
               Collections crowding - Collections growth through systematic research has
              resulted in severe crowding  of specimens in cases, with no new space available
              in the collections area.  Moreover, physical constraints of the collections
              area makes it unsuitable for installation of mobile compactor units.

2. 
              Collections conservation- Almost all of the cases are more than 30 years old,
              and many have degraded to the point that they no longer provide adequate
              protection for specimen material against pest infestations and environmental
              fluctuations.

The solution is to rehouse the collection in larger, taller,
              modern cases.  This solution is far less costly than installation of mobile
              compactor units, and will provide more space and better
              protection.

Approximately 20% more space would be available for specimen
              storage, enough to solve critical space problems and to provide about 5 years
              of normal collections expansion.

The new cases, already designed and tested
              as prototypes, would provide state-of-the-art protection for this world-class
              ornithological collection.
