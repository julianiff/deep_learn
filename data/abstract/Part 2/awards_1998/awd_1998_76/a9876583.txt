The objective is to
              develop the frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) technique for assessment
              of particle size and particle interaction parameters in concentrated
              suspensions of 10% to 50% by volume.  This inverse problem analysis is based
              upon the light diffusion in turbid, multiple scattering samples.   The
              technique consists in launching intensity-modulated light and monitoring the
              phase-delay and amplitude demodulation as it propagates through the medium. 
              The measurement can provide either particle size distribution or particle
              interactions.  On-line measurement capabilities will be developed.  Particle
              interactions for polymer induced depletion enhancement, electrostatic
              repulsion, and steric stabilization of colloidal particles will be measured. 
              
If successful, the research will provide a technique for on-line measurement
              of particle size distribution and particle interactions in dense suspensions of
              interest in paints, inks, polymer composites and other colloid mixture
              applications.
