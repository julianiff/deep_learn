Abstract    :
              	Semiclassical methods are applied to find and interpret large-scale structures
              in the absorption spectrum of atoms in electric and magnetic fields.  These
              structures are associated with periodic or closed orbits.  The research
              requires analyzing bifurcations in classical, semiclassical and quantum
              mechanics.
