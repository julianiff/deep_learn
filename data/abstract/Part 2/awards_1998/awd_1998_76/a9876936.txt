Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in
              Demographic Research at Western Washington University.  Ten undergraduates will
              participate in "Applied Demographic Research on Migration" for eight weeks. 
              The students, supervised by a project team of professional demographers, will
              focus their research efforts on the study of migration profiles and analytical
              models.  A variety of data files, including the Public Use Microdata Sample,
              the 1990 STFs, IPUMS, and the Cumulative General Social Survey will serve as
              primary data sources for the research experiences.  

This award contributes
              to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into
              careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
