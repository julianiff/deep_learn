Digital Government: Citizen Access to Government Statistical
              Data

This proposal will conduct research to improve the location/retrieval,
              reading, navigation and manipulation of tabular statistical data from Federal
              agencies.  These data cover many different domains (e.g., health, labor,
              transportation), of interest to professionals in the field and to citizens. 
              This work will be accomplished through collaboration with the Bureau of Labor
              Statistics, the Energy Information Agency, the National Center for Health
              Statistics and the Bureau of Census.  In addition to the Federal agencies, the
              partnership includes researchers from the University of California at Berkeley,
              Syracuse University, the University of Maryland and Textwise, a commercial
              company.
