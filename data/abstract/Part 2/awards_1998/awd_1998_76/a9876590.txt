Abstract    :
              The research will explore the fundamental of controlling fluid flow in
              convective systems.  Experiments will be carried out on surface tension driven
              (Marangoni) convection where the driving forces, thermally induced surface
              tension gradients confined to an interface, can be probed and altered for both
              laminar and chaotic convection.  The driving will be determined via infrared
              imaging of the interfacial temperature field and altered direclty via nearly
              simultaneous, multipoint heating by an infrared laser scanner.  Dynamics in
              three areas will be investigated: 1) wavenumber selection mechanism of
              spatially periodic patterns; 2) defect dynamics in disordered convective flow;
              3) the role of unstable periodic orbits in spatiotemporal chaos.
