The
              principal investigator will study various isoperimetric
problems in Euclidean
              space and more general Riemannian
manifolds. He will work on Aubin's
              conjecture, that the Euclidean
isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in a
              simply connected
space of nonpositive curvature, at least for small volumes.
              More
general isoperimetric problems in Euclidean space involve
clusters of
              several given volumes, crystalline energies dependent
on direction, and
              immiscible fluids, for which interface cost
depends on the fluids separated.
              He will work on the Double
Bubble Conjecture for general volumes and in higher
              dimensions. A
distinguishing feature of many of these problems is
              the
appearance of singularities.

Isoperimetric problems consider the cost
              of enclosing volume:
soap bubbles enclosing volumes of air, crystalline
              arrangements
of molecules in materials, the interplay between area and
              volume
in the curvature of the universe.  Singularities often play a
critical
              role: soap films meeting in threes, structural defects
in materials, black
              holes in the universe. Fundamental questions
remain open. The Double Bubble
              Conjecture, for example, says that
the familiar double soap bubble is the
              least-area way to enclose
and separate two given volumes of air. The recent
              computer proof
for the case of equal volumes by Hass and Schlafly can be
              traced
back to work by Morgan's NSF undergraduate research Geometry
Group,
              which will continue to work on the general problem. Morgan
gives some forty
              talks a year. To popular audiences he likes to
explain that the way to
              understand the geometry of the universe
is first to understand the geometry of
              soap bubbles. He has a
Math Chat TV show and column, both available at the
              Mathematical
Association of America website at http://www.maa.org, and
              is
currently making final preparations for the publication of a
popular Math
              Chat Book.
