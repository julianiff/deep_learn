Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of
              ANIR's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides
              partial
support for two years for OC-3 connections to the vBNS for
              three
institutions--University of Nevada Reno, University of Nevada Las
              Vegas,
and Desert Research Institute. Research applications that will utilize
              the
new connections include projects in theoretical physics,
              nanomaterials
research, distributed adaptive systems, Western Regional Climate
              Center,
Unified Climate Access Network, and other work in the
              engineering,
physical, atmospheric, biological, and geosciences.
              Collaborating
institutions include NCSA, LANL, LBNL, Sandia, Cornell
              University, numerous
western universities, and other national facilities.
