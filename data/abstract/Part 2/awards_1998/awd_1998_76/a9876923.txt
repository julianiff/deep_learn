Abstract    :
              The current generation of high-performance computers are hierachical
              multiprocessor machines. These computers can be an effective technology for
              solving challenging problems. However, their complexity leads to an array of
              tradeoffs in writing programs that hinders timely implementation. In
              particular, the built-in assumptions of a flat hierarchy in most existing
              parallel programming models makes it difficult to express efficient
              hierarchical algorithms needed on these machines. This project will compare two
              approaches to programming hierarchical parallel machines: an explicitly
              hierarchical model that is aware of the machine's structure, and a model that
              abstracts the communication to hide the hierarchy. Both models will be
              investigated by extending the KeLP2.0 framework, which provides support for
              masking communication latency (either hierarchical or not) by pipelining. This
              supports the design of application-specific overlap techniques. The
              investigators will carry out detailed performance studies of several
              applications, including Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows.
              The results of these will be incorporated in alternative implementation
              policies within the KeLP runtime system. The KeLP system will be made available
              to interested researchers as a possible platform for further investigation in
              hierarchical parallel programmig.
