This project is to develop and measure the operational
              characteristics of a continuous-wave optical two-photon laser and use it as an
              experimental quantum optics tool to investigate light-matter interactions under
              extreme conditions.  This new type of quantum oscillator is expected to operate
              in the highly nonlinear regime, and the fluctuations in the number of photons
              emitted by the laser are predicted to display interesting and potentially
              useful quantum correlations.
