Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications involve
              biomedical optical tomography, multicast networks, parallelizing algorithms to
              biomedical optical tomography, multicast networks, parallelizing algorithms to
              estimate network performance, remote observations in Radio Astronomy;
              simulation of particle systems, protein sequence and structural diversity, and
              diagnostic telepathology. Collaborating institutions include San Diego
              Supercomputer Center, University of Massachusetts, Purdue University, Johns
              Hopkins University, Dartmouth College, University of Maine, University of
