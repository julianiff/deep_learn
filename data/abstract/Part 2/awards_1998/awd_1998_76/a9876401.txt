Abstract    :
              9876401 Hayes The objective of this project is to study the water quality
              impacts associated with removing contaminated sediments using a conventional
              hydraulic cutterhead dredge through extensive field data collection in
              conjunction with the ALCOA Point Comfort/Lavaca Bay Superfund Treatability
              Study. Specific objectives of the research are to: (1) gather water quality
              data from near the dredgehead and in the water column (25m to 500m) during
              conventional hydraulic cutterhead dredging operations under conditions
              representative of other remedial sites, (2) gather these same data under a
              range of dredge operating conditions, (3) evaluate the range of water quality
              impacts associated with this type of dredging operation, (4) use the near-field
              data to verify and refine the model proposed by Hayes (1998) that relates the
              rate of sediment resuspension to the dredge characteristics and operating
              parameters, (5) conduct column settling tests on the sediments and attempt to
              verify the far-field suspended sediment transport model proposed by Je (1998)
              and (6) evaluate the potential for recontamination by calculating the amount of
              sediment and mercury transported away from the site based upon the water
              quality data collected during the dredging operation and compare that to
              measured sediment deposition and mercury concentrations at specified locations.
              The National Research Council estimates that 14 to 28 million cubic yards of
              contaminated sediments are dredged annually from U.S. ports, harbors and
              waterways to maintain established navigation depths.  Larger volumes of
              contaminated sediments are known to exist in non-navigable areas and designated
              superfund sites.  While many of these sediments can remain in place, remedial
              actions are necessary where contaminants are finding their way into the food
              chain.  However, concern over excessive water quality impacts during removal
              hampers cleanup actions.  The results of this study will provide additional
              knowledge of the effects of contaminated sediments removal operations on the
              quality of the surrounding and downstream aquatic environments.
