Abstract

Many genomic scale projects rely on the
              efficient and accurate identification of clones from an ordered library. The
              most direct way of identifying clones is through hybridization to high density
              filters. To increase the throughput many laboratories have explored the
              automation of this process, but they have been hampered by the lack of suitable
              software for the process. The Clemson University Genomics Institute is a major
              supplier of high density filters to laboratories throughout the world. The
              development of a software package to analyze these filters will be carried out
              to greatly facilitate their use. Researchers in laboratories which receive the
              filters will also receive the software package in order to allow the
              implementation of automated clone
              identification.
