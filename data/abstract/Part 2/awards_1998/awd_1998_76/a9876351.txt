This grant
              will address an important problem area for the US Bureau of the Census, and
              through them, the various Federal agencies who commission the Bureau to conduct
              statistical survey, i.e., the specification and creation of complex survey
              instruments.  At present Census is using a very old proprietary system which
              occupies nearly 100 Census staff.  The PI will use commercially-available
              software as an infrastructure upon which will be created a research prototype
              of a modern Web/relational database system, using modern software engineering
              techniques, to allow graphically-specific surveys with built-in error-checking
              and administration.
