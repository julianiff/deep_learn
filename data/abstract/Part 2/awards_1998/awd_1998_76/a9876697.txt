              Information Acquisition, Exchange and Dissemination

This collaborative
              proposal between RAND and the US Environmental Protection Agency would explore
              the potential for use of networked digital technologies in the regulatory
              agency arena, in particular the requirements, both insitutional and technical,
              for electronic collection, exchange, and dissemination of regulatory data.  The
              regulatory program under study is the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
              System under the Clean Water Act.  Under examination will be the key
              stakeholders and their roles and relationships, the types ofhe heterogeneous
              data to be exchanged among stakeholders, the technologies for carrying out
              electronic acquisition, integration, sharing and dissemination of such
              information, and the criteria, legal and other, for satisfying the regulatory
              compliance.
