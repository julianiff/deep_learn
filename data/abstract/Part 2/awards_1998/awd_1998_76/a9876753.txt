Title: Warm Season
              Land Surface-Climate Interactions in the U.S. Midwest

The proposed
              collaborative research  (Carleton/Penn State Univ. PA, Travis/Univ. Wisconsin
              Whitewater WI, and Arnold/Ball State Univ. IN) aims to determine the role of
              land surface conditions in the contemporary (1981-1994) warm season climate
              (April through September). The geographical region to be studied is the humid
              lowland region of the Midwest US centered on the Corn Belt. The PIs will
              determine the association between land covers parameters  (such as vegetation,
              evapotranspiration, surface and soil moisture) and connective cloudiness across
              a range of spatial and temporal scales. Data from GOES and NOAA AVHRR using
              McIDAS and a combination of statistical techniques including fractal analysis,
              will be utilized. Conventional meteorological data and published land cover
              data will help to corroborate the satellite data, and also assist in
              determination of land surface-climate interactions for sub-areas and time
              periods characterized by contrasting vegetation status, surface soil moisture,
              and atmospheric conditions such as humidity and wind. The work is important
              because it will enhance our understanding of the role of land surface
              conditions in seasonal climate of the corn belt region of the US.
