Air entrainment by a plunging jet is experienced in a wide range of
              natural (e.g., a waterfall) and technological (e.g., a chemical plant mixing
              vessel) flows.  This flow has not, however, received attention as a basic flow
              module for such technological or natural flows.

The proposed study is one
              that takes clever advantage of existing equipment and experimental techniques
              to investigate the basic features of this class of flow fields.  It is expected
              that the study will yield bench mark results.
