Abstract    :
              This research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              focuses on the further study of semiconductor/liquid interfaces and organic
              photoconductor/liquid interfaces.  Professor Bard and his students at the
              University of Texas at Austin will extend their studies to include new group
              III-V nitride semiconductor materials.  In this project atomic force microscopy
              and scanning electrochemical microscopy will be used with electrochemical
              measurements.   As the efficiency of photoelectrochemical processes occurring
              at these interfaces improves possible water splitting reactions, photocatalytic
              waste treatment processes, and the development of new memory devices will be
              pursued.

There is a need to more efficiently couple the conversion of solar
              energy with electron transfer reactions driven at solid/liquid interfaces. 
              Professor Bard and his students at the University of Texas at Austin have
              pioneered studies of semiconductor/liquid and organic photoconductor/liquid
              interfaces for these purposes.  A family of new semiconductor materials will be
              studied in this work with the aim to improve the efficiency of these
              photoelectro-chemical reactions.  Among the practical advances envisaged for
              this work is improved splitting of water and more efficient
              photoelectrochemical waste treatment processes.  New memory devices will also
              be developed in this work.
