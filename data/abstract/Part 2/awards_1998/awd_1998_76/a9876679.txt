This award to an undergraduate institution supports a
              two-component research project.  In one part laser-cooled and magneto-optically
              trapped metastable krypton atoms are used to make precise measurements of the
              natural lifetimes of metastable states in different krypton isotopes.  In the
              second part novel properties of dielectric-barrier discharges will be examined.
               These research efforts will be accompanied by an educational component that
              includes the development of a new physics course based on the theme of clocks
              and time keeping.
