This proposal requests funding to
              support ten (10) undergraduate students per year, for five 
consecutive years,
              to attend a ten-week summer research site in the area of environmentally benign
              
chemical processes and products.  This REU site will complement a research
              and education initiative 
launched recently by SUN'Y-Buffalo's Department of
              Chemical Engineering, in which high-impact 
developments from chemical
              engineering science will be channeled into a significant regional and
              
national advancement of waste minimization for pollution prevention.  The
              proposed program encompasses recruitment of traditionally underrepresented
              student talent, novel research experience in 
environmental technology, a
              lecture series on ethics in research, interdisciplinary interaction with
              
regional waste management and environmental remediation activities, and
              significant industrial 
cooperation.  The program is strengthened by dedicated
              advising and assessment of students' careers in 
research.  The Department of
              Chemical Engineering will provide 10% matching support in the form of 
travel
              monies for the research experience participants.
