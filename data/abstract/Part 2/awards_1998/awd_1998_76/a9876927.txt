This project focuses on extending the cooling and trapping of
              atoms to include species beyond the alkali atoms and hydrogen.  The technique
              used to accomplish this is based on buffer-gas loading of the trap, which
              relies on collisions as opposed to light to achieve the initial cooling.  The
              proposal describes a continuation of studies that have already begun, and for
              which some success has been demonstrated.  One goal of the experiment is to
              look for possible Bose condensation in dilute fermionic systems.
