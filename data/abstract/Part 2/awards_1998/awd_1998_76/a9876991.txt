This project involves the study of species entrained in large,
              ultracold helium clusters.  Neutral ground state atoms with s-wave ground
              states will be prepared within the clusters by the photodissociation of
              embedded diatomic molecules.  By studying the photodissociation fragments as
              they migrate toward and emerge from the surface, information will be obtained
              about the transport of neutral species through a droplet of a quantum fluid and
              about dissociation processes in such a medium.  Additional spectroscopic
              studies and analysis of the phenomenon of cluster aggregation will also be
              carried out.  The research is supported by the Divisions of Physics and
              Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
