Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the evolution
              of soot particles in turbulent nonpremixed flames, specifically how soot
              precursor particles are formed from high-molecular-weight compounds.  The
              aggregation kinetics of super-large aggregates in heavily sooting flames is
              explored.  The detailed nanostructure of soot particles is analyzed to help
              identify the source of the soot.  Two fuels are used:  methane for studies of
              soot precursor particles and acetylene for studies of high concentrations and
              large aggregates.  Experimental techniques include angular light
              scattering/extinction and thermophoretic sampling.  The effect of turbulence on
              the soot field is evaluated by analysis of the scattered signal.  Measurements
              of temperature, velocity, and radiative heat loss are also made.

A broad
              range of educational activities is included consisting of development of
              courses and curricula, active participation of undergraduates in research,
              encouragement of members of underrepresented groups, involvement of industrial
              practice, and bringing computer technology and the interest to the classroom
              and instructional laboratory.
