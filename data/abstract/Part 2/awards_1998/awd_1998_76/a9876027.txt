The aim of this project is to further an understanding of
              the relationships between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions,
              molecular order, and the properties of solid-state organic materials by
              focusing on the structure-order-property relationships in systems to include
              amphiphilic perylenebis(dicarboximide)s in the lyotropic phase and in thin
              films.  Optical properties such as transmittance, polarizing efficiency,
              dichroic ratio and fluorescence emission of thin films will be studied using
              techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy and polarization microscopy.  In
              addition, the highly tailored surfaces obtained by self-assembled monolayers of
              alkanethiolates on gold will be used as models of interfaces to study the
              dependence of molecular orientation and order on the interfacial properties of
              substrates.  Educational goals include providing students with research
              opportunities in organic materials, and implementing changes in the existing
              curriculum by revising the content of undergraduate courses to introduce solid
              state organic materials chemistry issues, offering a graduate Special Topics
              course in solid-state organic chemistry, mentoring graduate students
              (especially minorities and women), and collaborating with junior college
              faculty to implement materials chemistry topics into the general chemistry
              curriculum.

New classes of organic materials that are highly relevant to
              developing technologies are rapidly emerging.  These include fullerenes and
              nanotubes, organic superconductors, photoconducting materials, liquid crystals
              and organic light emitting diode materials.  Training students through a well
              integrated teaching and research program prepares them to compete effectively
              in an important job market by teaching them to play a leading role in the
              development and application of solid state organic materials.
