Abstract    :
              9876586

There are three main areas of proposed activity.  The first one is
              developing the technique based on quasiderivatives of solutions of Ito's 
              equations and applying it for processes considered up to the first exit time
              from domains.  The second area is investigating  smoothness of solutions of
              SPDEs arising in filtering problems and the theory of measure--valued processes
              in order to be able to guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations
              to their solutions.  The third area is estimating the rate of  convergence of
              numerical approximations for degenerate controlled diffusion processes.

The
              project relates to investigations of probabilistic behavior of certain objects.
               Part 1 is aimed at a better understanding of averaged quantities related to
              optimal control of random processes.  Part 2 aims at problems directly related
              to many practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance
              computing in eliminating "friendly fire."  It is also vital in dealing with
              problems like evolution of bacteria population which may be important in
              biotechnology. Part 3 deals with practical ways of solving problems of optimal
              control of random processes which arise for instance in finance.
