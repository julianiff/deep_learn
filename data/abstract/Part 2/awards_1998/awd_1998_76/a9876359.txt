The biennial International Symposium on Pollutant
              Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO) is the only international conference
              which focuses exclusively on the effects of environmental contaminants on
              marine organisms.  Topics covered include  mechanisms of metabolism,
              biotransformation, and detoxication of environmental contaminants and the
              assessment of their biochemical, physiological, pathological, immunological,
              genetic, and reproductive effects. The objective of this, the tenth symposium
              (PRIMO 10), is to bring together scientists actively engaged in research
              related to these  subjects and stimulate the exchange of information and ideas.
              The PRIMO l0 will be held 25-29 April, 1999, at the College of William and Mary
              in Williamsburg, Virginia. This award will help defray the meeting expenses for
              graduate students presenting their research.
