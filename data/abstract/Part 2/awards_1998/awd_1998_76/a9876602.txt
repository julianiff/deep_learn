During each of five years, this project will involve 56
              science and mathematics teachers in an intensive three-week summer workshop. 
              In the workshop they will experience and model all steps in the process by
              which students go from a broad topic of interest to a highly defined research
              problem.  The following academic year the teachers will attend five all-day
              Saturday sessions or a one-week follow-up session for out of state sites. 
              These sessions emphasize the acquisition of key skills by teachers needed to
              implement the high school research course.  The resulting high school research
              course is a three-year program of study.  In year one the student identifies a
              research problem, recruits a scientist mentor, and locates a research site. 
              Year two is devoted to doing research during the academic year and summer. 
              Year three continues the research work as well as emphasizing the communication
              of results in local, regional, and national symposia and student competitions. 
              It is anticipated that after five years 400 of some 800 public high schools and
              30 private schools in NY State will have established a Science Research course.
               To test the transportability of the model 80 teachers will be selected from
              outside NY State.  These teachers will come from California, Florida,
              Mississippi, Missouri, and West Virginia.  They will attend workshops in their
              state.  Participating teachers will receive three graduate credits in the
              Department of Educational Theory at SUNY-Albany.
