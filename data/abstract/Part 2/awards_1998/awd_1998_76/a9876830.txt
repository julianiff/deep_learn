Abstract    :
              
The collection of amphibians and reptiles at theTexas Memorial Museum, with
              more than 58,000 catalogued specimens, is one of the largest collections in the
              southwestern United States, and also has significant holdings from Central and
              South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Although the first 51,000 records
              were computerized prior to 1990, these records were never verified against the
              original catalogs and field notes.  Therefore, significant errors exist that
              diminish the usefulness of the computerized data.  Access to collections is
              limited by the absence of a network to support Internet queries and cataloguing
              operations.

The two goals of this project are: 1) to establish a data
              network that will support collections operations and provide Internet access to
              collections information; and 2) to bring the quality of information to the same
              level for all specimen records through data verification and inventory of
              specimens.  

The specific needs to be met by this project are to:

o
              Implement client-server version of cataloguing software to permit multiple
              users and remote cataloguing, and to make these data accessible via the
              Internet.

o Verify computerized data for the catalogued specimens against
              original data, and in doing so normalize Locality-Collection-Specimen
              relations.

o Inventory catalogued specimens by making new container labels.
