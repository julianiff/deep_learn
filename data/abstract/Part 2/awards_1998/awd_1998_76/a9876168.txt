Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks funding to develop an Internet-based, muti-user graphical
              worlds to support communal constructivist learning.  In particular a muti-user
              math game would be implemented in a 3-D graphical environment.  Students would
              be assessed on how and what they learn in these environments.  In stage 2, the
              students would build 3D games.  Students would be evaluated in terms of what
              they learn from this type of programming in terms of mathematical reasoning as
              well as knowledge of computer programming.  Finally, the study will also
              examine how student learning is facilitated by on on-line community.  The
              proposal also seeks to understand how on-line communities can support the
              learning that takes place as students develop the games and simulations.  In
              summary, the research project explores two hypotheses; first that three
              dimensional multi-user virtual words on the Internet have a unique potential to
              help students learn about mathematics and computer science in an
              interdisciplinary, peer-supported constructivist setting; and second that
              community support for constructivist learning can make that learning scaleable
              and sustainable.
