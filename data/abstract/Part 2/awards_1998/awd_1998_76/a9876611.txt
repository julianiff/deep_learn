The University of Georgia, working in collaboration with ten
              Georgia colleges of education, provides a series of workshops and ongoing
              support programs that feature contemporary applications of technology and
              mathematics pedagogy in the middle grades.  Technology is used both as a
              delivery vehicle and as a tool to support mathematics teaching and learning
              activities in participants' classrooms.  Through this project a cadre is
              established of more than 1,000 educators who are aware of current trends and
              thinking in mathematics education and who are innovative in their thinking
              about the integration of technology into mathematics teaching and
              learning.

InterMath has two primary components: 1) a 100-hour intensive
              hands-on workshop (45 hour) including local implementation at participant sites
              (55 hours); and 2) a follow-along system which will support teachers beyond the
              initial workshops.  The 55-hour site based component is threaded throughout the
              45-hour workshop and will focus heavily on scaffolding teachers' in-school
              reform efforts while participating educators are engaged in the intensive
              workshop experience.
