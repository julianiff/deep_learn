This award supports research in the study of the interaction of
              positrons with atoms and molecules.  A number of physical processes will be
              investigated, including the determination of low-energy, differential elastic
              and inelastic scattering cross sections and the excitation of molecular
              vibrations.  Specific attention will be paid to trying to understand the
              anomalously large annihilation rates observed for molecules containing more
              than a few atoms and the study of positron annihilation as a function of
              positron energy near the threshold for positronium atom formation.
