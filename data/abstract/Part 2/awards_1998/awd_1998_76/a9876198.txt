              Proposal Title: 	CAREER: A Generalized Approach to Modeling and Virtual
              Prototyping of Advanced Materials Processes for Semiconductor and Optical
              Applications

The primary research goal of this
              proposal is to develop a generalized, integrated model and virtual prototyping
              methodology that can be used for a variety of complex materials manufacturing
              processes.  The model will first be applied to the simulation and design of
              physical vapor transport (PVT)-based bulk growth of silicon carbide (SiC)
              crystals and hydrothermal growth of optical materials.  SiC is a wide band-gap
              material with physical and electronic properties unmatched for high
              temperature, high frequency, high power devices.  Applications ranging from
              greatly improved high voltage switching to sensors for control of engine
              emissions are envisioned; however, these applications are yet to be realized
              primarily because crystal growth methodology and device fabrication technology
              are not sufficiently developed.  Physical phenomena in both PVT growth of SiC
              and hydrothermal synthesis include the dissolution and sublimation of
              polycrystalline materials, which involve transport of charge and chemical
              species as well as deposition on the seed surface.  The virtual prototyping
              algorithm will incorporate robust process modeling techniques for transport
              phenomena, geometric models, and process animation.  The proposed research will
              bring together the knowledge developed in the fields of process modeling,
              geometric modeling, computer graphics, CAD, visualization and animation, and
              software development to model a wide range of materials processes that are
              based on PVT, CVD, and solution growth techniques.  Educational initiatives
              will include development of new courses in the field of modeling and virtual
              prototyping.
