This CAREER plan addresses
              research in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and student training in CVD.  The
              main objective of the research program is to obtain molecular understanding of
              the controlling factors for growing large, single crystals during chemical
              vapor processing.  A set of selective nucleation and growth experiments, using
              a microwave CVD reactor, will be carried out.  Atomic force microscopy will be
              used to characterize the early stages of individual crystal growth during CVD. 
              This experimental program will be complemented with Monte Carlo simulations
              focused on calculating the growth rates and morphologies of individual
              crystals.  The morphologies of simulated crystals will be compared with those
              observed experimentally to determine the effects of gas-surface reactions,
              dislocations, and impurities on growth faceting.  These studies along with
              proposed experiments on controlled nucleation of platelet shaped crystals will
              be used to develop substrate independent methods for growing large single
              crystals of diamond from the vapor phase and gallium nitride from the liquid
              phase.  The education plan is to develop courses in the areas of CVD and thin
              film characterization.  The development of interactive World Wide Web
              educational materials for delivery of both lecture and laboratory courses is
              also planned.
