Title: Genetics of Courtship Behavior in Nasonia


Little is
              known about the genetic basis of behavior. One reason is that behaviors are
              complex traits that clearly involve many different biological interactions.
              Research proposed here will take advantage of the special features of the
              parasitic insect Nasonia to investigate the genetic basis of behavioral
              differences between species. Special attention will be placed on interactions
              between genes affecting male courtship behavior. These insect species differ in
              patterns and timing of behavior. In addition, abnormal behaviors occur within
              hybrids, due to interactions between genes of the two species. Dissecting the
              genetic basis of these abnormal behaviors will help to reveal how gene
              interactions affect behavior.


Nasonia has haplodiploid sex determination;
              males are haploid (one set of chromosomes) whereas females are diploid (two
              sets of chromosomes). This feature greatly facilitates the genetic dissection
              of gene interactions affecting behavior. Using molecular markers, the
              interacting genetic regions causing abnormal male behaviors and cycle time
              differences will be mapped and characterized. The research will provide the
              tools needed for future cloning and sequencing of these' behavioral genes. It
              could then be determined whether similar (homologous) "behavioral" genes occur
              in other organisms, including vertebrates.
