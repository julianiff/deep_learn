Being an economist requires that we respond to the troubling
              question,
"Don't economists assume that everyone is selfish?"  While it is
              certainly
true that most economic models involve actors who value only their
              own
consumption, this has long been recognized as a simplifying assumption
              and
not descriptively accurate.  My proposed research is aimed at
              increasing
the descriptive accuracy of economic theory by incorporating social
              and
psychological concerns.  The goal of my research is to demonstrate
              and
investigate how psychological concepts impact economic decisions. 
              I
investigate concepts from social psychology (e.g. equity and
              helping
behavior) from cognitive psychology (e.g. nonconsequential reasoning
              and
framing) and cross-cultural psychology (e.g. collectivism
              and
individualism) on economic decisions like bargaining and public
              goods
provision.  My research demonstrates the impact of these concepts
              on
economic behavior and suggests new, more descriptively accurate, models of
              human behavior.
