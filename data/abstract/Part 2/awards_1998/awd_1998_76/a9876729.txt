The proposal involves a study of various aspects of motivic
              cohomology and its relationship with K-theory and Hodge theory.  One project is
              to extend the theory of Bloch's higher Chow groups to schemes in mixed
              characteristic and to construct a spectral sequence from the higher Chow groups
              to the K-theory of the category of coherent sheaves on such a scheme.  A
              further goal of this project is to establish the expected properties of the
              higher Chow groups to furnish a good theory of motivic cohomology for regular
              schemes, as well as the expected properties of the above-mentioned spectral
              sequence.  A second project is to give an integral version of the
              Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures using a holomorphic version of motivic
              cohomology as a replacement for the modular theory.  A third project is to
              investigate some modular properties of differential forms with log poles and
              integral periods, and the fourth project is to give a computation of the
              integral motive for classical groups.

This research is in the area of number
              theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural
              numbers.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics.  Within the last half
              century it has become an indispensible tool in diverse applications in areas
              such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
