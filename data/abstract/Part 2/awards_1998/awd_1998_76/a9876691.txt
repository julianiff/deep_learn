              Award Abstract - 9876691

This award will support the fabrication of a new
              kind of metal particle, by lithography and metal deposition, and the testing of
              these particles in important areas of biological research.  These designer
              particles will be produced and tested for biolistics-mediated genetic
              transformation of plant and mammalian cells.  The particular biological testing
              studies to be conducted with the designer particles include (1) a comparative
              study of plant genetic transformation efficiency by biolistics between the gold
              designer particles and conventional tungsten and gold particles (2) the use of
              cobalt designer particles for the study of the viscoelastic response of model
              tissues by the using magnetic tweezers to apply oscillating or static forces to
              magnetic designer particles embedded in the model tissue, and (3) a comparative
              study of mammalian cell transformation efficiency by biolistics between
              conventional gold particles and gold designer particles.  These studies will
              include the delivery of DNA vaccines, green fluorescent protein-myosin fusion
              proteins, and molecules controlling assembly and disassembly of neuronal
              processes in the retina, mutant ion channels.
