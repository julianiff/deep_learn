The research focuses on fundamental processes in plasmas for
              which precise experimental tests of theory can be made.  Experiments are
              performed on non-neutral plasmas using three, existing electron traps.  The
              simplicity of these systems facilitates precise comparisons between
              theory/simulation and experiment.  This enables a depth of understanding rarely
              possible in neutral plasmas in complex geometries.
