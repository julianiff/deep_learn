This career development plan developes research and
              education agendas along two dimensions:  how to measure information value and
              how to evaluate information productivity.

The first study devolopes a
              proof-theoretic model of value by combining concepts of utility and
              time-discounting from economics and procedural information from computer
              science.  By modeling information as an uncertainty reducing series of
              instructions, a decision maker creates a call on a particular result. 
              Financial options theory might then be used to value the information
              instrument.  The significance is that numerous management decisions might
              benefit from having better information value tools.

The second study
              provides an empirical complement by gathering data on management practices that
              contribute to productivity.  Software monitors will track organizational
              information flows.  Interviews will provide context.  Hypotheses - such as the
              value of decentralized access, focused communications, and incentives to
              promote sharing - will be tested using econometrics.  Study benefits include
              better understanding of information productivity, use of person rather than
              firm level data, and newly developed integration metrics.

Related
              educational activities include mentoring Ph.D. research assistants, teaching
              these topics in a new Information, Economics, Management, and Policy track, and
              codeveloping dual degrees in Public Policy, Electrical Engineering & Computer
              Science, and Law.
