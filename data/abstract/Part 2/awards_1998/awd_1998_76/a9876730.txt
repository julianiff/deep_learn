The Whole Earth Telescope (WET)
              project involves over a dozen observatories around the world in coordinated
              observational campaign to observe white dwarfs.  During a given multi-week
              international campaign, target stars are observed around-the-clock.  From these
              continuous records of photometric variability, many different frequencies of
              oscillation can be detected.  Each is related directly to a given depth,
              opacity, density, and ionization state in the stellar interior.  Detailed
              analysis of the frequencies observed yields high precision cooling rates,
              composition and masses that are unachievable by any other means.  Analogous to
              earthquake studies of the Earth's interior, asteroseismology provides one of
              the few observational verifications of theoretical models of stellar interiors.
               

Variability in pulsation amplitudes of white dwarfs has been found on all
              of the timescales studied to date-from hours to years.  The basic structure of
              the star implied by the models remains stable, but additional amplitude
              modulation appears in the improved observational data, suggesting that current
              models are incomplete in significant ways.  This project will monitor these
              ongoing changes and look for patterns in the data.  Its primary focus is the
              effort to improve the theoretical models, especially the effects of
              crystallization, H and He atmosphere layer thickness, and interior C/O
              abundance.
