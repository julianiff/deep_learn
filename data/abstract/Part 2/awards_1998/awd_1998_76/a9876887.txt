Abstract    :
              Powerful winds and jets are among the most dramatic manifestations of accreting
              black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Recent consideration of the
              energetics of accretion flows suggests that such outflows are not only
              inevitable, but that the mass loss may be so strong that all but a tiny
              fraction of the supplied matter is expelled before it reaches the black hole. 
              This project studies the theoretical ramifications and observational
              consequences of this new view of accretion in AGN.  Although the loss of mass,
              angular momentum, and energy are interrelated in a predictable way, the
              specifics of the outflows depend on microphysical details. Dr. Begelman is
              constructing "inflow-outflow" models, calculating their radiative properties,
              and studying their relationships to the production and collimation of
              relativistic jets as well as their interactions with the AGN
              environment.

The relativistic jets in AGNs may be one consequence of
              powerful mass loss from the inner parts of accretion flows, but the jets could
              also derive much of their energy from the spin of the black hole.  Dr. Begelman
              is also studying how the extraction of spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek
              effect depends on the black hole's accretion history and its current
              environment.  Dr. Begelman is also studying the braod z-ray iron lines and
              relativistic "diskoseismology" - the study of trapped oscillations in the inner
              regions of accretions disks - as observational probes of strong gravity regions
              close to black holes.
