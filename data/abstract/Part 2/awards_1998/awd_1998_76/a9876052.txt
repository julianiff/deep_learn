CAREER - A Framework for Fault-Tolerant and Secure Agents

The research considers agent-based systems, and develops techniques
              
to support the development of reliable agent-based applications
in large and
              open distributed systems. Such applications are 
important for the growth of
              electronic commerce, and Internet 
computing.

The main goals of the
              research is to provide a framework for secure, 
fault-tolerant, and
              heterogeneous agents and to study fundamental
limitations on such a framework.
              The desired agent characteristics 
are achieved automatically with little or
              no modification to the 
source code. The research uses compiler techniques to
              provide the 
ability for applications to save and restore their execution
              states 
in a heterogeneous environment. Code hiding techniques are 
developed
              to provide secure agent execution in hostile environments 
without
              compromising source code or execution results. Compiler
techniques are also
              used to provide fault tolerance, and new techniques
are developed for
              tolerating failures in heterogeneous environments.

The research is
              complemented by an educational component, the main 
goal of which is to
              attract undergraduate students to do research 
in computer science.
