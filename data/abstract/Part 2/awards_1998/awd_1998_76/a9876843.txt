Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to use a time-series of the relevant atmospheric, hydrologic and
              oceanic parameters in conjunction with remote sensing methods to examine the
              Siberian shelf-land system.  The impact of linkages between hydrology,
              atmospheric circulation and the sea-ice regime over the Siberian shelves will
              be assessed for a decadal variability that affects the Eurasian Arctic.  The
              study will identify 1) links among riverine fresh-water supply, sea-ice
              formation and sediment export by ice rafting, 2) quantify the regional and
              temporal variability of the relevant processes, 3) determine the relative
              importance of major, catastrophic events as compared to the gradual
              evolutionary regime of coastal and basin-wide sediment transport, 4) identify a
              set of critical processes and parameters that delimit the gradual and the
              catastrophic regime.  Those analyses will yield an understanding of land-ocean
              interactions that will yield important information necessary for predicting
              impacts from global change in the Arctic.
