CAREER:  Integration of Planning
              and Control for Nonlinear Systems

The classical approach to motion control
              for nonlinear systems can  be broken down into two independent steps.  Path
              planning is done first, and then a tracking control law is found which
              guarantees that the system converges to the desired path.  The goal of this
              research is to develop a unified framework in which to address the both the
              planning and the tracking problems for nonlinear systems.  The strategy for
              accomplishing this research goal is to first quantify several characteristics
              of trajectories for nonlinear systems.  Trajectory planning algorithms will
              then be developed for a broad class of nonlinear systems.  Finally, the
              integration of feedback control with the planned trajectories will be examined,
              and algorithms will be developed for generating both the planning and tracking
              control laws.  The results of this research will have a broad impact on the
              growing area of autonomous systems, allowing for better reactions to changing
              conditions such sensed obstacles or large disturbances.  By considering the
              planning and tracking problems in an integrated fashion, paths can be generated
              that are "easy" for the system to follow: fast, robust, stable, and requiring
              minimum energy.
The education plan for this project includes developing a set
              of web-based tutorials to teach students the importance and utility of system
              modeling concepts.  By using powerful simulation software, nonlinear system
              models can be treated quite easily, and more realistic examples can be
              incorporated into system modeling courses.
