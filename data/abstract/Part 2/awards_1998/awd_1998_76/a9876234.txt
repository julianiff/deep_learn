Abstract    :
              John Desjarlais is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program and the Molecular Biophysics program to develop and
              experimentally evaluate the use of computational methods for the design and
              engineering of proteins.  Algorithms will be developed using a combination of
              combinatorial optimization methods and atomistic force fields for the
              evaluation of protein designs.  The proposed experiments will be used to
              evaluate the effects of designed changes on the properties of proteins such as
              stability, dynamics, structure, and most importantly, function.  The protein
              currently under investigation is the cold shock protein B from Bacillus
              subtilis, chosen for its small size, ease of production, and readily measurable
              properties.  Desjarlais' teaching plan involves the development of new courses
              on Biophysical Chemistry and Computational Biology.  The courses will be
              developed and taught in conjunction with the Penn State University Life
              Sciences Consortium.

The field of protein design has continued to grow since
              its inception in the 1980's.  The design, production, and biophysical
              characterization of novel proteins or variants of natural proteins has provided
              a wealth of insight into the qualities of amino acid sequences required for the
              folding of proteins into well defined, stable structures.   Recent developments
              in the combination of computational and experimental methods for protein design
              has opened up exciting opportunities for the future of protein design and
              engineering.  This promise may ultimately lead to the design of novel proteins
              or modification of the properties of existing proteins, such as increased
              thermal or chemical stability.  Success in these efforts will also create new
              avenues for the design of nanotechnological devices and molecules with
              therapeutic or industrial value.
