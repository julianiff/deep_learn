Abstract    :
              
A nested three-dimensional (3D) material and structural modeling framework is
              proposed for nonlinear damage analysis of fiber-reinforced composite
              structures.  Micromechancial and damage models for different composite material
              systems, such as unidirectional fiber reinforced polymeric (FRP) composites,
              woven and braided fabrics, can be directly integrated within the components: 
              elastic-degrading continuum damage models for each of the matrix and fiber
              periodic medium, and a 3D sublaminate model for a repeating ply stacking
              sequence.  The beyond initial failure.  The framework is implemented within a
              displaced-based 3D nonlinear finite-element code.  As a result, progressive
              damage modeling of composite structures is achieved.  This approach allows
              nonlinear anisotropic response, including strain-softening and damaged elastic
              unloading behavior.  Fiber modes of failure are also recognized, including
              fiber microbuckling.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to
              enhance understanding of the microstructural properties of heterogeneous
              materials that strongly influence the global damage response of composite
              structures.
