Abstract    :
              Many predator-prey populations follow predictable cycles, with the
              10-year
cycles of snowshoe hares and lynx among the most remarkable.  However,
              in
the southern part of their range (including Montana), the hare/lynx cycle
              is
apparently dampened, perhaps due to forest fragmentation causing hares
              to
die in open-canopy areas before numbers can increase.  As a
              specialized
predator, lynx in turn are thought to be noncyclic at
              low-densities in these
areas. I will use mark-recapture sampling and telemetry
              to test this
possible consequence of fragmentation, and will estimate, for the
              first
time, population densities using DNA profiles of lynx hairs.
 Although
              effects of forest fragmentation have been investigated for a
number of
              species, this will be the first major effort to look at
consequences on both
              prey (hare) and predator (lynx).  In this 4-year study
I will seek basic
              principles driving population biology of cyclic,
interdependent species in a
              human-modified landscape.  Benefits of such
knowledge are amplified by the
              fact that U.S. lynx are considered to be
declining and possibly endangered.  A
              key part of this proposal includes
developing a long-term and self-sustaining
              intern program, whereby
undergraduates (particularly Native Americans) gain
              field experience and
formal educational training allowing them to translate
              scientific research
into educational outreach.
