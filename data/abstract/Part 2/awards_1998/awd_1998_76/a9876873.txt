This U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Research award is for
              research on the Many Body Theory of Ferromagnetic Metals.  The principal
              investigators are Kevin S. Bedell of Boston College, and, for the Bulgarian
              side, Drs. Naoum I. Karchev and Krastan B. Blagoev.  The many body physics of
              electron correlations determine the magnetic properties of many materials of
              prime interest to science and technology.  In this proposal, the researchers
              will study how renormalized electrons react with their own collective
              excitations determining the physical properties of the material.  Specifically,
              they will study these interactions in metals in the neighborhood of the
              ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition.  The participants will benefit
              from combining and sharing their complementary but unique skills.  Dr. Bedell
              has developed phenomenological techniques for the descriptions of metals; Drs.
              Karchev and Blagoev have expertise in the microscopic foundations of metals. 
              This collaboration will support the development of a deeper understanding of
              weak ferromagnetism in metals.  The amalgamation of theoretical tools will be
              applied to different models and will shed light on the physics of real
              materials.  The researchers will focus on Ni3Al, MnSi, and ZrZn2.

This
              research in physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together
              leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
