Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of
              ANIR's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102.    Researchers
              at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) and the University of
              Arkansas
for Medical Sciences (UAMS), in collaboration with the University
              of
Arkansas at Fayetteville (UAF), have formed a consortium, ARKnet2.
              
ARKnet2 is to make available high bandwidth communication resources and
will
              develop an interstate high bandwidth connections network for
university
              researchers,  which will have connections to a national high
bandwidth
              network.

The Arkansas Consortium plans to build a ATM-based ARKnet2 backbone
              from
Little Rock to Fayetteville.   Arkansas is a member of the Great
              Plains
Network (GPN), which will share resources among six states that are
              all
qualified for EPSCoR funding.   The GPN will connect ARKnet2 to its
              gigaPOP
in Kansas City and will provide access to the vBNS and federal
              agency
networks.

Research supported by the resulting network access
              includes: seismic
analysis, nanodimensional molecular device modeling,
              combustion analysis
and computational fluid dynamics, microscopy and
              biotechnology advances,
fetal magnetoencephalography, and studies of
              physiological effects of
microgravity.   Collaborations will involve
              facilities and universities
including: NASA Johnson Space Center, University
              of Florida, University of
Tennessee, Old Dominion University, Yale, Louisiana
              State University,
Temple University, and Argonne National Laboratory.
