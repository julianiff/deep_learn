Digital Government:  A Framework for the Dissemination, Use, and
              Storage of Geospatial Images for Field Data Collection

This project has two
              components; 1) a planning process for a later proposal partnering the
              researchers with the Natural Resources Conservation Center of the US Department
              of Agriculture, and 2) several small workshops to foster information exchange
              between GIS experts, the computer/information science research community, and
              Federal agencies with related interests. The general focus is to develop a
              framework by which multidimensional spatial data can be collected, analyzed,
              and distributed in a networked environment. The domain area of Federal
              statistics is a vehicle for exploring technologies that have the potential to
              be applied in other departments and domains.
