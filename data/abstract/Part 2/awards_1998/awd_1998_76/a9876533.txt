              ABSTRACT

OCE-9876533

:In an effort to produce modeling parameters to
              describe the CO2-neutralizing capacity of carbonate sediments, Drs. W. Martin
              and F. Sayles propose to synthesize the large data set (made available through
              the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS) and otherwise) describing
              organic decomposition and calcite dissolution in the uppermost millimeters of
              ocean sediments.  Sediment chemistry models will be developed to describe these
              processes in sediments in nine select sites of the world ocean, and the results
              would be extrapolated to larger regional/global scales.  The results would be
              used to provide input into the ongoing U.S.JGOFS effort to model the role of
              the ocean in global carbon cycling.
