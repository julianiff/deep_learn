Abstract    :
              
Animals in nature must forage for food to help pay their energy debts.  When
              their current energy bills are paid, excess energy can be stored internally as
              body fat, or externally as a food hoard.  Little is known about the
              distribution of energy among these alternatives and less is known about energy
              distribution with the addition of other energy consumers - offspring - whether
              as fetuses during pregnancy, or as young during lactation.  The first goal is
              to determine the energy distribution strategies during the energetically
              demanding conditions of pregnancy or lactation.  A second goal is to determine
              if a proposed signal of body fat stores, leptin, affects energy distribution
              strategies.  This will accomplished using a species that naturally hoards food,
              Siberian hamsters. Foraging effort will be controlled by varying the required
              number of running wheel revolutions to earn food pellets from outside a
              semi-natural burrow.  We will measure the amount of food foraged, eaten,
              hoarded, stored as fat, and deposit in their offspring during pregnancy,
              lactation, or with leptin treatment.  Collectively, these results should help
              define the energy budget strategies of animals raising their young.  This is a
              fundamental problem in the regulatory biology of all species.
