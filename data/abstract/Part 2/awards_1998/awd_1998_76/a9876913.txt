This project explores the dynamics of collisions between atoms
              at ultracold temperatures, emphasizing the unique roles played by light in
              controlling and altering the collision dynamics.  Collisions involving the
              absorption of two photons will be studied because of their unique sensitivity
              to the light frequencies used, the variety of observable phenomena, and new
              abilities to quantitatively and realistically model the collision processes. 
              The results will have impact on physical problems and processes that involve
              the use of laser cooling.
