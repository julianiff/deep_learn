The main objective of this
              project is for the Principal Investigator to determine the present mass balance
              and volume changes, averaged over five years, of about seventy representative
              glaciers in Alaska, northwestern Canada, and a few in Washington.  This area is
              one of the largest glaciated regions in the world outside the polar regions,
              but only five to six glaciers out of thousands have been regularly monitored
              and have long-term records.   These balances will be determined by repeating
              the baseline elevation profiles on the glaciers.  The mass balances will be
              examined in terms of the contribution of the glaciers to sea level rise to
              determine regional trends in climate change and any possible temporal trends. 
              Historically, mass balances of glaciers and ice sheets are very difficult to
              measure.  This difficulty is particularly true for mountain glaciers because of
              the complex mountain barriers and the wide variety of climate regimes. 
              Furthermore,  satellite rader altimetry has not been used to successfully
              measure the mass balance of these glaciers because of their large and irregular
              surface slopes and relatively small areas.  An important objective of this
              project will be to determine the applicability and accuracy of airborne
              profiling to measure the annual mass balances by making repeated profiles on
              selected glaciers over the four years of this project.
