The New Standards Project will establish a mathematics task
              bank and create a pool that balances coverage of tasks that assess procedural
              skills, conceptual understanding, and problem solving in the content areas of 
              Number, Geometry, Measurement, Algebra, Functions, and Statistics Probability,
              at each grade level in grades 3-10.  All the tasks will be accompanied by
              scoring guides and sample student responses.

The bank will be available on a
              website with three levels of security:  public (open to anyone who logs on);
              and school and external assessment levels who agree to certain conditions of
              use.

The project will also have a research component where the analytic
              framework developed by Glaser and Baxter for science assessments will be
              extended to mathematics.  They will focus on two issues:  (1) the match or
              mismatch between the intentions of task developers and the nature of the
              cognitive activity elicited by the task; and  (2) the correspondence between
              the quality of the cognitive activity and the ways in which student performance
              is scored and evaluated.  Findings will be applied to the development of tasks
              for the bank, and presented in other venues.
