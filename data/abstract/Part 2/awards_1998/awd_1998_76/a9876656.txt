Abstract    :
              MIRABU (Mid-InfraRed Array for Boston University) will be a mid-infrared camera
              system with both spectroscopic and imaging capabilities.  The system is based
              on a new 320 x 240 Si:As IBC array developed by Raytheon/SBRC.  MIRABU will
              offer a large field of view (1.6' x 1.2'), diffraction-limited spatial
              resolution , complete spectral coverage over the 8-14 micron and 17-26 micron
              atmospheric windows for both imaging and spectroscopy, and high sensitivity (5
              and 20 mJy for a point source at 10 and 20 micron, respectively, for on-source
              integration time of 30 seconds).  MIRABU will be suited for studies of young
              stellar objects and star formation, planetary and protoplanetary nebulae,
              starburst galaxies, and solar system objects such as planets, asteroids, and
              comets.
