              Award Abstract - 9876683

This award supports the construction of a functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) -compatible eye tracking system for use in a
              3.0 Tesla human fMRI scanner.  The most important sense by which human beings
              experience their universe is vision.  Most of the human brain is dedicated to
              processing the many facets of visual sensation derived from the complex
              apparatus of the eyes.  The response of the eyes to the visual world, as
              measured by a number of eye tracking methods, has proven to be immensely
              valuable as a behavioral window onto human brain function.  Mapping the
              neuronal networks that coordinate the eyes with the visual experience processed
              by the brain and perceived by the mind can now be achieved with fMRI at high
              spatial and temporal resolution.  The complete interpretation of these data
              requires that eye position be measured simultaneously with the mapping by fMRI.
               This seemingly simple task poses several severe challenges of
              mutual-incompatibilities with existing equipment.  This project has defined
              these challenges and will approach solutions.  Thus the project supported by
              this award will construct a robust investigational fMRI-compatible eye tracking
              system that can be used routinely by investigators funded to study human
              cognition using fMRI and eye movement.
