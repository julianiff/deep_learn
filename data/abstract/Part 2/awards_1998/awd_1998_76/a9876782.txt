Abstract    :
              After rapid expansion in the 1960 to early 1980s, the Invertebrate Paleontology
              Collection of the Oklahoma of Natural History underwent a period of minimal
              growth that followed the retirement of the curator, Patrick K. Sutherland. 
              Without a curator, collection activity declinced significantly and many of the
              original wooden cases have been damaged through termite infestation.  And yet,
              the collection is among the largest in the museum (250,000 specimens) and
              contains several thousand type and figured specimens from a number of landmark
              studies on the paleontology of Oklahoma and contiguous state.  The University
              of Oklahoma has renewed its commitment to the collection with the hiring of a
              new curator who will be assisted by a new, full-time curatorial specialist.  A
              large storage area (approximately 3,200 square feet)has been allocated to the
              collection in the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, a new facility which
              will be available early in 1999.  Restoration of the collection will be a
              multi-year project, the first phase of which will ensure that the specimens are
              unpacked promptly and adequately housed in metal cases.  Subsequent phases will
              involve production of a catalogue of type and figured specimens in both
              conventional print and electronic (web-based) media, and computerization of
              collection records, which are currently stored on a set of index cards.  This
              project will complete the replacement of antiquated wooden storage cabinets
              with new metal cases and support the hiring of temporary staff to assist with
              the unpacking and reorganization of the collection following the move to the
              new facility.  This project is clearly critical to the successful completion of
              subsequent phases of the restoration.
