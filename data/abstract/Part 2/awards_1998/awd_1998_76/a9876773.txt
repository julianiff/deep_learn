	The proposal is intended to investigate beam dynamics problems
              relevant to the understanding of the nonlinear particle motion in storage
              rings.  These proposed research topics are indispensable to nuclear physics
              research using high brightness particle beams.  The proposed research is also
              important in training accelerator physics graduate and undergraduate students. 
              In past few years, the IUCF Cooler Ring has become the world leading laboratory
              for nonlinear beam dynamics research.  More importantly, results of the Cooler
              Ring beam dynamics experiments have been employed to understand phenomena such
              as chaos, strange and limiting cycle attractors, and bifurcation
              characteristics of attractors.  Our experimental results have been used to
              improve Cooler beam quality, to provide design criterion for power supply
              ripple in high energy colliders, and to develope new methods for emittance
              preservation of high brightness beams.  Some applications of high brightness
              beams are meson factories, spallation neutron sources, heavy ion fusion,
              biochemistry and bio-medical, material science, and defense research.
