The objective of this research project is to develop an
              ultrastable CO2 laser trap for Li-6 fermions.  The proposed system offers many
              opportunities for exploring new physics in the cooling mechanisms and in the
              interparticle interactions, both in the nondegenerate and quantum degenerate
              regimes.  Efforts within the program comprise broad studies of the trap
              dynamics including:  1) precooling and loading from a magneto-optical trap; 2)
              demonstration of very long trap lifetimes; 3) inelastic collisions; 4) optical
              cooling of the trapped atoms; 5) laser noise-induced heating; and 6) modeling
              of focused gaussian beam traps.
