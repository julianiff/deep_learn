     The invstigator and his colleagues organize a meeting at
              the
Santa Fe Institute to study distributed autonomous systems.  Such
systems
              are comprised of many relatively simple elements that
operate without central
              direction.  Examples are metabolic
systems, ant colonies, distributed computer
              architectures, and
the immune system.  Emphasis is put on the immune system,
              because
of its great intrinsic interest, its importance in health
              and
disease, and the massive (but incomplete) detail known concerning
the
              operation of its trillions of cells.  Leading theorists and
experimentalists
              in immunology present a distillation of present
day experimental knowledge
              together with mathematical and
computer models based on this knowledge.  These
              experts seek to
formulate general principles that apply not only to the
              immune
system but also to the other distributed autonomous systems that
are
              under study.  Experts on the other systems report on their
specialties and
              also try to distill principles that are broadly
applicable.  Half the
              participants are graduate students and
postdocs, who can adopt the novel views
              expressed in their future
research.
     This meeting is concerned with the
              study of systems that can
accomplish a variety of complex tasks with a large
              leaderless
group of relatively primitive components.  The major example to
              be
studied is the immune system, with its trillions of cells and
hundreds of
              signaling chemicals.  Experimentalists and theorists
report on advances in
              understanding how the immune system can so
expertly perform a spectrum of
              tasks such as killing the large
variety of bacteria and viruses that invade
              the body.  Other
experts report on advances in understanding other
              complex
systems, such as the metabolic system that turns our food intake
into
              energy and growth, or systems of fictitious "agents" that
work in novel
              computer programs that attempt to reproduce aspects
of creative thought.  The
              clash of ideas that come from
simultaneous consideration of these different
              systems should
generate principles of wide applicability.  Such principles
              are
essential if we are to advance beyond the stage of collecting
pieces of
              data that add to our understanding of elements of
system behavior but leave us
              more and more baffled as to how all
these elements combine to give effective
              system performance, and
how we could ever manipulate system behavior with any
              confidence.
In time, identification and validation of these principles
              can
have far-reaching applications ranging from aid to physicians
              in
generating manipulations that help the immune system fight
disease, to
              enabling computer programmers to find novel ways to
fight "virus" and other
              intrusions into computer systems and to
design computer systems that "think"
              less rigidly and more
creatively than present "intelligent" computers.
