Abstract    :
              By providing a number of channels through which information may pass between
              user and computer, multimodal interfaces promise to significantly increase the
              bandwidth and fluidity of the interface between humans and machines.  Natural
              language processing techniques typically focus on processing strings of words
              within a single dimension.  This program of research seeks to develop an
              approach to multimodal language processing which enables parsing and
              interpretation of natural human input distributed across two or three spatial
              dimensions, time, and the acoustic dimension of speech.  A declarative
              unification-based grammar representation is proposed for the description of
              multimodal integration strategies.  This representation is interpreted by a
              multidimensional parser yielding an architecture which provides the foundation
              for next generation natural interfaces supporting human-computer interaction
              through speech, pen, gesture, and other modes.  Fundamental advances in
              multimodal interfaces are essential to the successful migration of
              human-computer interaction from the desktop to small mobile computing devices,
              public information kiosks, and other platforms for which complex graphical user
              interfaces are not feasible.  Multimodal interfaces stand to play a critical
              role both in realizing the vision of universal access to information and in the
              development of assistive technologies for people with disabilities.
