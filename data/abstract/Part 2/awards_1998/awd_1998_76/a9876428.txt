Abstract    :
              This action will complete the analysis of measurements of high energy cosmic
              rays made at high altitudes over the antarctic continent.  The balloon flights
              were part of the Japanese American Cosmic Ray Emulsion Chamber Experiment
              (JACEE), an internationally cooperative study of primary cosmic rays at
              energies greater than 1 TeV.
	
Extremely high energy cosmic rays show some
              unexpected and currently unexplained behavior.  Above approximately 1000 TeV
              the flux of particles is much less than is expected from extrapolating the
              intensity of source processes, and while several reasonable physical models of
              acceleration and propagation can account for the change in the slope of the
              flux as a function of energy curve, more primary data is needed to determine
              which model is the correct one.  Currently, results from the JACEE program on
              the primary spectrum and composition of cosmic rays are widely used by the
              particle astrophysics community as a standard reference for spectra in the very
              high energy range.
