Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to obtain a better understanding of how fungal cell
              wall composition and structure affect cellular physical properties. The results
              could lead to new and/or improved antibiotic fermentations and a better
              understanding of fungus/plant interactions. A model system using Aspergillus
              nidulans will be studied observing cell wall compositions (chitin, B-glucan,
              protein content, protein expression pattern) and physical properties (tensile
              strength, wall thickness, hyphal diameter) and correlating these properties
              with composition. A fungal strain with minimal hyphal fragmentation will be
              genetically engineered using the above relationships. The educational plan
              centers on the use of an engineer/life-scientist/industry collaboration to
              promote active, hands-on learning in the bioengineering field.
