This research program focuses on the continuation of the
              development and analysis of the properties of the microlaser.  Emphasis will be
              placed on the quantum mechanical behavior of this fundamental atom-cavity
              system.  Examples of properties that will be studied include the threshold
              behavior, the evolution of field statistics from nearly chaotic to
              sub-Poissonian, field and intensity correlation properties of the microlaser
              emission, intracavity photon statistics, and the relationship between
              microlaser behavior and conventional laser operation.  The experimental efforts
              will be accompanied by in-house theoretical analysis and will include technical
              developments to enhance the performance of the microlaser system.
