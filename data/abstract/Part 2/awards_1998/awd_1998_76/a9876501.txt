Abstract    :
              This grant funds research to complete the remaining three sections of a book,
              under contract with Oxford University Press, on the history of the British
              penal system from 1895 to the present.   This grant will allow the investigator
              to complete research in London on the unpublished papers of the Home Office,
              the Prison Commission, and the Lord Chancellor's Office.  The book will present
              a critical account of the essential principles and patterns of punishment in
              twentieth-century Britain.  It will investigate punishment from a very broad
              perspective: from law making, through sentencing, to the administration of
              legal penalties.  It will also emphasize the political and popular limits to
              the reforming ethos.  This book has the potential to make significant
              contributions to historical and socio-legal studies.  It will be interest to a
              number of subject groups, including scholars:  (1) concerned with law-creation,
              (2) examining sentencing and the judicial courts, (3) interested in the
              different modes of punishment, and (4) concerned with the impart on penal
              policy of the press and public opinion.  It will fill an existing gap in
              scholarship-current there is no existing synthesis of the trends in punishment
              over the past century and none that seek to situate the subject with the larger
              social, political, legal, and historical context.
