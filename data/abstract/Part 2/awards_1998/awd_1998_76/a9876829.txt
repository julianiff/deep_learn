Abstract    :
              This project will support the acquisition of equipment, supplies and travel
              needed to improve the Texas A&M 
University Insect Collection (TAMUIC)-a major
              insect research collection of approximately 1.55 million curated specimens with
              regional strengths in the south-central and southwestern U.S. and Mexico. 
              Specifically, the project will relocate and incorporate the orphaned Johnson
              Bruchid Collection into the TAMUIC Coleoptera collection, and  (2) replace
              non-standard/substandard cabinets used to house portions of the TAMUIC pinned
              collection as part of a long-term plan to install a compactor system in the
              TAMUIC to accommodate future growth.

The Johnson Bruchid Collection contains
              representatives of approximately 1000 bruchid species(ca.2/3 of
the 1500 world
              species of this group) and is one of the most important collections of New
              World seed beetles ever assembled.  The collection was built by Dr. Clarence D.
              "Dan. "Johnson, former Professor of Biological Sciences of the Department of
              Biological Sciences at Northern Arizona University(NAU).  Over the past 35
              years, Dr. Johnson has been one of the two dominant figures in New World
              bruchid systematics.  The collection contains an estimated 200,000-250,000
              specimens.  The collection has been orphaned at NAU since Dr. Johnson's
              retirement in 1994, and was formally offered to the TAMUIC for permanent
              deposition in June of 1998.

338,500 (21.9%) of the TAMUIC's 1.55 million
              specimens have been added to the collection during the last five years.  This
              substantial rate of growth has been the result of the collective efforts of a
              dedicated group of collection-associated faculty, staff, students and friends
              who are committed to the continued development of the TAMUIC as a central
              resource for the support of entomological systematics.  The rapid growth of
              recent years shows no sign of slowing, and has spurred the development of a
              strategic plan by collection curators to accommodate future growth within the
              relatively static space currently allocated to the collection.  This plan calls
              for the eventual installation of a compactor system in the TAMUIC's main
              collection room, and, in preparation for this installation, the replacement of
              certain non-standard collection storage equipment that are impediments to
              efficient compactor storage.  Much of this equipment also contains structural
              defects which impedes its proper functioning in the collection.  This project
              will also support the replacement of non-standard and substandard insect
              cabinets currently used to store portions of the TAMUIC pinned collection. 
              Following this replacement, all pinned materials in the TAMUIC will be housed
              in secure, modern, steel cabinets and will be ready for installation on a
              compactor system.
