Abstract    :
              Abstract

The specific interaction between molecules is at the core of all
              biological processes.  As an instrument, the analytical ultracentrifuge has
              been a core technology for characterizing the strength, shape and size of
              molecular complexes.  For many biological questions, there is no substitute
              method for analyzing molecular interactions.  However, the existing analytical
              ultracentrifuge is limited in the range of questions it can address.  New and
              improved optical systems described in this proposal will overcome many of these
              limitations, thus allowing the analysis of trace materials, improving the
              precision of 
the measurements 100-fold and extending the analysis of
              concentrated mixtures by a factor of 10.  Specifically, fluorescence, schlieren
              and turbidity detectors will be added.  Improvements will be made to the
              computer systems that operate these detectors, and improvements will be made to
              the computer program used for interpreting sedimentation data
