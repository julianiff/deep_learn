Abstract    :
              The Graduate College of Marine Studies of the University of Delaware offers a
              summer Marine Sciences Undergraduate Internship program.  The program is open
              to undergraduate students from across the United States in any science or
              engineering major.  Students must be US citizens or permanent residents and
              should preferably be between their junior and senior year.  Each student
              selected receives a stipend for the 10-week summer period plus free dormitory
              and tuition coverage for the research credit.  Each student performs an
              independent research project during the summer with supervision by a faculty
              member and presents oral and written reports at the end of the summer.  Each
              summer, 10 students are selected for the program.
