This award supports research in the area of the foundations of
              fundamental quantum optics and quantum mechanics as explored through the
              technique of quantum state reconstruction.  The goal of the project is to
              advance the state of the art in the preparation and measurement of quantum
              states of light beyond single modes of the optical field to the next level of
              complexity, multimode fields.  This will be done using the concept of balanced
              homodyne detection.  The outcome of this work in terms of techniques for
              measurement of optical correlations and statistics will have a broad impact in
              the interpretation of results from other areas such as atom interferometry,
              quantum computing, and molecular vibrational-state engineering
