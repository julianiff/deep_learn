Abstract    :
              	The investigators undertake a multidimensional study of the forthcoming
              electoral cycle in the Russian Federation.  If the normal schedule is
              respected, then Russians are expected to elect a new State Duma in December
              1999; in July 2000, they elect a president.  The Russian electorate is the
              fourth largest in the world.  If faces choices which are unusual in their
              complexity and importance, even in a transitional regime.  Boris Yeltsin has
              been president of the country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  The
              impending elections are most likely to result in the handing of state power to
              a new set of leaders and  to the initation of a new period in the political
              development of the country and of the world region.
	The investigators plan to
              study the elections with a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.
               They undertake a three-wave panel survey of the electorate, with two waves
              bracketing the parliamentary election and a third wave following the
              presidential election.  The questionnaires build on earlier work by Colton,
              incorporate the full question module of the Comparative Study of Electoral
              Systems, which is based at the University of Michigan, and draw on qualitative
              work done by McFaul.  This work proceeds in 1999-2000 out of the Moscow Center
              of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace.  The surveys gather
              information about the full range of explanatory variables of interest to
              comparative students of electoral behavior and, of course, about factors
              embedded in the unique Russian and post-Soviet experience.  A fourth survey is
              of the surviving members of a panel of respondents assembled for the study of
              the Russian elections of 1995-96.  The survey work is complemented by focus
              groups and by elite tracking work managed by McFaul.
	The two investigators
              intend to coauthor a study of electoral behavior in 1999-2000, which is framed
              in the comparative literature and designed to produce scholarly articles on
              themes in the development of the Russian electorate.  The data are available to
              CSES and the scholarly community.
