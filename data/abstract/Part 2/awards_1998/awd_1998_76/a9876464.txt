The conference Orbis Scientiae 1998, to be held in Ft.
              Lauderdale, Florida, December 17-21, 1998, will cover several very timely
              topics in elementary particle physics.  A particular focus will be the physics
              and astrophysics of massive neutrinos.  The conference will provide for the
              very important exchange of ideas among leading scientists in the field.
