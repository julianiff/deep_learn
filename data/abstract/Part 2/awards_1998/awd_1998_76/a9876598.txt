This research program focuses on the study of reflection of
              atoms from surfaces at very small incident kinetic energies.  The work will
              rely on recent advances in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms to create an
              ultracold atomic beam.  The atoms will be launched at a controlled velocity
              toward a surface and the reflection probability will be measured.  As a first
              test of the system, quantum reflection from an evanescent wave mirror will be
              measured.  In the next stage of research, quantum reflection will be studied in
              an atomic interferometer.  Reflection from a variety of surfaces will then be
              studied without the evanescent wave in order to probe fundamental atom-surface
              interactions.
