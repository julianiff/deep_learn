Digital Government: 
              Information Technology Accommodation Research: Creating a Doorway for Universal
              Access

This proposal would continue the work of the Archimedes project at
              Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information.  Using the needs
              of the disabled as drivers, CSLI will pursue research on a number of different
              access modalities.  One example is the Total Access Processor, a
              hardware/software abstraction layer between a disabled individual and the PC
              he/she uses, since their custom environment is tightly woven interwoven with
              their PC hardware, operating system, applications, etc.  TAP addresses the
              problem that occurs when the disabled individual upgrades hardware or software.
               This is of interest to the Census Bureau, which has goals in hiring large
              numbers of disabled individuals for the decennial census.  The Social Security
              Agency and the General Services Administration are interested for similar
              reasons, and the National Mapping and Imagery Agency is interested in the
              eye-tracking work of Scott related to productivity of individuals doing feature
              identification.
