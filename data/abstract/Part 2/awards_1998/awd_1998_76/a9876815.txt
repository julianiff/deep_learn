Abstract    :
              This project concerns the Vertebrate Paleontological Collections at the Peabody
              Museum of Natural History.  The foundation of the collections are those
              specimens collected in the American West by Othniel Charles Marsh during the
              storied "dinosaur rush" of the late 19th century.  The fossils stored in
              Marsh's Dinosaur Room include the first described specimens of such famous and
              familiar dinosaurs as Apatosaurus (Brontosaurus),  Barosaurus and Stegosaurus. 
              

Marsh's dinosaurs were reposited at Yale approximately seventy years ago. 
              The bones are stored on open racks with rusted metal grating shelves.  Many of
              the larger bones are stored on dirty, ancient jute-filled canvas pads.  The
              open storage has allowed all of the fossils to become covered with years of
              dust and grime.  Inadequately supported by the jute-filled pads, virtually
              ninety percent of the larger bones in the room have broken under their own
              weight.  Many others have broken due to the failure of old adhesives.  In many
              cases, various parts of one specimen are stored in differing parts of the room,
              making it even more difficult to study a single specimen.  

The entire
              Vertebrate Paleontology collection is slated to move after the construction of
              a new environmental science facility that will house other Peabody Museum
              collections.  When those collections are removed from the basement of Kline
              Geology Laboratory the Vertebrate Paleontology collection will expand into
              environmentally controlled spaces.  The project will treat these specimens
              before the move.  While the condition of the specimens alone merits the
              proposed project, the scheduled relocation makes it imperative to conserve the
              specimens now as it is impossible to safely move them in their current
              condition.

The steps taken to improve this collection will
              include:
1.	Small specimens and fragments that are currently in open cardboard
              trays will be placed in polyethylene foam lined trays or polypropylene
              containers, separated by polyethylene foam to prevent damage.  Where necessary,
              polyethylene foam mounts will be fabricated for smaller specimens in need of
              extra support.

2.	Longer, heavier bones, such as limb bones, will be
              supported with polyethylene foam lined plaster bedding jackets, and smaller
              bones, such as vertebrae, with polyethylene foam supports.  

3.	Fragile
              paper data will be cleaned and encapsulated in Mylar film to preserve
              it.

4.	All available data will be entered into the Peabody Museum's on-line
              data base.

5.	With the help of Dr. John McIntosh, an expert on both sauropod
              dinosaurs and the O.C. Marsh Expeditions, this material will be curated. 
              Locations and names will be noted on both shelf labels and in the computerized
              database.
