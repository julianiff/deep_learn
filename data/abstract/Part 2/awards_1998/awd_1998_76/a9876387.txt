Abstract    :
              This project explores reaction dynamics from a theoretical as well as an
              experimental standpoint.  The overall purpose is to investigate the extent to
              which nonstatistical dynamics play a role in normal thermal reactions.  Results
              already in hand suggest that these dynamics may be quite important. 
              Collaborative theoretical work will explore the dynamics of carbene formation
              and their rearrangements, the Cope rearrangement, and conformational dynamics
              of small peptides.  Experimental studies will seek to provide evidence of
              nonstatistical effects in carbene rearrangements and reactions in supercritical
              fluids.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues support for Professor Barry K. Carpenter of Cornell
              University-Endowed.  Professor Carpenter studies the intricacies of organic
              chemical reactions with a view to understanding more fully the assumptions that
              underlie organic chemists' ideas about how they work.  Carpenter and his
              collaborators will use computer simulations to test hypotheses and formulate
              theoretical results, which will then be tested in the laboratory for
              validity.
