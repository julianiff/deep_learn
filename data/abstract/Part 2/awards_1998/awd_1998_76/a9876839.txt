A void exists in capillary separations for a simple,
              nanolilter volume, optical detection that has high sensitivity and can be used
              universally.  The need for such a detector is particularly evident in the area
              of biological analysis, where the desired solute has little native absorbance
              or fluorescence.  The micro-interferometric backscatter detection (MIBD) system
              has the potential to fill this void.  MIBD has been employed for refractive
              index (RI) detection in CE and will be used to perform RI and polarimetric
              detection of poorly absorbing or non-fluorescent biologically important solutes
              in capillary electrochromatography (CEC).  MIBD is a significant advance in
              biological research instrumentation for several reasons.  The folded, yet
              simple and inexpensive, optical train is easy to align; the fused silica
              capillary is directly probed without modification; and multi-pass signal
              enhancement affords ultra-high sensitivity (micromolar) in nanoliter volumes. 
              Preliminary results also indicate MIBD can be used as a capillary-scale
              polarimetric detector, allowing optical activity detection (polarimetry) in
              sub-nanoliter volumes with CEC.  CEC is a powerful hybrid separation technique
              that uses features of both high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE)
              and liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Doing CEC on etched and functionalized
              capillaries, with inner diameters ranging from 20 to 100 mm, rapid and
              efficient separation of anionic and neutral compounds is possible, while
              avoiding some of the limitations encountered in packed capillaries.  The power
              of MIBD with CEC will allow new insights into the functionality of biologically
              significant species such as hormones, messengers and membrane constituents.  As
              a first step to providing enhanced knowledge about these important species,
              CEC-RI and CEC-polarimetry will be used to quantify angiotensins, inositol
              phosphates and phospholipids.
