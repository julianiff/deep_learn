Abstract    :
              Chris Cramer of the U. of Minnesota is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to pursue theoretical studies of structure and
              dynamics of variable-spin organic and inorganic systems.  He will develop
              analytic derivatives for self-consistent condensed-phase effects for
              high-accuracy electronic structure theories, a self-consistent reaction field
              model for singly excited states, and a theoretical model relating
              singlet-triplet splittings to spin densities.  Applications include substituent
              effects on nitrenium ions and aryl nitrenes, formation reactions of aryne
              biradicals, ferromagnetism in non-Kekule hydrocarbons, and dimetallic models of
              enzymes.

Many theoretical calculations apply only to molecules that are in
              the gas phase, rather than the more common experimental conditions of the
              condensed phase. This research involves augmenting existing theoretical methods
              with a solvation model in order to address the properties of reacting molecules
              in solution.  The newly derived techniques will be calibrated on a wide variety
              of problems of chemical and biological importance.
