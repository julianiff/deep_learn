This research project focuses on an analysis of the details of
              the interaction of x-rays with atoms and small molecules.  Particular attention
              will be paid to the extent to which the independent-particle approximation and
              the dipole approximation are valid in describing the experimental results.  The
              experiments will be performed at the Advanced Light Source.
