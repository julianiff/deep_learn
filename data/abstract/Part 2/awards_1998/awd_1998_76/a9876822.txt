Abstract    :
              This project will support the production of x-radiographs and digital
              photographs all 1, 363 holotypes, 47 lectotypes, and representatives of 3, 467
              syntypes in the ichthyological collections of the California Academy of
              Sciences.  These radiographs and  photographs will provide a permanent archival
              record of the Academy's primary type holdings of fishes.  At the same time,
              they will be made available as digital images to the user community through the
              Academy's Internet Website.  This has not been done for any other fish
              collection.  Higher-resolution images than those on the Web will be made
              available at no cost in other forms, such as through an anonymous FTP server,
              as an attachment to an email message, as a CD, or as a printout on paper.  The
              ichthyological community will find this service extremely useful and can use
              the images not just as a substitute for the specimens, but also for
              illustrations in their publications.  Sending images rather than specimens will
              reduce the number of primary types loaned out and thus reduce the possibilities
              of irreparable damage or loss of these invaluable specimens.  In the event of
              loss of a type, the ichthyological community will still have graphic records of
              the specimen.
