Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Gary Kinsel of the University of Texas at
              Arlington is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
              Chemistry Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the
              development of a new systematic approach for the study of biomolecular surface
              interaction that forms the core of the matrix-assisted laser desorption
              ionization experiment.  Surfaces are prepared in a number of novel methods,
              including beam approaches, and then the MALDI responses measured in order to
              develop an interpretive framework.  In addition to direct applications to
              improved MALDI analysis, applications to understanding such surface properties
              as contact adsorption and biofouling are envisioned.   The educational aspect
              of the proposal focuses on the development of  laboratory courses and mentoring
              programs under the auspices of a Materials Science program at the
              institution.

The laser-based method of mass spectrometric analysis depends
              on proper sample preparation.  The work described by Gary Kinsel will establish
              the types of interactions between metal surfaces and the protein biomolecules
              often analyzed by laser-based mass spectrometry, and provide the information
              needed for sample preparation leading to higher sensitivity and specificity in
              analysis.
