In  this  project,  the  PIs will continue their  investigation 
              of wintertime  air-sea interaction processes off  the  east  coast  of North
              America, emphasizing the Gulf Stream (GS) region east of Cape Hatteras and the
              coastal region in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Analyses  of  model  results
               will  include  temporal  and  spatial variation  of the air-sea exchanges of
              heat, moisture and momentum, evolution  of  the  oceanic mixed layer and the
              marine  atmospheric boundary  layer  during  storm  passage,  and  momentum, 
              heat  and potential vorticity balances in the ocean.
