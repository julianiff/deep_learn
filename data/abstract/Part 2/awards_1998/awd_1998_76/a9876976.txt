This research focuses on experimental projects that are designed
              to address many-body correlation effects and two-electron dynamics in atoms and
              molecules induced by strong laser fields.  The projects cover one- and
              two-color dissociative ionization of diatomic and triatomic molecules,
              non-sequential double ionization of helium, and the nature of rescattering of
              electrons trapped in the laser field subsequent to strong field ionization. 
              The experiments will capitalize on the availability of image spectrometers that
              capture electrons and ions over 4-pi steradian.
