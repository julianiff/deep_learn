The goal of this project is to develop
              scientific grade CMOS imaging detectors for use in astronomy and other
              scientific disciplines.  These new detectors can complement existing CCD
              technology for such applications as guide cameras, wavefront sensors, and
              high-speed imagers.  As the technology matures, however, CMOS imagers may
              replace CCDs because of their low cost and ease of manufacture on
              state-of-the-art, large area silicon wafers.

The research is focussed into
              three phases.  First, developing a test facility for CMOS imagers, which allows
              direct, quantitative comparison with today's scientific CCD detectors.  Second,
              evaluating existing CMOS devices to obtain their real performance
              characteristics.  And third, developing optimized CMOS imagers for astronomical
              use, including design and fabrication changes, frontside coatings, custom
              packaging, hybridized sensors, and back illuminated processing.  In electronic
              imaging "science kit" will be developed as a prototype educational tool for
              high school students using CMOS imagers and classroom personal computers.
