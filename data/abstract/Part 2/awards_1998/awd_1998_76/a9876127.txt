Abstract    :
                  This research will extend current theories describing how students'
acquire
              an understanding of the function concept, the central concept of
the
              undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The model that emerges will
provide a
              framework for the development of two research instruments to
broadly assess
              students' function knowledge. The Precalculus Concept
Assessment Instrument
              (PCA) and the Calculus Concept Assessment Instrument
(CCA) will provide a
              consistent means of quantifying students' concept
development for two
              large-enrollment undergraduate courses.
     Investigations of students'
              problem solving behavior, using
interviews, case studies and observations will
              attempt to identify major
beliefs and behaviors that both promote and present
              obstacles to students'
mathematical success and continued mathematical study. 
              The results of
these studies will form the basis for the development of a
              framework and
instrument to broadly define and assess undergraduate students'
              beliefs
about knowing and learning mathematics.
     The emergent instruments
              will provide objective means for examining
patterns in students' function
              understandings and mathematical beliefs.
The resultant investigations will
              provide insights for guiding the
development of precalclulus and calculus
              level curriculum modules.  During
the course of this project model workshops
              will also be offered to
disseminate the newly developed instruments and
              curricular materials.
