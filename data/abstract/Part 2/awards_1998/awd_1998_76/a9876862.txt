This project investigates the use of ultrafast lasers to
              generate vibrational states at THz frequencies where both the amplitude and the
              fluctuations, i.e., noise, in the ion motion can be coherently controlled. The
              goals of this research are to provide a full characterization of such (coherent
              and squeezed) states, to elucidate the generation mechanisms in the opaque
              regime, and to develop a capability for attaining high-intensity phonon fields
              for lattice-control purposes. This latter task, focusing on resonant
              excitation, relates to fundamental studies of lattice anharmonic effects and
              potential applications in the areas of ultrafast X-ray modulation and coherent
              annealing of impurities. This project offers excellent opportunities for
              undergraduate and graduate students to acquire skills in materials science and
              state-of-the-art optical techniques.

This project centers on the
              generation of high-frequency vibrations and control of the atomic motion using
              ultrafast lasers. The program covers both fundamental and applied aspects.
              Potential applications include the processing of materials for the
              semiconductor and optoelectronics industry and ultrafast modulation of X-rays
              for time-domain structural studies in a wide range of fields. The research
              offers excellent opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate
              students in a forefront technological field.
