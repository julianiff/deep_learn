              ABSTRACT
9876645

In the near future several new surveys will provide tens of
              terabytes of cataloged data for the astronomy community.  The archives for
              these projects are currently being designed.  The separate archives from the
              surveys need to be integrated into a seamlessly interoperating entity.  This
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research will investigate a concept for
              accomplishing this: a national "virtual observatory."   The community would
              interact with the virtual observatory in much the same way that it now
              interacts with space-based observatories, or in queue and remote observing at
              ground-based observatories.  This grant will provide a forum for the community
              to discuss the concept of a virtual observatory, which integrates the archives
              of several large surveys and provides access to the survey results for the
              community.
