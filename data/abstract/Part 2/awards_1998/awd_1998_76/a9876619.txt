Digital Government: A Web-Based Query System for Disclosure-Limited
              Statistical Analysis of Confidential Data

Working with several Federal
              statistical agencies, this grant will address an important topic for Federal
              statistical agencies.  As part of their missions, these agencies collect a
              great deal of microdata (data related to an individual or particular business);
              this data must remain confidential.  Thus, only aggregated microdata is
              provided publicly.  However, the aggregation process reduces much of the value
              of the microdata for deriving knowledge to be used in research, policy and
              commercial purposes, so there is a balancing need to provide as much data as
              possible.  What is proposed here is a large-scale system which tracks the
              history of provision of derived data and which "understands" and can quantify
              the potential for working backward from the derived data of confidential
              microdata.
