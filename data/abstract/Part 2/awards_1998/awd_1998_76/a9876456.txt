This project explores what appear to be deep and surprising
              connections 
between two areas of linguistic structure that are superficially
              quite 
diverse: on the one hand, clitic elements (such as Romance pronominals)
              and on 
the other, formal markers of the properties of words ("morphemes").  A
              theory 
of the structure of words and of their relations to one another,
              developed in 
previous research by the PI, has as one important component the
              claim that 
clitics serve a function within the phrase which is closely
              parallel to that 
filled by affixes (and other morphological markers) within
              words. This 
research develops and explores the consequences of that
              observation.

Clitic systems may involve the interaction of many areas of
              grammar, as in 
Tagalog, where independent principles of syntax, phonology,
              and phrasal 
morphology combine to yield an intricate set of patterns. This
              research will 
enrich our understanding of a number of areas of linguistic
              structure 
(phonology, morphology and syntax) and their inter-relation, as
              well as 
refinements in a range of current linguistic theories. As a
              by-product of 
research into these theoretical questions, the project will
              also result in 
descriptive studies of languages with rich but poorly
              documented systems of 
clitics, such as Kurdish and Breton.
