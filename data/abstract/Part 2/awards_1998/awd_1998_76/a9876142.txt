Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports research and education on allosterism in transition metal
              complexes by Dr. Marc W. Perkovic of the Chemistry Department, Western Michigan
              University.  Allosterism is a phenomenon in which structural change in one
              molecule is induced by introduction of another molecule, ion, or molecular
              fragment.  Novel ligands that simultaneously induce a structural change in the
              primary coordination site and coordinate a photophysically active transition
              metal and a photophysically benign metal ion will be synthesized.  The effect
              of the allosteric interaction on the d-orbital energies of the photophysically
              active transition metal will be determined using luminescence and transient
              absorbance methods. The project will determine if metal complexes can function
              as luminescent indicators for other photophysically quiet ions. 

Systems
              using these allosteric interactions will be useful as molecular-level chemical
              sensors to detect environmentally-unfriendly traces of toxic and heavy metal
              ions or otherwise unfriendly molecules. The method involves changes in the
              luminescence of the sensor as these metal ions interact with the sensor. The
              educational component  of this CAREER Award presents innovative ideas on how to
              bring laser-based experiments into several existing laboratory courses in order
              to introduce undergraduate students to laser technology. Of particular
              interest, undergraduates will build parts of the laser equipment in one
              laboratory course to be subsequently used in another course. In so doing,
              students will have a better comprehension of lasers.
