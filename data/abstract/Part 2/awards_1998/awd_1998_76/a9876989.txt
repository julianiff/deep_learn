This award funds a broad research program in the area of precision
              measurements based on techniques of optical cooling and atom interferometry.
              Underlying the measurements will be the continued development of experimental
              techniques to speed up the cooling process and to achieve much higher coherence
              times in optical traps. Applications include an improved measurement of h/M and
              G and a search for the electric dipole moment of the electron.
