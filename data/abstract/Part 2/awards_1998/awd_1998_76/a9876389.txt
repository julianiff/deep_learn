Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Andrei G. Kutateladze of the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry at the University of Denver.   His research is aimed at designing
              improved organic synthetic methods based on electron transfer- induced cleavage
              of substituted alpha-hydroxyalkyl dithianes.   These dithianes (cyclic
              compounds containing two sulfur atoms) are used to protect carbonyl groups
              (C=O) during the synthesis of complex organic compounds, and have the novel
              property of being readily removed with light.
The PI believes strongly in
              integrating education and research, and involves students in a wide variety of
              research activities including synthesis, photochemistry and photophysics,
              nuclear magnetic resonance, materials science, theoretical chemistry, and
              computer programming.   His educational activities under this grant include
              developing one freshman/sophomore level organic course and two advanced
              courses, utilizing multimedia, computer simulation/animation, and molecular
              modeling.   The PI encourages his graduate students to participate in local
              high school Science Fairs, and will participate in a departmental summer
              research program for area high school chemistry teachers.
