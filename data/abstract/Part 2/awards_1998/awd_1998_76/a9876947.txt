The principal investigator will study the mathematical
              problems of fluid 
motion. Methods of Littlewood-Paley theory and wavelets
              will be used to 
study weak singularities for the incompressible flows of an
              ideal fluid. The 
basic nonstationary problem for the Euler equations will be
              investigated in 
function classes with, generally, essentially unbounded
              vorticity. He will 
address the problem of linear vector transport by flows
              that are less than 
regular. These aspects of transport theory are directly
              applicable to 
questions of existence and uniqueness for the Euler
              equations.

The mathematical theory of fluid motion is fundamental both for
              
applications in meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics and within
              
mathematics itself. Most of the flows in nature such as ocean currents, or
              
hurricanes, or the motion of matter in a galaxy, are highly irregular. The
              
origin and evolution of singular structures such as rapid oscillations of a
              
flow are still not well understood. In addition to this, numerical modelling
              
of irregular flows is limited by instabilities due to the small scale
              
structures constantly produced by the flow.  The PI will investigate two
              
related aspects of this subject. First, the basic mathematical nature of the
              
flows with singularities. Second, transport of quantities such as the
              
magnetic field by irregular flows in the solar photosphere.
