Abstract    :
              Reaction pathways synthesis has the ability to produce environmentally benign
              processes with a lower overall associated risk factor both for human health and
              environment.  In this project a versatile reaction pathway generation method
              will be developed for use as a pollution prevention design tool.  The reaction
              pathways generated by this method may allow a wider range of environmentally
              benign reactions to be carried out at minimal cleanup and disposal costs
              through efficient use of intermediates.  Extnesions of the work include design
              for easily separable intermediates, applications to reaction engineering, and
              incorporation of kinetics.  Two major approaches to reaction pathway synthesis
              will be developed and compared: optimization and construction (lexicographic
              technique).  Previous work demonstrated the pronciple of automatic,
              thermodynamically feasible, reaction cluster generation.  This technique will
              be reined to improve its utility and computational speed through an aggregate
              mathematical formulation and a computationally efficient algorighm.  In
              parallel the construction approach to reaction pathways will be pursued.  These
              technqiues have the power to design for reactions based on safety and toxicity
              considerations, explicitly incorporating risk informaiton into design
              procedure.
