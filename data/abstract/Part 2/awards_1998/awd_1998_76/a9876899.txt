This award supports a project to measure experimentally, to
              high precision, the bound state g-factor of one or more hydrogen-like high-Z
              ions, the ground state hyperfine structure splitting of these ions, and the
              lifetimes of the hyperfine structure magnetic dipole transitions.  These
              measurements, by focusing on the simplicity of the hydrogen-like high-Z ions,
              are designed to test the results of current ab initio theories of atomic
              structure, particularly the influence of relativistic and QED effects.  The
              experiments will be performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory using
              the EBIT ion source and the Penning ion trap, RETRAP.
