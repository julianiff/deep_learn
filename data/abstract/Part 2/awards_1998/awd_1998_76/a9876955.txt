Abstract    :
              This grant will continue support for the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              at Hope College.  A key factor in the program is the close professional
              partnership between the student and faculty mentor, which covers active
              involvement in planning experiments, doing experiments, and interpretation of
              results for presentation and/or publication.  Each participant will spend ten
              weeks (minimum of 40 hours/week) during the summer on research activities.  The
              students will work with a mentor in a broad spectrum of research areas
              supported within the department (heavy-ion physics, nuclear theory, theoretical
              astrophysics, science education, and material properties).  The projects are
              designed to introduce students to a variety of topics and techniques, as well
              as provide experience in the selection of a research problem, the design of
              experiments and equipment, the analysis data, and interpretation in light of
              models and theory.  Communication skills will be emphasized by the presentation
              of student seminars at the beginning and end of the ten week period and the
              preparation of final written report.
