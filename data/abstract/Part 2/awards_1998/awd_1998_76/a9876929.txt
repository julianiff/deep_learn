The topic of this research is atom optics that can be
              dynamically reconfigured on time scales as short as a microsecond.  The goal of
              the research is to increase the availability and simplicity of the appropriate
              atom optical elements, which will allow a number of new experimental
              possibilities.  These include uncertainty limited atomic distributions with
              widths less than 10 nm, time dependent mirrors that compress atoms in both
              position and velocity space, atom interferometers with areas greater than one
              cm by one cm, and controlled collisions between atoms confined in potentials
              smaller than their scattering length.
