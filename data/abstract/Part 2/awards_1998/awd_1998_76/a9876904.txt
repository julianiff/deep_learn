Unified Object and Image Representation in 3D Frequency
              Domain

The proposed research is to develop a frequency domain object
              representation and related methodology for  several major vision  problems. 
              Specifically, a volumetric frequency domain object representation (VFR)
              introduced by the PI will be used, which encapsulates both viewer centered and
              object centered  representations. The VFR includes a continuum of the views of
              the objects as 2-D slices of  the original  representation. This  view
              representation is based on the Fourier Slice Theorem. Previous frequency  
              domain representations were developed  for  two dimensional images and did not
              consider the three  dimensional object structure. Conventional  2-D frequency
              domain or spatial domain image representations for vision tasks is limited to
              2-D interpretation. On the other hand,  the proposed approach considers  the 
              full  three dimensional object structure and  therefore can  handle  diverse 
              problems  such  as  viewpoint or
illumination independent  recognition, 
              articulated  3-D motion, etc.  The VFR includes not only a continuum of object
              appearances but also 3-D structural information. Thus, 3-D object structure can
              be  derived  from  single images.  Pose  invariant  and  illumination 
              invariant object  recognition can be implemented using the VFR by directly
              indexing  into a complex  (real and imaginary) volumetric eigenvector  space.
              Two approaches  are  proposed  for  motion estimation.  The result  would be
              either a temporal sequence of  3-D poses  which  explicitly  define  the motion
              or a 3-D motion flow field. This 3-D approach avoids the problems of 2-D flow
              fields, especially  in the estimation of 3-D rotational motions where the
              actual motion vectors exhibit themselves as projections onto the image plane. 
              It is also planned to extend the VFR model towards several vision applications,
              such as image segmentation based  on 3-D  structure, pose invariant and
              illumination invariant object and face recognition, 3-D surface recovery  from 
              single image and  articulated motion recognition.
