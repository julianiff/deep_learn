Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Applications involve
              virtual manufacturing and materials processing, on-line EEG data analysis using
              nonlinear methods, long-term study of TCP/IP (Internet) based applications on
              high-speed satellite networks; data transfer of nuclear and particle physics
              research being conducted on an international level between Ohio University and
              the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator facility. Collaborating institutions
              include NASA Lewis Research Center, the Jefferson Lab, and the Children's
              Medical Center in Cincinnati.
