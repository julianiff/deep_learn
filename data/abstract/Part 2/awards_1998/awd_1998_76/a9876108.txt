Title: CAREER:  Bird Migration, Spatial Memory and the
              Hippocampus

The hippocampus is a brain area that has been linked to memory
              for spatial information in birds and mammals, including humans.  Bird migration
              is one of the most spectacular achievements of spatial navigation known in the
              natural world.  Thus, it seems likely that the hippocampus plays an essential
              role in bird migration.  Dr. Cristol's research follows three experimental
              avenues to determine if the hippocampus is involved in bird migration:  (1) a
              comparison between the brains of migratory and non-migratory birds, (2) a
              behavioral study comparing the memory abilities of these same birds, and (3) a
              field experiment to determine whether differences in brain anatomy and memory
              translate into differing abilities to return home after a simulated migration
              journey.

The avian hippocampus has the remarkable capacity to enlarge
              through growth of new nerve cells at times of year when more spatial memory is
              needed. This phenomenon, change in the size of adult brains, offers hope of
              someday understanding how human brains might recover after aging or injury. Dr.
              Cristol's research will also improve our understanding of what the hippocampus
              does, when its nerve cells change, and how the shape and size of brain areas
              relate to important behaviors such as bird migration.  The educational
              component of this project is multifaceted. Among its activities, it will
              incorporate 2 to 4 undergraduates per year in observation of bird migration and
              social interactions in bird flocks, will involve students in the study of
              hippocampal anatomy, will provide outreach to local high schools, and will
              develop a listserver for use by any interested scientist who wishes to enroll.
