Experiments will be undertaken to explore the quantum
              mechanical nature of a macroscopic variable -- in this case the magnetic flux F
              linking a SQUID (a superconducting loop containing a Josephson junction). A
              particular focus of this work will be to understand the effects of the
              environment (damping and temperature) on the evolution of F from purely
              classical to quantum behavior as seen in the switching of the SQUID between two
              fluxoid wells by tunneling through a potential barrier. The system energy can
              be quantized into discrete levels within each of these macroscopically distinct
              fluxoid wells. During tunneling, the magnetic moment of the system flips,
              changing by about 1010 mB --- a very macroscopic quantity. Thus these
              experiments will represent a physical realization of the famous Schrodinger's
              cat paradox resulting from the coherent superposition of macroscopically
              distinct states. Additionally, the experiments will permit controlled tests of
              the underlying theory for the interaction of quantum systems with their
              environment, which is applicable to many physical systems: microscopic as well
              as macroscopic. This work will be carried out as coupled research projects
              between SUNY Stony Brook and the University of Kansas. Initially, work at
              Kansas will focus on development of new microwave techniques for measurement of
              Rabi oscillations and at Stony Brook on the extension of previous techniques as
              well as new sample fabrication. Data and analysis will be shared between
              groups.

              effects of interactions with surrounding matter on the evolution of F from
              purely classical to quantum behavior as seen in the switching of the magnetic
              moment of the loop due to quantum mechanical tunneling. During tunneling, the
              magnetic moment of the system flips, changing by about ten billion times that
              of a single electron --- a very macroscopic quantity. Coherent oscillations of
              the flux will demonstrate purely quantum behavior. Additionally, the
              experiments will permit controlled tests of the underlying theory for the
              interaction of quantum systems with their environment, which is applicable to
              many physical systems: microscopic as well as macroscopic. This work will be

              and analysis will be shared between groups. Students will receive extensive
              training both in fundamental physics and a variety of state-of-the-art
              techniques such as electronic measurements and sample fabrication, which will
              prepare them for both academic and industrial careers.
