Title:  "Multi-Disciplinary Workshop on
              the Biodeterioration of Construction Materials" 


The durability of
              construction materials often depends on their resistance to the natural
              tendencies of microorganisms to break down organized materials to a more
              disorganized state.  These activities are often called biodeterioration and
              result in damage to many civil infrastructure facilities.  The objectives of
              this award are to hold a workshop to examine the current state of
              biodeterioration science and engineering and to discuss the future needs and
              opportunities for research.  The workshop will be held during October, 1999 in
              Houston, Texas at the Hilton on the University of Houston campus. 

The
              specific objectives of the workshop are to: 
1) Identify the construction
              materials that are susceptible to biodeterioration and a) the rate of
              deterioration of the materials, b) the organisms and environmenta that cause
              the deterioration, c) the protective measures that prevent or slow down
              deterioration, and d) the direction for further study of the biodeterioration
              of construction materials. 
2) Establish the tools and technology available to
              aid the continued research efforts. 
3) Discuss teaching tools to incorporate
              this information into current engineering and microbiology courses.
