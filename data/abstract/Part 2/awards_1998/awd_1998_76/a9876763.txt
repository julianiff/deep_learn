This is a low temperature physics project dealing with
              helium adsorbed on solid surfaces. Various phases of quasi two-dimensional
              (2-d) matter, as occurring in films adsorbed on solid surfaces, are studied
              with thermodynamic and neutron scattering techniques. Liquid mixtures of 3He
              and 4He are measured below 0.2K to search for 2-d phase separation, and solid
              mixtures of D2-Ne are investigated between 2K and 20K to search for and study
              mixing, solidification, and 2-d eutectic points. New adsorbing surfaces are
              developed to explore changes in the freezing point of 2-d H2 which may lead to
              a new superfluid. Neutron scattering measurements on solid films containing
              deuterium and/or liquid films with deuterium hydride complement the
              thermodynamic measurements yielding the structure of solids and the mobility of
              liquids. The fast freezing of relatively thick uniform films explores the
              parameters which control the supercooling of liquids.

This low
              temperature physics project studies gaseous, liquid, and solid films, one to a
              few atomic or molecular layers thick, formed by atoms and/or molecules which
              wet solid surfaces. Results of measurements yield information on atomic
              mobilities, mixing and unmixing of different components, fabrication of new
              surfaces to produce mobile films, wetting of surfaces by certain fluids, and
              supercooling in pure and mixture liquid films. Thermodynamic measurements are
              carried out by graduate and undergraduate students at the University of
              Washington with experiments designed and built in house, while neutron
              scattering measurements are done at Saclay and Grenoble in collaboration with
              foreign scientists.  Graduate students participate in the international
              experiments. This work trains students in refrigeration, modern data
              acquisition methods, high vacuum technology, measurements on very small samples
              (nanotechnology), and surface analysis tools.
