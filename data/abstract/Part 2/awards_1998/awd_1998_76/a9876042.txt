The research program under this CAREER award seeks to
              elucidate the relative importance of
electronic pathways of energy dissipation
              associated with interfacial friction.  It involves the fundamental measurement
              on an atomic scale of frictional forces present at the surface of atomically
              clean metals and conducting oxides.  The studies will entail measurements of
              friction for single asperity contacts under conditions in which the chemical,
              phonon, and electron structure of the interface is well understood. The work
              will establish the conditions under which frictional energy can be dissipated
              through the excitation of electrons of the contacting bodies.
	
The
              educational activities involve the development of an undergraduate introductory
              chemistry curriculum designed specifically for engineering students. Both
              lecture and laboratory resources will be developed which focus on an atomic or
              molecular view of materials and their relation to physical properties. The
              objective of this effort is to meet the currently changing curriculum needs of
              the chemistry and engineering programs at the introductory college
              level.
