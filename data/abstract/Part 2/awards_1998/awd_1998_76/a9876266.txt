This CAREER project is an integrated research and education effort
              on spin-injection in perovskite ferromagnetic(FM)/paramagnetic(PM)
              heterostructures in order to investigate the spin transport and polarized-spin
              effects in a PM layer.  The focus is on two main areas: the study, in the
              superconducting state, of the interaction of the injjected spins with a
              superconducting condensate and, in the normal state, the spin diffusion and
              spin conductivity.  The results of these studies will be measured values of the
              spin diffusion length, the relaxation time T2, and the spin resistance for
              high-Tc superconducting materials. Graduate students and postdoctoral research
              associates will be trained in forefront areas of condensed matter
              physics/materials science to constitute the next generation of researchers and
              engineers for the 21st Century.   Linkages will be developed between research
              and education, the main emphasis being the improvement of the introductory
              physics course.

This CAREER project involves both a research and an
              education plan.  The research will be focused on as yet unstudied properties of
              the behavior of electrons in technologically important materials.  Graduate
              students and postdoctoral research associates will be trained in forefront
              areas of condensed matter physics/materials science to constitute the next
              generation of researchers and engineers for the 21st Century.  The education
              plan tries to build a linkage between research and education.  The teaching
              activities include a focus on the improvement of introductory physics courses
              with an active learning component and introduction of actual research
              experience into an undergraduate laboratory course.
