Geophysical and astrophysical plasmas have characteristics
              which vary from point to point.  The objective of this research is to perform
              basic laboratory experiments which investigate some of the effects of plasma
              non-uniformities. The experiments are conducted in a Q-machine and focus on how
              electrostatic shock waves develop when plasma density pulses are launched into
              converging magnetic field lines and how ion-acoustic fluctuations are produced
              by magnetic field currents if a non-uniform magnetic field-aligned bulk plasma
              flow is also present.
