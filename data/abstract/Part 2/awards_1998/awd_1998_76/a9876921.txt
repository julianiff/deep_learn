                     Ordonez                                                                 
                                                                                             
                               The objective of this research is to perform time-dependent
              numerical simulations which demonstrate how to get two oppositely charged
              plasmas to overlap in the same spatial region when trapped in a solenoidal
              field.  The numerical results are needed for a future experiment intended to
              produce cold antihydrogen in a nested-well plasma trap at CERN.
