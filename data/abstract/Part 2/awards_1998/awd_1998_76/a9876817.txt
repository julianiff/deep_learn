Abstract    :
              Herpetological collections rarely curate prenatal life history stages of
              reptiles.  Since 1984 a significant collection of embryonic and neonatal
              reptiles has been built at Old Dominion University (ODU).  To date holdings
              include 6,717 embryos and neonates belonging to six families, 31 genera, and 59
              species of squamate reptiles.  Over 700 additional specimens are associated
              with the embryo collection; most are females (dams) from which eggs or embryos
              in the collection were obtained.

The collection and curation of vertebrate
              embryos requires a considerable investment of time and resources.  The
              reptilian embryo collection at ODU is likely the largest collection of its kind
              in existence, and the effort that has gone into its establishment is unlikely
              to be duplicated.  Furthermore, the collection merits wider recognition among,
              and use by, other researchers.  Indeed, several individuals have either
              borrowed material or visited the collection at ODU.  However, before the
              material can be made more widely available to the research community the
              collection data must be transferred from a paper catalog to an electronic 
              format.  A computerized catalog would allow more efficient management of the
              process of preparing loans.  The  collection also requires upgrading of the
              condition of the utility cabinets (for embryos) and buckets (for dams)in which
              most of the specimens currently are housed.  This project would bring all
              specimens up to the highest curatorial standards, including housing all
              specimens in appropriate cabinets or tanks.
