Abstract    :
              Christopher J. Grayce is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop a
              mesoscopic treatment of solvent influence on general models of polymer
              association, conformational transition and slow dynamics.  Density functional
              theoretical techniques, along with geometric theories of solvation, will be
              used to construct solvent influence functionals.  Grayce's teaching plan
              involves both graduate and undergraduate contributions.  At the graduate level
              he will develop a more comprehensive, fully modern graduate program in
              statistical mechanics of complex systems.  At the undergraduate level he plans
              to put the insight accessible from direct computer simulation into the hands of
              freshman and physical chemistry students.

In biological systems water
              solvation plays a well-recognized role in the folding of proteins and in
              molecular recognition and binding.  Industrial polymers are commonly dissolved
              in or swollen by a variety of solvents during synthesis, processing or end use,
              and key engineering properties such as solubility, rate and degree of swelling,
              surface activity, diffusion rate and viscosity all depend strongly on solvent
              influence.  Grayce's research will attempt to describe solvent influence in
              polymer systems by statistical mechanical theory grounded in exact microscopic
              equations of motion and / or microscopically realistic interatomic potentials.
