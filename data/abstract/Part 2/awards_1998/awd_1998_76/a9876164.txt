The goal of this NSF Career award is to synthesis and
              characterize novel nanoparticles by Alkalide/Electride reduction.  The
              nucleation and growth of the particles will be studied by stopped-flow
              spectroscopy.  Parameters which affect mean size and polydispersity will be
              investigated.  This data will be essential to extend the method to "shell-core"
              bi-metal particle synthesis and large scale flow synthesis.  The reductions
              will be extended to higher order phases, specifically binary non-oxide
              ceramics.  This work will be part of a program of strong integration of
              research and coursework in materials chemistry for undergraduates. 
              Additionally, the PI will begin to develop a more unified approach to Physical
              Chemistry laboratory, in which experiments are strongly linked within the
              context of the lab and with the lecture to provide continuity of learning. 
              Senior undergraduates interested in chemical education will help design and
              implement the course.  Finally, the PI will continue his active role as a
              Freshman Workshop leader, mentoring students prior to their choice of major,
              easing the transition to college and putting a "human" face on
              science.

Alkalide/electride reduction is an uniquely powerful method of
              synthesizing nanomaterials, general across the entire periodic table.  This
              homogeneous solution phase method overcomes the slow interdiffusion typical of
              solid state synthesis at ambient and below, and thus is not limited to high
              temperature, thermodynamic phases.  The research proposed here promises not
              only to make technologically important materials in the short term, but the
              methodology developed may open the door to a vast array of as yet undiscovered
              novel metastable and low temperature thermodynamically stable materials.
