Abstract    :
              The goal - so far not entirely realized - of synthetic environments is
              to
provide a realistic experience for their users. In particular,
              these
environments can be used for active collaboration on engineering
              designs
and medical applications.  This project attacks some of the most
              important
outstanding problems in the field of real-time synthetic
              environments:

1) Develop a scalable system to achieve real-time walkthrough
              of very large
CAD models with high-accuracy rendering of spatial
              arrangements.

2) Develop parallel rendering algorithms that take into
              account emerging
graphics architectures with multiple graphics pipelines and
              general-purpose
processors.

3) Develop incremental algorithms to allow
              interactive updates to large
dynamic environments, allowing objects to be
              moved, added, and removed in
realistic manners.

Among the algorithms that
              the project will explore are visibility culling,
multi-resolution methods,
              model simplification, image-based rendering,3-D
image warping, multi-pass
              rendering, and efficient updates for model
hierarchies, occlusion databases,
              and level-of-detail generation. These
advances will be tested on real-world
              models, including a 13
million-element polygonal model of an electric
              generating station.
