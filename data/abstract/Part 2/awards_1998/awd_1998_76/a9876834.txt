Abstract    :
              





Alaska is not simply another geopolitical unit in North America. 
              Faunistically, including birds, there is no other region of its type on the
              planet.  It hosts a diverse New World and old World avifauna, as well as a
              uniquely Beringian avifauna.  Historically, other museums have been important
              in documenting the avian diversity of this remarkable region, but in the late
              twentieth century these activities have been conducted almost exclusively by
              the University of Alaska Museum (UAM).

In 1997 the UAM bird collection grew
              by 1,000 specimens, or by 14%.  This growth rate will be sustained or exceeded
              for the foreseeable future, and probably ranks UAM among the top 10-12
              institutions in North America in collections growth.  If one counts objects
              preserved, rather than individuals, then the growth rate is larger.  The great
              majority of specimens being added today are prepared as skins, partial
              skeletons, tissue samples, and stomach contents - five separate pieces for each
              individual.  The collection is fully computerized, and the cataloguing process
              involves entering each specimen acquired directly into the computer database. 
              At present specimen holdings exceed the space available in cases.  The skeleton
              collection and some of the lesser-used skin material are currently being stored
              in cardboard boxes on top of cases in the bird range.  Because there is no
              available collection expansion space in cases, not all of holdings can be
              placed in taxonomic order.  None of these problems is acceptable for an active
              systematics collection, and all of them can be alleviated with new cases.  This
              project will support the purchase of new cases, which are anticipated to
              satisfy needs for the next 3-5 years.
