Abstract    :
              Hofmann    
The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Program (GLOBEC) seeks to understand
              how climate variability affects the distribution, abundance, production and
              population dynamics of zooplankton and fish in the sea. The approach is to
              develop a fundamental understanding of how physical and biological processes
              interact to control the population dynamics of marine animals, with a focus on
              those animals that spend all or some of their lives as plankton. Through
              several key international meetings, the scientific community developed the
              intellectual themes for the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program. The program has been
              developed with a focus on Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, as the primary
              target species. The focus on krill includes the habitat, prey, predators and
              competitors of this species. There will be a year-round field program, with a
              particular emphasis on winter processes. Two research sites were selected by
              the international community; the US will focus its efforts in the Antarctic
              Peninsula area. This workshop will bring together US scientists to focus the
              broader scientific issues into an implementation plan. Participants will
              include polar and non-polar scientists and will produce a web-based report that
              will be made available to the broader scientific community.
