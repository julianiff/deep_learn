Abstract    :
              Seventh West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar
This is a proposal for partial
              participant support for the Seventh West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar to be
              held at California State University, San Bernardino,  California on October 16
              and 17, 1998.  

The West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS) has become a
              tradition among the operator algebraists living in the western states of United
              States and Canada.  The seminar has been quite invaluable in reinforcing the
              ties between the various schools, and giving young researchers, graduate
              students and postdocs, a forum where to present their latest results and
              discuss it with senior mathematicians.  The high concentration of operator
              algebraists in the west coast of the United States and Canada has been one of
              the main reasons for the success of the WCOAS conferences.
