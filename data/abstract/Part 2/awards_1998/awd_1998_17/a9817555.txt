Our goals are to reduce entry barriers for MGE,
              enhance degree completion, generate leaders for
SME careers, and create a
              culture that welcomes diversity.  MGE has been limited by the numbers of
              students qualified for admission under current GRE standards and by inadequate
              measures to retain enrolled students.  We will develop alternate strategies to
              identify students who can succeed in graduate study and will generate outcome
              data to address concerns.  Outreach to students in minority and majority
              institutions and opportunities for participation in summer programs are
              designed to provide undergraduate exposure to research and graduate education
              and to create an environment conducive for MGE.  Clusters, modeled after the
              successful Spend a Summer with a Scientist program, will be expanded across
              science and engineering at Rice University and established in engineering at
              University of Wisconsin-Madison to provide a year-round community experience
              that encourages enrollment, supports degree completion, and exposes students to
              rigorous academic discipline.  Outside evaluation will determine factors that
              affect application of this model in different settings.     Together with
              strong institutional commitments by Rice University and UW-M, this proposal is
              designed to alter the culture of the institutions so that the fundamental
              change continues past the life of the project.
