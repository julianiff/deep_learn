Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. Stephen DiMagno, Department of
              Chemistry, University of Nebraska - Lincoln to develop two new tunable classes
              of ligands, namely the beta-octafluoroporphyrins and the porphodimethenes,
              which will lead to a new series of metallo-porphyrins and
              metallo-porphodimethene complexes having unusual electronic properties. The
              repertoire of these ligand classes will be expanded and the spectroscopic,
              photophysical, electrochemical and catalytic properties of the resulting
              metal-chelates will be examined.

This is a novel and wide ranging study
              involving new strategies to synthesize new ligands. The work will also exploit
              the ligand's conformational dynamics to synchronize delivery of redox
              equivalents and acidic or basic functionality to the metal centers. Results of
              these studies will contribute significantly to the interdisciplines of
              chemistry that broadly impact on environmental, economic and educational
              issues. Undergraduate and graduate students will get sound training in this
              state-of-the-art field of chemistry.
