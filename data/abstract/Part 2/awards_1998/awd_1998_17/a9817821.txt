                                        ABSTRACT                                              
                          OCE-9817821      It  has  only  been  within the past four years 
              that  ocean  scientists have verified that the ultratrace amounts of iron 
              dissolved   in   surface  seawater  may   limit   biological  production 
              throughout  vast regions  of  the  world  ocean,  particularly  those 
              low-production  regions  far  from  the  continents where other nutrients (like
              nitrogen and  silica)  seem  to  be  in excess.  Since verification  of  the 
              "iron  hypothesis" in the Western Equatorial Pacific by  this  team  of 
              investigators and their colleagues - the  IronEx  I  and  IronEx  II 
              experiments - there has been excited speculation  that  the major oceanic
              region where iron limitation  should  occur  is  the  Southern  Ocean,
              particularly  in  the  high  latitudes near Antarctica.  The purpose of this
              award is  to  support  a  planning and evaluation workshop for a  Southern 
              Ocean  "IronEx III".  The list of invited participants  will  include 
              virtually  the entire community  of  American  iron  biogeochemistry  experts
              as well as their top  international  counterparts.
