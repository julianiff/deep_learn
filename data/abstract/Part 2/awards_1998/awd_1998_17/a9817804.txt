This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              involves the acquisition of the newly developed Flow Cytometer and Microscope
              (FlowCAM), and initial testing by the ocean science community.  The FlowCAM has
              the potential to greatly enhance on-going research in at least three funded
              projects at the Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC), thus making the Center a
              good site for the early "user community" testing of the FlowCAM. FlowCAM has
              been designed to examine planktonic algal and protozoan populations in
              relatively dilute suspensions.  It combines scattering and fluorescence
              information with video analysis of cells passing the imaging path by using a
              novel lens which allows automated imaging of single cells in a broad focal
              plane. It allows quick and accurate counts of cell populations, it obtains size
              spectra, and examines fluorescent properties during grazing experiments at
              realistically low cell concentrations.
