Abstract    :
              This Project is a component of the InterLib collaboration between University of
              California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and
              Stanford University.  The combined interLib technologies will be demonstrated
              on the emerging California Digital Library (CDL), and on a testbed developed by
              the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The Project will  attempt to develop
              tools and technologies that support highly improved models of information
              dissemination and access.  A goal is to facilitate moving from the current
              centralized, discrete publishing model, to a distributed, continuous,
              self-publishing model, while at the same time preserving and enhancing the best
              aspects of the current model.  In the envisioned model, information can be
              disseminated prior to publishing; it can be disseminated and composed
              continually; it will also have a significant non-textual data component.  The
              model is consistent with the changing economics of academic publishing, yet has
              the potential to drastically alter the cost structure of scholarly information
              dissemination.

To promote such an improved paradigm, it is planned to (i)
              develop a set of enabling technologies, (ii) develop  related technologies that
              exploit the paradigm to support functionality not readily available in the
              traditional model, (iii) experimentally develop publishing models and digital
              collections in line with the new paradigm, (iv) conduct studies on economic
              models of alternative information paradigms, and (v) conduct user studies to
              help evaluate the impact of the work.
