The Madison School District is planning and testing
              strategies to help teachers implement a standards-based curriculum.  Pilot
              testing of Investigations in Data, Number, and Space at the elementary school
              level and Connected Mathematics at the middle-school level continues for
              teacher leaders.  Plans are developed for including all teachers in making a
              transition from a traditional curriculum to a standards-based approach based on
              the materials being piloted.  Issues being addressed in the planning phase
              include implementation, professional development, and uses of available
              resources such as Title I and Eisenhower funds.
