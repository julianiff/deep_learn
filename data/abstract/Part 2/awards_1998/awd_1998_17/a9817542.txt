Abstract    :
              HRD-9817542

  The University of Michigan seeks support from the National
              Science Foundation
  for a major effort to re-engineer the processes for
              recruiting and mentoring
  doctoral students in the physical and life
              sciences, engineering, and
  mathematics.  We seek NSF funding for four
              specific activities that will make a
  critical difference in the creation and
              establishment of new models.  The first two
  are directed to the cultivation
              stage.  The third is a pilot project for a fellowship
  program that bridges
              recruiting to graduate mentoring.  Finally, we ask
  assistance in supporting
              an innovative scheme to provide faculty leadership for

  The four activities
              are

1.	An applications-oriented Summer Mathematics Workshop to
              facilitate
	inquiry-based learning.

2.	Expanded opportunities for students
              at other universities to have a
            meaningful summer research
              experience at the University of
            Michigan.

3. 	A Fellowships to
              Faculty pilot to encourage individual faculty
            initiative in
              recruiting minority students.

4. 	A Faculty Leadership Committee, reporting
              to the Provost and the
            Principal Investigator and Co-Principal
              Investigators, that will review
            activities and progress within SEM
              departments, approve pilot projects
            for improving recruitment and
              retention of minority students, and assist
            and advise SEM
              departments and the Graduate School on the
