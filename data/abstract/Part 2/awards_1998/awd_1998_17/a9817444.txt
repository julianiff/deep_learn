DLI Phase 2 - DATA PROVENANCE
	
This project will
              address issues associated with data provenance. Provenance is concerned with
              how information has arrived at the form in which appears -who produced it, who
              has corrected it, how old it is,    it was originally produced, and so forth . 
              Understanding provenance has occupied scientists, historians, textual critics
              and other scholars for centuries.

The provenance of data in databases is a
              newer and larger problem, because one is interested in data at all levels of
              granularity - from a single pixel in a digital image to a whole database.  Just
              as scholars comment on documents by attaching annotations (marginalia) to text,
              part of the solution to recording provenance is the attachment of annotations
              to components of databases.  Database researchers have recently
              considered
loosely structured forms of data and have developed software
              systems for querying and storing such data. This work is closely related to new
              formats that have been developed for structured documents on the Web.  It is
              expected that this technology will provide the substrate for recording and
              tracking provenance by advancing new data models, new query languages and new
              storage techniques.
