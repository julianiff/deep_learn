This award provides funds to rescue the National Archive of
              the Albanian Lexicon, which has been undergoing severe physical deterioration
              since the end of the Communist regime in 1991. The archive, consisting of an
              estimated 5,000,000 data cards, was created under extraordinary political and
              linguistic circumstances that can never be reproduced, and its loss would be
              irreparable and deleterious for any future study of the language and to studies
              that call upon contemporary, historical, comparative, or dialectal Albanian
              data. The rescue begins with capture of the data cards as scanned images onto
              CD ROM disks. Duplicate disks will be brought to the University of California,
              San Diego, for transfer into permanent electronic form. After the images are
              indexed, the duplicate archive will be generally available for scholarly
              purposes.
