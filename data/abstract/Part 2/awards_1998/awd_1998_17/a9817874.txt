Load dependent Ritz vectors or Lanczos vectors
              represent an alternative to mode shape vectors as suitable basis vectors for
              n-dimensional space. Ritz vectors have been used extensively in the areas of
              model reduction, component mode synthesis, eigensystem computation, and
              transient response prediction.

The experimental determination of Ritz
              properties has long eluded the test engineer.  This Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) award will provide a validated theory and methodology to
              extract Ritz properties from measured dynamic test data and a methodology for
              utilization of these properties in structural health monitoring of large scale
              structures.  The developed theory will address both the traditional dynamic
              test where input forces are measured and the practical case of ambient data
              analysis for situations when forces cannot be measured.

Upon completion of
              the research, the field of structural engineering will have the ability to be
              able to utilize experimental Ritz properties in all applications which
              currently utilize experimental modal parameters.  Thus, the many advantages of
              Ritz properties observed in the analytical and numerical aspects of structural
              engineering will be enabled in structural applications which to date currently
              utilize experimental modal properties.  This includes, but is not limited to,
              applications ranging from transient response prediction, model reduction,
              optimal design, experimental determination of analytical models for
              high-performance control design, force reconstruction, test-analysis
              correlation, model validation and verification, and structural health
              monitoring.
