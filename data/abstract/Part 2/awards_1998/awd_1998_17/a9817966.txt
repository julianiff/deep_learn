The goal of this project is to provide proof of the validity of
              the Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit (AET) language phylum. This proof will be
              documented by producing and disseminating an introductory description of the
              fundaments of comparative AET phonology and morphology, together with a
              comparative lexicon of AET at the highest level, that is, a given lexical item
              from one of the three branches will be included only if comparable with, or
              relevant to comparison with, at least one other branch. 

The results of the
              project will be diseminated in two forms: in the form of a CD containing the
              database and supporting documentation, and in hard copy form. The latter will
              include indices of AET forms and English keywords from the glosses.
