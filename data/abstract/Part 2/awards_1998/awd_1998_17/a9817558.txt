Abstract    :
              Jiri Jonas is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to continue his experimental research in the dynamic structure of
              liquids.  NMR and laser Raman scattering techniques will be used to study
              molecular motions, intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in liquids.  
              The research will focus on five areas: 1) NMR and Raman studies of the dynamics
              of liquids confined to nanoporous silica glasses; 2) High pressure NMR
              relaxation and chemical shift experiments on hydrogen bonded liquids and their
              binary mixtures; 3) The high pressure, variable temperature study of
              intramolecular Raman non-coincidence effect in model phthalate liquids to
              examine the effects of pressure and temperature on conformation; 4) High
              pressure 2D NOSEY NMR studies of alkyl benzoates; and 5) Systematic NMR
              relaxation studies of the dynamic structure of complex viscous liquids over
              pressures ranging from 1 bar to 9 kbar.

The studies of liquids in confined
              geometries has technological applications in many fields including catalysis,
              chromatography, membrane separations, and liquid permeability in geological
              formations which is important for tertiary oil recovery.
