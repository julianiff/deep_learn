Abstract

This award, provided by the
              Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program and the Antarctic Biology and Medicine
              Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports mapping, surveying, satellite
              imagery, and geodetic activities in support of the US Antarctic Research
              Program. Geodetic surveying, aerial photography, remote sensing (principally
              using several varieties of satellite imagery), and mapping comprise a variety
              of activities necessary for the successful operation of a multifaceted
              scientific and exploration effort in Antarctica. Year-round data acquisition,
              cataloging, and data dissemination activities will continue in the US Antarctic
              Resource Center for geospatial information. Field surveys will be conducted
              both in support of specific research projects and as part of a continuing
              program to collect ground control data required to transform existing geodetic
              data to an earth-centered system suitable for future satellite mapping
              programs. LandSat data will be collected as part of satellite image mapping
              activities and publication of additional 1:50,000 scale topographic maps in the
              Dry Valleys region will continue. The topographic maps provide a base map on
              which to portray scientific information, such as geological, glaciological, and
              biological information in a spatially accurate manner for analysis. The maps
              and satellite image maps will also be used by scientists to plan and execute
              future research work. Spatially references digital cartographic data will be
              produced in tandem with the published maps.
