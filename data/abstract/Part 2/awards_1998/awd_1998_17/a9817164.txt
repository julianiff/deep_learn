Abstract    :
              The PIs will study how the essential plant nutrient nitrogen (N) is transferred
              from soil microorganisms to plants during snow melt in the Colorado alpine. 
              The PIs preliminary studies show that there is a decline in the population of
              soil microorganisms during snow melt and that this decline coincides with an
              increase in N in the soil.  Surprisingly this pulse of N is almost entirely
              retained within the system and does not pollute downstream water sources.  The
              PIs will study the mechanics of how plants and fungi associated with plant
              roots compete with soil microorganisms for the N released during snow melt. 
              The PIs will also investigate what causes the decline of soil microorganisms
              during snow melt.  These studies will help us to understand how N is retained
              in alpine systems.  This information is important since N inputs (from car
              exhaust and power plant emissions) are increasing and N acts as a pollutant if
              it is flushed from alpine areas into downstream drinking water supplies.
