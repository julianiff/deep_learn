The primary goal for our LEXEN program is to test
              the hypothesis that there is a substantial microbial biosphere within oceanic
              crust.  A critical component of this study is to learn how this biosphere
              varies under different crustal-geothermal regimes, and how the organic carbon
              evidence of the sub-surface microbial activity is manifested at sites of widely
              different crustal age and sediment cover.   We will be determining the
              processes that control the distribution of life within the crust, specifically
              within (a) young crust with high temperature fluids vs old crust with warm
              fluids, (b) sedimented vs un-sedimented crustal sections, oxygenated crustal
              fluids vs anoxic fluids, and (d) long fluid residence times vs short residence
              times.  A plausible answer to the question regarding the existence of a
              sub-surface biosphere requires that we characterize the source fluids in terms
              of their organic composition and microbial taxonomy (lipids and molecular
              genetic probes), identify the fluid transit paths, the depth of fluid
              circulation and residence times in order to determine the area/volume of the
              crustal rocks that we are sampling.  Finally, it is important that we make a
              first-order estimate of how globally we can extrapolate our results, by
              comparison of data from both old and young sites at the same spreading
              center.
