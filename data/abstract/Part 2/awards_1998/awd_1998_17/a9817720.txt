This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Understanding and Conquering Long Time Scales in
              Computer Simulations, to be held in Hawaii from August 9-12, l999.  The
              co-organizers are Professors David Landau at the University of Georgia and
              Yutaka Okabe at the Tokyo Metropolitan University in Japan. 
Computer
              simulations in statistical physics have resulted in impressive gains in
              knowledge in diverse areas of physics.  With the advent of parallel computing
              platforms, it has become possible to simulate quite large systems and we can
              now seriously consider ways to span many orders of magnitude in length scale by
              using complementary algorithms.  There are many problems in physics, however,
              where it is not the size of the system that hinders progress but rather the
              restricted timescales that can be examined.

The goal of this seminar is to
              focus on understanding the problems with long time scales, which occur in
              diverse systems, and to examine ways of overcoming these difficulties.  The
              focus of the seminar involves the following topics:  1) critical slowing down -
              relaxation and dynamics;  2) cluster algorithms for classical models;  3) spin
              glasses and frustration;  4) glasses and glass formation;  5) polymers and
              proteins;  6)  quantum simulation methods;  and  7) nanoscale systems and
              magnetization reversal.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to
              involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange
              of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  It is anticipated that the proceedings will be
              published in the "Journal of Modern Physics C."  In addition, the individual
              papers will be available at the Center for Simulation Physics at the University
              of Georgia.
