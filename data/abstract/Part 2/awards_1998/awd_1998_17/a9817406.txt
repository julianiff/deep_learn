Abstract    :
              

Two key National Science Foundation reports, Systemic Engineering Education
              Reform: An Action Agenda and Shaping the Future: New Expectations for
              Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology,
              urge the formation of a national resource to provide access to quality
              courseware and to disseminate successful educational practices.  Since the
              early 1990s, NEEDS  the National Engineering Education Delivery System  has
              provided these services for the engineering education community.  Building on
              this base, this project will.  Develop a test-bed digital library for science,
              mathematics, engineering, and technology education (SMETE).  The library will
              provide courseware, cataloging, indexing, searching, and downloading to the
              science and mathematics communities. Initiate the development of a SMETE
              digital library community. Evaluate the test-bed library. Develop
              recommendations for the continued development of a SMETE digital library based
              on a needs assessment and test-bed evaluation.
