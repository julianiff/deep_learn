Biogenic Amines and Division of Labor in Honey Bee Colonies
              
Proposal #: IBN 98 178 93
PI Name:	Gene E. Robinson

The goal of this
              project is to determine whether the biogenic amines octopamine and serotonin
              influence the rate at which honeybees mature from working in the hive to taking
              on the more complex duties of foraging for nectar and pollen. If biogenic
              amines do function in this way, studies will be undertaken to determine whether
              they interact with endocrine signals to effect this regulation. The research
              will involve measurements of biogenic amines in the brains of individual bees,
              treatments of biogenic amines and hormones, and detailed behavioral
              analyses.
	Biogenic amines are known to exert short-term modulatory effects on
              a variety of behaviors in animals and humans but it is not known whether they
              also regulate long-term, developmental transitions from one behavioral phase to
              another.
