Abstract    :
              This research focuses on organometallic chemistry involving boron.  Previous
              efforts have established patterns of reactivity of a number of boronic species
              with various transition metal complexes.  Mechanistic studies have probed the
              mechanism of B-H elimination in group 5 metallocene systems.  A catalytic
              1,2-diborylation reaction of olefins has been developed which is attractive for
              olefin functionalization.  The proposed work will develop these and similar
              themes in three areas:  catalytic hydroboration using early transition metals,
              further development of olefin boration reactions, and reactions of
              1,2-diboration products.  These studies may lead to applications in polymer
              chemistry in areas such as polymer initiation and functionalization.

With
              this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support
              for the research of Dr. Milton R. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at
              Michigan State University.  Professor Smith is especially interested in the
              chemical  interactions of organic molecules containing transition metals with
              molecules containing a boron atom.  These studies are fundamental in nature,
              but may find applications in the area of polymer chemistry.
