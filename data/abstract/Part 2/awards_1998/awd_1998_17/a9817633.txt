An advanced boundary element integral method
              is proposed to investigated rheology of deformable liquid drops and elastic
              capsules in homogeneous and bounded flows at very low Reynolds numbers (Stokes
              flows).  Development and implementation of numerical methods for accurate
              tracking of two- and three-dimensional interfaces are proposed.  Several case
              studies are considered including suspension flow of liquid drops in channels,
              of liquid drops in homogeneous shear flow in the presence of surfactants, and
              of elastic capsules in homogeneous shear flow and channels.  If successful, the
              results will contribute to the advancement of basic understanding and
              prediction of suspension flows with deformable dispersed phases, with potential
              relevance to industrial, natural and physiological processes.
