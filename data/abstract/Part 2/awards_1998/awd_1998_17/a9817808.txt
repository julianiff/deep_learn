The 5th International Workshop on Variable Structure Systems
              (VSS'98)will be held from December 11 to 13 this year in Longboat Key, Florida.
              VSSt98 is the fifth in a series of biennial workshops bringing together
              researchers in the VSS area to discuss and share their latest developments in
              the theory and application of variable structure systems. The previous
              workshops were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia; Sheffield, UK; Bennevento, Italy
              and Tokyo, Japan. This is the first time that this workshop is organized and
              hosted by US control researchers. The workshop is scheduled during the week
              preceding the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control which will be held in
              Tampa, Florida.  High quality research are being pursued in many R&D centers in
              many countries around the world, as witnessed by the volume of published papers
              in the most prestigious journals in automatic control, several special issues
              have been also published. Many submitted and invited sessions, and plenary
              presentations on VSS have been included into the programs of key automatic
              control conferences, such that the American Control Conference, the Conference
              on Decision and Control (CDC), and the IFAC Congress. Control engineering
              design and practice which are based on VSS and Sliding Mode have improved
              system performance in many critical applications, such as robotics, electric
              drives, automotive control, and machine tools. VSS is recognized as one of the
              important research directions in modem control theory.  In our opinion, one of
              the key objectives of the VSS workshop series is to provide a forum for
              theoreticians and practicing engineers in automatic control to exchange ideas
              and share their perspectives, and for the young research investigators,
              particularly in US institutions, to have the opportunities to engage with the
              international VSS community. This workshop is focused on the application
              aspects in automotive control and aerospace systems which we considered to be
              of particular interests and great potentials.
