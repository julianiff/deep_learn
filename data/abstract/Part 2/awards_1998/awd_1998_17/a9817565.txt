Abstract    :
              The design of this project builds on the strengths of the Center for Biofilm
              Engineering (CBE - Montana State University) and the Center for Marine
              Biofouling and Bio-Inovation (BMBB - University of New South Wales, Sydney,
              Australia).  As the CBE began to discover the structural complexity and
              architectural sophistication of biofilms, it became obvious that some form of
              cell-cell signaling must be operative in these biofilms.  The CBE is to build a
              Biofilm Behavior Screenging Unit (BBSU) that will use confocal scanning
              microscopy (CSLM) and state-of-the-art image analysis to detect the effects of
              putative biofilm control molecules on biofilm formation and detachment.  The
              CMBB discovered that some marine plants are protected from biofilm formation on
              their surfaces by a class of chemical compounds (furanones) that resemble the
              cell-cell signals (acyl-homoerine lactones - AHLs) used by bacteria for "quorum
              sensing".  Both Centers will continue to determine the effects of natural AHLs
              and AHL antagonists on biofilm formation and detachmment and will cooperate in
              the selection of chemically stable, economical, nontoxic AHLs and AHL-like
              molecules that will serve industry as environmentally benign biofilm control
              agents.
