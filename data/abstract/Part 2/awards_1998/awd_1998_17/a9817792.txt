This research will apply new technological advances to the
              study of an outstanding biological question - how do sperm-egg interactions
              during and following fertilization affect reproductive success? The primary
              role of sperm has traditionally been viewed as a delivery vehicle for the "DNA
              cargo." However, recent evidence indicates that sperm may play a more
              fundamental role in fertilization and early development. For example, in almost
              all cases examined, including humans and other mammals, the entire sperm cell
              enters the egg at fertilization. Sperm structure within the egg may therefore
              be an essential element of fertilization, as supported by the existence of
              Drosophila mutants defective in both sperm structure within the egg and
              subsequent embryonic development. This incompatibility between sperm inside the
              egg may represent an unrecognized mechanism of sterility between
              individuals.

Sperm-egg incompatibility will be studied in three steps using
              Drosophila: (1) the 3D structure of sperm inside eggs from matings of the same
              species will be determined and compared with, (2) the 3D sperm structures
              inside eggs from matings between different species. Information gathered in (1)
              and (2) will be used for a detailed analysis of the fitness consequences of
              altered sperm-egg interactions. (3) 3D sperm structure will be determined using
              the CAVE, a virtual reality environment, in which 3D projections of sperm
              inside eggs will be traced and compared. The use of the CAVE represents a novel
              application of super computing technology to complex biological processes. The
              ubiquitous nature of sperm-egg interactions during and following fertilization
              suggest that these findings will have relevance to the reproductive biology to
              a wide range of animals, including endangered species and humans.
