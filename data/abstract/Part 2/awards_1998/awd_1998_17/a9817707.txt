Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Lucy M. Ziurys of the University of Arizona will use
              high-resolutional millimeter- and submillimeter-wave rotational spectroscopy to
              study small organometallic monomeric species in the gas phase.  Among the
              molecules to be investigated are short-lived transition metal alkyl compounds,
              alkali carbenes, methylidynes, carbides, and metal amides that have not been
              studied by any spectroscopic method.  Obtaining the pure rotational spectra of
              these metal-bearing molecules will enable numerous properties of these
              compounds to be determined, such as the electronic ground-state configuration
              and information about the metal-ligand bonding, the degree of ionic versus
              covalent bonding, and the presence of inversion barriers.  The data will
              provide a data base for testing theories of the coupling of angular
              momenta.

The data obtained in this study will provide information on the
              bonding of metals to various different kinds of organic molecular groups. 
              These results can therefore provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms
              involved in catalytic reactions on metal-containing surfaces and thus has an
              impact on manufacturing of chemicals and chemical vapor deposition.
