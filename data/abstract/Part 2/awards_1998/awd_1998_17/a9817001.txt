Abstract    :
              Maintenance of potassium balance in the whole animal is essential to sustain
              life.  A small change in the body's potassium concentration can have dramatic
              adverse effects.  Both low and high potassium concentrations can result in
              potentially fatal muscle paralysis and heart malfunction.  The kidney is the
              principal organ in mammals that regulates whole body potassium balance.  When
              potassium intake in the diet is normal, the rate of potassium excreted in the
              urine is small compared to the amount of potassium filtered, indicating a large
              absorptive capacity of the kidney for potassium.  This absorptive capacity is
              believed to be mediated by proteins in the kidney that pump potassium from the
              urine back into the body fluid.  These proteins belong to the
              hydrogen-potassium ATPase (H, K-ATPase) family of enzymes.  Despite the growing
              body of work regarding the molecular and cellular aspects of these enzymes, the
              kidney H,K-ATPases remain incompletely described.

The objective of this
              research is to carry out a detailed molecular genetic analysis of a specific
              H,K-ATPase in the kidney implicated as the enzyme responsible for potassium
              conservation under conditions of potassium deprivation.  This work will allow
              for a better understanding of how the kidney regulates whole body potassium
              balance. Information obtained from thee studies can potentially be applied to
              any gene that responds to changes in the body's potassium concentration. 
              Undergraduate students will be introduced to basic biological research by
              working on all aspects of this project.
