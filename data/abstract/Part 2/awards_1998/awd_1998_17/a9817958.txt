              ABSTRACT

Corrosion in production systems is a major
              problem for all oil and gas producing companies.  This is especially true for
              future production in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Intervention and
              remediation is extremely expensive in these environments and the
              state-of-the-art for predicting corrosion in multiphase systems is almost
              non-existent. In its first five years the Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Corrosion in Multiphase Systems at Ohio University has the
              center has made substantial progress towards understanding the effect of
              multiphase flow on corrosion.  The knowledge has been developed based on a
              database of more than 50,000 points generated on oil/water/gas holdup and
              velocity profiles at various inclinations, input ratios and flow rates at
              different pressures and temperatures in pipes of different diameters. 
              Particularly, the Center has been instrumental in enlightening the corrosion
              community about the effect of the impact and collapse of entrained gas bubbles
              on the pipe wall. While uniform or general corrosion is now reasonably
              understood, localized corrosion still needs to be investigated further. The
              research foci of this renewal proposal include the following new project
              areas:1) Corrosion Inhibition Studies; 2) Corrosion in Sour Systems; 3)
              Corrosion in Wet Gas Systems; 4) Hilly Terrain; and 5) Slug and Corrosion
              Tracking.
