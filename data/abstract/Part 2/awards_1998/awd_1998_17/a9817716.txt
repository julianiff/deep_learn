Abstract    :
              The University System of Maryland with cooperation from the two and four-year
              institutions in the state will host a regional workshop for mathematics,
              science, and science education faculty and administrators from campuses in
              Maryland and surrounding states.  The workshop will address four major
              issues:
Scientific literacy for undergraduate science majors, improving the
              science education for pre-service teachers, improving the science education of
              science and technology majors to provide improved familiarity with technology,
              flexibility, and a path to lifelong learning and building the K-16
              culture.

Teams of SMET faculty from each of the Maryland public and private
              two-year and four-year institutions will be invited to a one-day participatory
              workshop to continue a dialogue which began at the Spring 1998 Maryland Higher
              Education K-16 Conference.  In addition, regional representatives from
              neighboring states:  Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, and Pennsylvania will
              be invited to share successful models of improved undergraduate science
              education, collaboration with K-12 schools, and innovative pedagogy which
              incorporates technology and experiential learning.

The one-day workshop will
              be guided by a steering committee representing the major two and four year
              institutions in Maryland, along with representatives of K-12 and industry.
