Abstract    :
              In today's data management environment, query processing is spread across
              multiple components, with each middleware component doing some of these tasks,
              and with some tasks done several times, which we term staged query processing.
              The potential presence of multiple stages restricts the information available
              to the middleware component, with particular impact on query optimization. The
              conventional approach, of cost-based query optimization, in which numerous
              query plans are enumerated and the cheapest one selected, is not appropriate
              when detailed cost metrics are not available and when the later stages perform
              their own, complex optimization. A new approach, termed cost-based graph
              rewriting, is used to transform a query in one query language into an efficient
              output query in perhaps a different language. A novel idiomatic cost estimator
              provides cost parameters to the rewriter, enabling the rewriter to determine
              the processing that should take place within the component, and the processing
              that should be performed by later stages. This estimator is more coarse-grained
              than conventional estimators; in particular, it does not cost individual
              relational operators in a query plan. The goal of this exploratory research
              project is to develop an initial prototype utilizing these concepts for a
              temporal middleware component translating TSQL2 into SQL, and to evaluate the
              efficacy of this approach by targeting at least two different commercial DBMSs
              and demonstrating that the middleware component can reflect the differences of
              these DBMSs in the generated code.
