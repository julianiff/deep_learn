Proposal #: IBN-9817889
PI Name: David Perkel

Humans,
              cetaceans (whales and dolphins) and some birds are the only animals known to
              learn their vocalizations.  Songbirds thus provide a uniquely accessible model
              system for studying how the brain learns vocal behaviors. The brain structures
              involved in avian song production and learning are distinct and well defined,
              but their functional connections are not well understood. The present proposal
              will examine an avian brain circuit, the anterior forebrain pathway, which (1)
              is necessary for vocal learning but not song production and (2) resembles a
              circuit known in 
mammals to be involved in a variety of motor and cognitive
              functions.

These experiments will use immunological and electrophysiological
              techniques to determine whether the AFP, as in its mammalian counterpart, has
              two sequential stages of inhibitory projections, i.e. whether the same
              functional wiring occurs in the songbird. Two primary benefits are:  (1)
              clarification of how the circuit works in songbirds to mediate vocal learning
              and (2) testing for evolutionarily conserved circuitry, which would suggest
              more general rules for motor 
learning. Such similarities would provide
              essential guidance for further experiments aimed at understanding the detailed
              cellular mechanisms of vocal learning and of motor learning in general.
