Abstract    :
              This award supports a conference on 
``Approximation and Complexity in
              Numerical Optimization:
Continuous and Discrete Problems'' to be held at
              the
Center for Applied Optimization, University of Florida,
February 28 -
              March 2, 1999. The conference will be concerned 
with new algorithmic
              approaches, applications and software for
computationally difficult discrete
              and continuous optimization problems.

The major objective of the meeting is
              to provide a unique opportunity
for researchers working on theory,
              approximation algorithms, and
applications of discrete and non-convex
              programming, to discuss recent
research advances, to establish a foundation
              for joint research cooperation,
and to stimulate future interdisciplinary
              research.
