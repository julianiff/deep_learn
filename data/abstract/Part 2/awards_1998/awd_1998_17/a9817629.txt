The Coeur d'Alene language is a highly endangered, 
              under-documented, native American language that is today beginning to  undergo
              a major revival effort.  It is spoken fluently today by only  a few elders of
              the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in northern Idaho.  Due  to the advanced age and
              small number of speakers, there is an urgent  need to preserve what remains of
              this  important part of our common  American heritage. 

The object of this
              project is to proceed toward the preservation  of the Coeur d'Alene language on
              two fronts:  one technical, the  other educational.  Thus, the goal of the
              Coeur d'Alene Dictionaries  Project is to create two dictionaries of the
              language:  a  comprehensive, linguistically sophisticated, analytical
              dictionary  and a corresponding instructional dictionary.  The analytical 
              dictionary is intended for use by linguists, anthropologists,  historians, and
              other scholars and will include all information  necessary for scholarly
              investigation of the language. The  instructional dictionary will be designed
              for use by non-specialists,  including high school and college students of the
              language, and  interested members of the native and non-native communities. 
              The  dictionaries and the computer database will be available to the Coeur 
              d'Alene language program for use in developing computer-assisted  language
              teaching materials.
