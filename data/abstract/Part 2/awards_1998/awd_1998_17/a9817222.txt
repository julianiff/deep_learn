Abstract    :
              The 2nd IEEE Signal Processing Society Multimedia Signal  Processing Workshop
              will take place in Redondo Beach, CA, in  December 1998. The first workshop was
              held in Princeton, NJ,  in June 1997. The objective of the workshop is to bring
               together experts in areas, which are increasingly being  required to interact
              with each other, as emerging integrated  media systems become available. As an
              example, the list of  topics includes areas such as databases, communications, 
              processing and interfaces. The objective of the workshop is  to study how
              issues arising in the above fields affect  signal processing for multimedia
              systems.  The goal of the funds requested in this proposal is to  facilitate
              the participation of students. The student  support will come in the form of
              reduced registration fees  and/or travel support. Reduced registration will
              made  available to as many students as possible.
