Title: Search Modes and Repertoires in Traditional
              Pavlovian Paradigms

The goal of this research is to develop a systems
              approach to motivated behavior that combines an ethological emphasis on
              naturally occurring behavior with a psychologist's precise analysis of how
              learning changes the form and probability of responses.  The behavior systems
              approach attempts to resolve the split between ethologists and psychologists by
              assuming that the same substrate of sequential search states and  
              perceptual-motor organization underlies the behavior of animals whether they
              are free-ranging or constrained.  This research specifically tests how a
              sequence of search modes is revealed by and contributes to traditional
              laboratory phenomena in Pavlovian Conditioning, including the control of
              excitatory states by temporal duration and simple conditioned-stimuli,
              intertrial clocks, serial conditioned stimuli, higher-order conditioning, and 
              backward conditioning.
	The results of this research should provide a specific
              but generalizable framework for integrating the field observations of natural
              scientists with the extensive laboratory research on learning in animals.  By
              embedding foraging behavior in the sensory, motor, and motivational
              organization of a behavior system, the present approach provides a specific
              model that can predict behavior in the laboratory as well as in field and
              applied settings.  A behavior systems framework should provide a basis for
              generating similar models for other species, and for defining more clearly the
              effects of neurophysiological and drug-related manipulations.
