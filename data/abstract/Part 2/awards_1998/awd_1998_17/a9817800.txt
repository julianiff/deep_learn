The
              award is to support travel to the International Heat Transfer Conference in
              Kyongju, Korea.  The PI will present a paper on his current research and meet
              with representatives of Korean firms involved in crystal growth.  The
              industrial meeting will concentrate on developing a radiative transfer model as
              part of the PI's involvement in a Consortium for Crystal Growth located at the
              State University of New York.
