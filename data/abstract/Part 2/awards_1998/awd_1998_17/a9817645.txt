This grant provides partial support for the costs of acquiring
              a High-Pressure Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) for the Amino Acid Laboratory at
              the Center for Geochronologic Research, Institute of Arctic and Alpine
              Research, University of Colorado.  The PI's have a long history of field and
              analytical programs that incorporate racemization as a tool to address issues
              in Quaternary paleoclimatology.  The new HPLC will take advantage of recent
              engineering and methodological advances in reverse phase HPLC, and will allow
              routine separation of most amino acid stereoisomers from geological materials
              with nearly two orders of magnitude less sample than previously required.  In
              particular, reverse phase HPLC offers the advantage of measuring D/L ratios for
              fast-racemizing aspartic acid, providing greater age and paleotemperature
              resolution for environmental change at high latitudes.  Improved data
              processing and data handling will allow more efficient utilization of
              measurements.  Ongoing NSF-sponsored in-house and collaborative research
              programs are targeted toward quantifying climate change in the Canadian Arctic,
              Russian Arctic, Norwegian Arctic, as well as in Australia and Antarctica. 
              Support for this grant is shared between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and
              Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences'
              Paleoclimate Program (ATM/PC).
