Description: This award is to support an US-Jordan Workshop
              on Developing a Modern Power Electronics Curriculum, to be held in Amman,
              Jordan, May 1-5, 1999.  The Principal Investigator is Dr. Issa Batarseh,
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Central Florida,
              in Orlando, Florida.  The Jordanian organizer is Dr. Sadeq Hamed of the
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Jordan in
              Amman, Jordan.  The topics will cover: power electronics curriculum
              development; hardware and software laboratory development; power system,
              machines and power electronics interface; research needs; and
              industry-university collaboration.  The objectives of the five-day workshop
              are: (1) review and discuss the current course offerings and industry needs for
              power electronics engineers; (2) reach consensus on global power electronics
              curricula; (3) make recommendations on laboratory course outline and on
              hardware laboratory and computer simulation support and equipment; and (4)
              recommend areas for collaborative research. 

Scope:  This project will allow
              eight US scientists, who are experienced in power electronics, to examine with
              participating scientists from Jordan the needs of training and research in
              power electronics, and to develop an agenda for joint research in this area. 
              It is expected that this effort will result in recommendations of a globally
              usable curriculum for training of power electronics engineers to deal with the
              various applications and demands of current and nascent industries.  This
              proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international workshops that are
              likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest.  This project is
              co-funded by INT and the Division of Electrical and communications Systems.
