DLI Phase 2: High-Performance Digital Library Classification Systems:
              From Information Retrieval to Knowledge Management

This is the first year
              funding of a three year continuing award.  The proposed research aims to
              develop an architecture and the associated techniques needed to automatically
              generate classification systems from large domain-specific textual collections
              and to unify them with manually created classification systems to assist in
              effective digital library retrieval and analysis. Both algorithmic developments
              and user evaluation in several sample domains will be conducted in this
              project.  Scalable automatic clustering methods including Ward's clustering,
              multi-dimensional scaling, latent semantic indexing, and self-organizing map
              will be developed and compared. Most of these algorithms, which are
              computationally intensive, will be optimized based on the sparsity of common
              keywords in textual document representations. Using parallel,
high-performance
              platforms as a time machine for simulation, we plan to parallellize and
              benchmark the above clustering algorithms for large-scale collections (on the
              order of millions of documents) in several domains. Results of these automatic
              classification systems will be represented using several novel hierarchical
              display methods.

The testbed of research will include three application
              domains that consist of both large-scale collections and existing
              classification systems:  (1) medicine: CancerLit (700,000  cancer abstracts)
              and the NLM's UMLS (500,000 medical concepts), (2) geoscience: GeoRef and
              Petroleum Abstracts (800,000 abstracts)  and Georef thesaurus (26,000
              geoscience terms), and  (3) Web application: a WWW collection (1.5M web pages)
              and the Yahoo! classification (20,000 categories). Medical subjects, geo
              scientists, and WWW search engine users will be used in the evaluation plan.
