Abstract    :
              Hofmann 98-17200                                                                
                                                                                 Organisms
              protect themselves from numerous environmental stresses using the heat shock
              response, which includes a increase in the abundance of heat shock proteins
              (HSPs).  Some of these HSPs serve as molecular chaparones to allow proteins to
              retain the 3-dimensional structure necessary for protein function.  Much work
              has been done on the cell and molecular biology of HSPs.  This symposium will
              asses the role of HSPs in nature and the evolution of HSPs and the heat shock
              response.   Some speakers will address the role of HSPs in organismal tolerance
              to heat, hibernation, response to parasitism and in normal development and
              aging processes.  Other participants will emphasize the expression of HSPs in
              organisms in nature, the cost and benefits of HSP expression and the evolution
              of HSP genes.  The symposium will facilitate discussion, interaction and
              collaboration among scientist in diverse disciplines who are studying this
              important biological issue.   The symposium will review the current state of
              knowledge about HSPs in organismal biology and highlight unanswered questions. 
              By doing so, it will determine future research directions.
