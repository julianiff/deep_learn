	This award provides funds to partially support the fourth New
              
Researchers Conference sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical
              
Statistics.  The purpose of this conference is the development of 
junior
              researchers in statistics and probability, with special 
emphasis on mentoring
              women and underrepresented minorities.  The 
meeting is planned for August
              4-7, 1999 at the Johns Hopkins 
University Homewood Campus in Baltimore, just
              prior to the annual 
joint statistical meetings to be held in Baltimore. 
              Support is 
offered to 50 junior researchers, within 5 years of degree, who
              
will present their work and interact with other colleagues.  
Three senior
              researchers and a panel of representatives of funding 
agencies including NSF,
              NSA and NIH.
