Abstract    :
              This project examines in a general context the determinants of the choice made
              by sellers between an auction and a negotiation method of sale. The limited
              existing theoretical literature on this topic largely ignores variety of
              relevant transaction costs in determining sellers' choices. Analysis of the
              role played by transaction costs in the choice between auction and negotiated
              sales is the focus of this project. Among the transaction costs considered are
              presale measurement costs, the costs of the auction process itself, the costs
              of an auction associated with the constraints an auction imposes on the buyers'
              offers, contract enforcement costs, and possible principal-agent costs
              associated with the seller's decision to hire a consultant/auctioneer.  This
              project also examines empirically the determinants of individual sellers'
              choices between auctions and negotiated sales in two contexts-private timber
              and cattle sales. The particular empirical applications are chosen because both
              auctions and negotiations are commonly used in the industries. A data set has
              been collected for examining private timber sales. The data set contains
              detailed information on 360 timber sales from North Carolina and is comprised
              of approximately 50 percent auction and 50 percent negotiated sales.
              Preliminary analysis provides convincing evidence that the specified
              transaction costs are important determinants of the choice by private timber
              owners between auction and negotiated sales procedures.   The proposed study
              will greatly enhance our understanding of the choice among sales procedures,
              both conceptually and empirically.
