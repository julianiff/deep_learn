Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Kenneth Janda of the University of California, Irvine
              will study the spectroscopy and dynamics of molecules in ultra low temperature
              liquid helium droplets.  Infrared laser spectroscopy and infrared-optical
              double resonance will be used to study the formation of binary species in order
              to investigate how such sub-clusters form and how quickly they can dissipate
              energy.  Spectra will be sought for molecules that are encapsulated in or on
              the surface of a cluster containing argon atoms.

The long-term goal of this
              project is to use helium clusters to make new species by low temperature
              photochemistry.  This project will provide important information on how the
              superfluid environment of liquid helium cools the vibrational motions of a
              molecule and will help further the goal of synthesis in ultra-cold clusters. 
              This information ultimately will have an impact on the nature of bonding and
              chemical structures at ultra low temperatures and the factors limiting chemical
              reactions at temperatures near absolute zero.
