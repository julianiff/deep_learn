Abstract    :
              The Treasure Island, California, deep instrumentation array is currently one of
              the most heavily-instrumented and best-characterized installations in the
              United States for measuring the effects of strong motion earthquakes.  It is
              located in San Francisco Bay, between the San Andreas and the Hayward faults. 
              In 1990, the aggregate probability of an event of magnitude 7 or greater on or
              the other of these faults was estimated at 67% over the subsequent 30 years;
              newer information may cause this estimate to be revised upward.

The site was
              established in 1991-1992 by the National Science Foundation to directly measure
              the non-linear response of a deep soil profile to strong ground shaking.  The
              site consists of an 86 meter deep soft soil profile over bedrock.  Similar soil
              conditions exist under large parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and in other
              cities with a similar earthquake risk.  The Island is in the process of being
              transferred by the US Navy to the City of San Francisco, which strongly
              supports the continued existence of this array.  Instrumentation is maintained
              by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program, which is also
              committed to publishing the strong-motion data.

This action is to establish
              a committee to oversee the operation of this array and the use of this site for
              research in earthquake hazard mitigation.  The committee is to be composed of
              seismologists and geotechnical engineers from academia, government agencies,
              and private practice.  This committee will review critically the state of the
              site characterization and instrumentation, define experiments that could be
              performed at this site, and serve as the primary point of contact for
              investigators wishing to undertake experiments at this site.
