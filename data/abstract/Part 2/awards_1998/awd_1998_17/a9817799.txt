Abstract    :
              This Project is a component of the InterLib collaboration between University of
              California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and
              Stanford University.  The combined interLib technologies will
be demonstrated
              on the emerging California Digital Library (CDL), and on a testbed developed by
              the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The Stanford Project will attempt to
              develop base technologies to overcome critical barriers to effective digital
              libraries.  These include:  heterogeneity of information and services; lack of
              powerful filtering
mechanisms that let users find truly valuable information;
              insufficient availability of interfaces and tools that effectively operate on
              portable devices; and lack of a solid economic infrastructure that
              encourages
providers to make information available, and gives users privacy
              guarantees.
