This project will organize a study on advanced
              mathematics and science courses in U.S. high schools to take place over 30
              months.  This is a timely effort as the recently-released 12th-grade results
              from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) found that
              U.S. students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Programs outperformed only
              one of the other 16 participating TIMSS countries.  The study's organizing
              question will be, "Are secondary mathematics and science instruction and
              assessment programs doing all they can to help sutdents develop advanced
              competencies in these subjects?"  The AP Programs, International Baccalaureates
              (IB) Programs and perhaps others will be examined.

The study will be carried
              out under the auspices of the Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and
              Education of the National Research Council (CBASSE).  A study committee of
              approximately 18 members will be named and will include experts in the subjects
              of calculus, physics and biology, as well as math and science education,
              assessment, cognitive science and education policy.  The committee will meet
              approximately seven times over the first 24 project months.  Additional
              meetings are scheduled for the six-month dissemination period.  The committee
              will gather information through fact-finding workshops, literature reviews and
              commissioned papers from independent scholars.  As a result of the study, a
              consensus report will be developed with recommendations that will address major
              aspects of the AP, IB and other programs under study and tie results to issues
              of concern in the mathematics and science education communities.
