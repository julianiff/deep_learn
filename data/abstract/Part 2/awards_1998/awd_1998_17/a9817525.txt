This proposal is on nonlinear analysis with an emphasis
              on applied mathematics
problems in material science and financial mathematics.
               Particular applications
in material science include modeling grain
              boundaries, super cooled solidification,
and superconductivity.  In financial
              mathematics, applications include pricing
contingent claims in incomplete
              markets and consumption-investment problems.
As an analytical tool, the PI
              proposes to develop a theory of bounded variation
to suitable for
              vector-valued functions.  This theory of functions of type BnV
may have a wide
              impact in real analysis.  In financial mathematics, the PI will
look at
              problems with portfolio constraints, transaction costs, and models
              with
stocastic volatility.

The sophisticated mathematical models arising in
              the study of new materials and 
in financial transactions require new methods
              of mathematics to show that the 
models are consistent with reality and give
              reasonable results.  The PI will be
investigating new methods of analysis to
              apply to such problems as superconducting
materials and financial models of
              derivative transactions
