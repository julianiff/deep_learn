Abstract    :
              HRD-9817676

This Minority Graduate Education proposal is a collaborative
              project between the University of Florida and Florida A&M University to develop
              a comprehensive professional development program to identify and nurture "at
              promise" minority students who have the ability and interest to pursue an
              academic career in science and engineering.  It incorporates current
              understanding of the obstacles faced by students who chose to enter his career
              track.

The objectives if the program are:
1. Increase the pool of minority
              undergraduate students who are prepared and choose to pursue a doctoral career
              in science and engineering (S&E)
2. Increase the number of minority doctoral
              students who are prepared and choose to pursue an academic career as faculty
              members
3. Provide financial support for minority students who choose this
              career path
4. Provide affective support to facilitate the successful
              completion of doctoral degrees by these students
5. Diversify the S&E graduate
              population at UF
6. Increase the number of minority S&E faculty
              members

Strategies to accomplish this include recruitment, mentoring,
              academic preparedness and professional development components.  These
              strategies will be model for other institutions across the country truly
              committed to increasing the pool of talented minority faculty in science and
              engineering.
