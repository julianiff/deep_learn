Abstract    :
              
Limits to exercise performance are little understood in animals. Hummingbirds
              exemplify metabolic specialization for enhanced energetic capacity during
              flight, and thus represent a prime example of extreme physiological design in
              respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems. The analysis of hummingbird
              flight may thus reveal fundamental limits to the biomechanics and physiology of
              vertebrate locomotor performance, including that of humans.  This study will
              examine limits to flight performance in diverse hummingbird species, and will
              determine potentially variable contributions of body size, wing morphology,
              flight kinematics, aerodynamics, and respiratory energetics to flight capacity.
               Interspecific comparisons of hummingbirds will include studies of hovering
              flight performance across altitudinal gradients which, because of physical
              variation in air density and oxygen availability, present particular
              aerodynamic and physiological challenges to flying animals.  Analysis of
              hovering flight will be augmented by study of limits to forward flight
              performance carried out on hummingbirds flying at different airspeeds in a wind
              tunnel.  The combined results for hovering and forward flight will yield basic
              conclusions as to the nature of aerodynamic and physiological constraints on
              hummingbird flight capacity, and more generally will delineate broad
              performance limits to vertebrate exercise physiology.
