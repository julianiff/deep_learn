ABSTRACT

A workshop titled "The Role of
              Grammatical Functions in Transformational Syntax" will be held during the 1999
              Linguistic Institute at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana.  The
              workshop will explore the place of grammatical functions (GFs) in
              transformational theories of syntax, which since Noam Chomsky's 1965 book
              Aspects of the Theory of Syntax have held that GFs such as subject and object
              are not primitives of the theory, but are defined in terms of the hierarchical
              configurations of phrase structure representations.  Recent instantiations of
              these theories, such as Principles and Parameters and the Minimalist Program,
              have undergone revisions which incorporate principles utilizing GFs in a way
              that appears to admit their roles as primitives.  These innovations raise the
              fundamental question of whether or not GFs can indeed be configurational, i.e.
              defined on phrase structure representations.

The workshop will bring
              together the work of leading researchers relating to these issues, including:
              
* - the ways in which GFs have been incorporated into current
              transformational theories; 
* - whether unitary configurationally defined GFs
              can be identified in current transformational syntax; 
* - if configurational
              definitions of GFs have been reduced to axioms of the theory, the degree to
              which these structural representations of GFs yield significant insights; 
* -
              the inventory of GFs that must be recognized in the theory; 
* - and whether
              all languages instantiate all projections involved in defining GFs.
