Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. David B. Rorabacher and Dr.
              Ronald R. Schroeder, Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, and of
              Dr. Leo A. Ochrymowycz, Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin at Eau
              Claire. The project involves an investigation of the redox behavior of
              copper(II)/(I) systems in which electron transfer and conformational changes
              occur sequentially rather than by a concerted fashion. The results will be
              relevant in efforts of being able to manipulate structure to control gated
              electron transfer events.

The results from this wide ranging proposal will
              be useful in addressing how gated electron transfer processes take place in
              biological systems. Results will also be of interest in the design of specific
              catalytic systems. Undergraduate and graduate students from both institutions
              will receive excellent training in photochemistry and in electron transfer
              chemistry.
