Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the theoretical work of Dr. Suzanne Harris,
              Department of Chemistry, University of Wyoming, whose principal goal is to
              explore the cooperative role of two metal centers in homogeneous and
              heterogeneous hydrodesulfurization. Also, calculations will be done on extended
              solids using high density functional methods and the Fenske-Hall approach whose
              combination represents a novel powerful tool.

The work will be of interest
              not only to hydrodesulfurization but also to catalysis in general. Success of
              these calculations should lead to improvements of the HDS process and thereby
              diminish environmental pollution. Undergraduate and graduate students and
              post-doctoral associates will receive excellent training in theoretical
              calculations that have practical interest.
