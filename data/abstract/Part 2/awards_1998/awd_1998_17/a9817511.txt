Abstract    :
              An increasing amount of information being transmitted over the Internet isin
              image form.  This trend includes medical images used in diagnosis and research,
              and other materials for which it is desirable to avoid violations of security
              and privacy.  While privacy and secuity control of textual materials has long
              been a focus of research activities, images present new and more challenging
              problems.  Filtering of images in addition to text becmes more essential as
              modern computing and communications facilitates the use of information in image
              form. This project proposes to provide image filtering capabilities to
              complement other means of checking the contents of documents.  The domain of
              interest is electronic medical records, but the research products are expected
              to be generalizable to other domains of interest.  The effort will forcus on
              developing further wavelet-based algorithms for searching medical image
              databases and retrieving relevant information from multimedia medical
              databases; extracting textual information from images; advancing practices for
              the protection of privacy and implementing a security mediator; and exploring
              WWW interfaces for security mediators.
