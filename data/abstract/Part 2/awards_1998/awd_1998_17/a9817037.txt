Abstract    :
              From an evolutionary point of view, no physiological functions are as adaptive
              as those which ensure successful reproduction.  In most animals, the
              constellation of behaviors that promote copulation and impregnation are vital
              to survival of a species.  The male sex hormone testosterone (T) is essential
              for the expression of male sexual motivation and performance.  Neural tissues
              metabolize T into estradiol (E2) by the cytochrome P450 aromatase (ARO). 
              Numerous observations suggest that both T and E2 synergize to regulate sexual
              performance.   Much remains to learned about the specific cellular pathways by
              which steroids act in the brain.  Our preliminary results demonstrate that E2
              exerts novel short-latency stimulatory effects on the motivational aspects of
              male sexual behavior.  These data suggest that T-derived E2 could mediate male
              sexual activity through "non-classical", possibly non-transcriptional
              mechanisms in the brain.  This novel hypothesis has never been tested before
              although there is substantial evidence that E2 is capable of exerting rapid
              effects on other aspects of the brain function.  Thus, we will use stereotaxic
              drug administration and standard tests of male sexual behavior to
              systematically test a new model of the cellular mechanism underlying estrogenic
              control of male sexual behavior and determine the effect of in situ
              aromatization on sexual motivation.  These studies are valuable because they
              will advance our understanding of the endocrine regulation of neural function
              in adult mammals.
