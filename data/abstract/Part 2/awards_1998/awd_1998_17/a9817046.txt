Abstract

This award, provided by the
              Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs,
              supports the third international workshop on the Antarctic Digital Magnetic
              Anomaly Project (ADMAP III)  to be held during May, 1999, at the Byrd Polar
              Research Center in Columbus, Ohio. This Project is an international effort to
              compile magnetic data in a comprehensive and well integrated fashion for the
              entire Antarctic continent. This effort is coordinated with an effort to
              compile magnetic data worldwide. The workshop will focus attention on the
              production of the magnetic compilation and its contributions to Antarctic
              geology. The workshop will immediately preceed the Spring, 1999, meeting of the
              American Geophysical Union in Boston (MA) where a special session on the
              scientific research activities of ADMAP will be presented. ADMAP III will
              finalize details for the production of the digital magnetic anomaly database
              and map, consider the progress of related efforts, assess the impact of planned
              field surveys for improving the database, and identify geological issues that
              in the context of the database warrant new field surveying efforts.
