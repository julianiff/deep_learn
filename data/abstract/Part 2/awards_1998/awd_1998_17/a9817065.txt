This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              involves opportunistic and high risk research into the linked processes that
              govern the distribution and abundance of microbial communities within actively
              growing sulfide deposits on seafloor hydrothermal vent fields. Building upon a
              collaborative seagoing expedition to recover several large active sulfide
              structures from the seafloor, and to conduct innovative research on the
              distribution, abundance and community dynamics of surficial macrofaunal
              communities and microbial activity within this evolving habitat, researchers
              will utilize the recovery event as a perturbation experiment to examine the
              plumbing of nearby outflow sites, and track the ultimate regrowth of the
              sulfide habitat-deposit. To obtain this information funds are provided for
              development and deployment of a spider-temperature array, an in-situ stump
              temperature package for monitoring regrowth of a sulfide structure over a one
              year period, and for a time lapse camera, which allows visual monitoring of
              sulfide growth and recolonization by biological communities.  The results of
              this research will bear significantly on the formation of metal deposits, on
              the roles of microorganisms in hydrothermal systems, and on the shifting
              physics and chemistry of perturbed submarine hydrothermal systems.
