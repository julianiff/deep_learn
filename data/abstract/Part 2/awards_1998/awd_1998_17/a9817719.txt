We hypothesize that the bioavailability of adsorbed organic
              contaminants is determined by their conformation upon adsorption and that this
              conformation is affected by the chemical properties of the surface and the
              contaminant. Research will quantify the surface chemistry effects on adsorption
              conformation and the subsequent availability of adsorbed contaminants for
              bacterial degradation.

We will determine the degradation kinetics for model
              compounds separately and as mixtures in suspended pure and mixed bacterial
              cultures. Biofilm formation kinetics for pure and defiined mixed cultures,
              cultivated on a benign substrate will be determined. Silicon crystals of known
              texture will serve as control surfaces.

Next we will use self assembled
              monolayers (SAMs) to bind desired functional groups to silicon sub strata; thus
              controlling local surface chemistry at constant topography. Variation in
              surface chemistry of each substratum will be determined by a regimen of surface
              analyses.

Single organic contaminants, then mixtures of those contaminants
              will be exposed to the various sub strata. Contaminant configuration will vary
              due to the pre-treatment chemistry or the spatial variation in that treatment.
              Contaminant conformations will be quantified using the techniques
              above.

Rates of bacterial cell adhesion and bio~im formation will be
              measured non-invasively using ~uorescent confocal microscopic image analysis.
              Degradation of adsorbed contarninants will be monitored using ~uorescent
              reporter genes. Rates of contaminant degradation, alone or within a mixture,
              will be correlated to the molecular configuration adsorbed to the surface.
