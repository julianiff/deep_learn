Abstract    :
              Contrary to dogma, the adult brain exhibits considerable plasticity. New
cells
              which are born in particular regions migrate within the forebrain
              and
differentiate into neurons. The investigator has found that the birth,
              survival, and/or
differentiation of such cells in adult brains is influenced
              by both
environmental and hormonal factors.  His work will clarify the
              cellular and
physiological mechanisms which underlie the regulation of new
              cell
incorporation and address its functional significance.
Dr. Bittman will
              first determine whether removal of the testes eliminates the
influence of
              daylength on the number of newborn cells in specific brain
regions, and
              whether fluctuations in androgen secretion are necessary for
daylength to
              exert its effects. This work will establish whether daylength
and androgen
              interact to regulate this phenomenon. The investigator will next
              establish
whether the influences of the gonads and photoperiod on the
              incorporation
of new neurons in adulthood are attributable to regulation of
              cell birth,
programmed cell death, migration of newborn cells, or some
              combination of
these events. Finally, he will explore the possible functional
              role of
neurons born in adulthood. This will be accomplished by assessing
              the
activation of newborn cells in the processing of reproductively
              relevant
olfactory stimuli.
These experiments will elucidate environmental
              regulation of brain
plasticity and explore basic mechanisms regulating cell
              birth, migration,
and death which may prove useful in treatment of damaged or
              diseased
nervous systems.
