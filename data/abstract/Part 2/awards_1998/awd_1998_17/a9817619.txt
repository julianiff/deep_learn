Abstract    :
              This award supports the continued commitment by NSF and ASCE (American Society
              of Civil Engineers) to increase the number of women, minorities, and other
              under-represented groups entering the civil engineering professions.  The
              requested budget is primarily for speaker travel costs to the workshop, which
              will be held in conjunction with the ASCE National meeting in Boston in
              October, 1998.  Requested funds also support dissemination of conclusions.   
              The primary objectives of the workshop are:  1) to promote discussion about the
              current barriers limiting under-represented groups from entering and completing
              engineering programs; 2) to disseminate successful practices related to
              retention and recruitment to a broad audience of civil engineering educators
              and administrators; 3) to learn from experts how to best apply retention and
              recruitment practices at the university level; 4) to create an environment that
              promotes discussion, networking, and brainstorming; and 5) to provide a forum
              that enables practitioners, students, faculty, and administrators to share
              their ideas freely.
