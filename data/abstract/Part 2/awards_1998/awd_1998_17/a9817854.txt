ABSTRACT

This grant will support a special
              research panel to be presented at the 1999 West Coast Conference on Formal
              Linguistics (WCCFL), April 8-11, 1999, in Tucson, Arizona, on the topic "IS
              Language Derivational?"

This topic area is central to current linguistic
              research and theory.  The workshop will be open to all, including all
              registered participants at the general conference.  The talks at the workshop
              will be both state of the art reports, and catalysts for new research. 
              Attendance and participation by graduate students will be particularly
              encouraged.

Papers by workshop participants will be gathered together into a
              book manuscript, to be edited by the Co-Principal Investigators, and submitted
              to a major academic press in Fall 1999.
