The objectives of the research are to :  (1) develop novel
              assessment methodologies for evaluation of the risks and potential pay-offs of
              new technologies that avoid pollutant production;  ( 2) to demonstrate the
              methodology via a detailed case study of one promising new pollution prevention
              technology; and ( 3) to utilize a tiered approach including process simulation
              and design optimization, probabilistic analysis, life cycle analysis (LCA), and
              assessment of selected regional environmental impacts to provide insights
              regarding the risks and pay-offs of the pollution prevention approach, both at
              a micro process-level and at a macro regional environmental level. Variability
              and uncertainty in the inputs to the process models will be quantified as
              probability distributions.
The probabilistic process will be applied to model
              validation, analysis, and optimization case studies. The effect of life cycle
              changes on atmospheric transport and transformation of air pollutants, and
              subsequent health and other effects will be considered in an integrated
              assessment case study. This project will be jointly funded by NSF and
              EPA.
