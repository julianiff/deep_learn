PI:  Parshall, Karen V,

This grant supports a three-day
              symposium 27-29 May, 1999, entitled "Mathematics Unbound: The Evolution of an
              International Mathematical Community, 1800-1945," sponsored by the University
              of Virginia as part of its "Emphasis Year in the History of Mathematics."
              Co-organized by Karen Hunger Parshall (Departments of History and Mathematics,
              University of Virginia) and Adrian C. Rice (Middlesex University [UK]; Visiting
              Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia, 1998-1999),
              the symposium aims to shed light on the historical processes and interactions
              involved in the development of what has become an international community of
              mathematicians.
The symposium is divided into two parts:  nine
              forty-five-minute plenary lectures by established researchers on questions
              involving the internationalization of mathematics; and twelve twenty-minute
              talks by graduate students as well as junior and senior members of the field.
              Each day will culminate with a moderated discussion period.
Among the topics
              analyzed are:
---  the international influence of national institutions and
              standards of mathematics education;
---  the growth and dissemination of a
              shared research ethos;
---  the internationalization of national research
              outlets such as research journals and societies like the American Mathematical
              Society;
	     ---  the rise of international initiatives such as the
              International Congresses and the International Mathematical Union; and
--- 
              the role of refugee mathematicians in the internationalization of mathematical
              standards and research initiatives.
This meeting should allow historians of
              mathematics to take a major step forward in understanding the historical
              factors at work in the internationalization of mathematics. By bringing
              together an international group of established and aspiring scholars in the
              field of the history of mathematics, it should also provide a unique
              educational venue and an opportunity for students to meet and get to know some
              of the leaders in their field. Moreover, the resulting book-length volume will
              present a codification of those insights and will (the PIs hope) spur further
              research on the internationalization of mathematic in particular and of science
              in general by suggesting fruitful areas of historical exploration.
