ABSTRACT

Chomsky calls a 'Strong Minimalist
              Thesis' the conjecture that language 
is a perfect solution to interface
              conditions. The language faculty is 
thought to interact with other faculties
              of mind, including those responsible 
for articulation/perception and
              intentionality/conceptualization. That
interaction determines crucial
              properties of linguistic representations. In 
turn, the linguistic system is
              seen as computational, and optimal in the 
derivation of interface
              representations.    

The conjecture opens an obvious research program. To
              begin with, it forces
us to rethink many notions that sustained the Principles
              and Parameters
framework. For instance, we are not allowed to arbitrarily
              postulate levels
of representations or give mere notational conventions a deep
              ontological
status. More profoundly, if the linguistic system is
              computational, and
optimally so, derivational dynamics, crucially sensitive to
              complexity, 
should be responsible for a variety of effects which were
              previously taken 
to follow from static primitive conditions.

Whether the
              strong minimalist thesis is tenable will depend on how well it
explains the
              wealth of data that previous models accounted for, and how 
naturally it fits
              within the general enterprise of studying the human mind. 
The present
              research tries to undertake these goals within the Linguistics
Department at
              the University of Maryland, as well as its Cognitive Science
and Neuroscience
              program.
