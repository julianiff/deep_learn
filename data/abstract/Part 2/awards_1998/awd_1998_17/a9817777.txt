Abstract    :
              Chan - 9817777.   Certain geologic records provide natural archives of earth
              system processes and their history (ESH).  Regions where these records have
              been deposited have been particularly effected by rapidly expanding urban
              growth.  Many of the regions subject to urban degradation are likely to be of
              great societal value for educational, scientific, and practical reasons. The
              research project would develop, model, and implement strategies for managing
              interactions between archives of earth-system history and the urban landscape. 
              Ultimately this work would facilitate the development of a geosystem resources
              management ethic that would parallel existing cultural resources management
              ethic and foster the protection of important ESH archives.  Project activities
              will identify and described ESH archives in the Wasatch Front in Utah using a
              GIS database.  Spatial information on the dynamics of urban development will be
              merged with the ESH database to evaluate spatial interactions archives and
              development. Models will be developed for the Wasatch Front where current urban
              growth is extensive.  Natural archives in this area are likely to be strongly
              effected by this development and the region provides a ideal model system to
              investigate urban effects on these important resources.
