We are
              interested in how neurons, the basic building blocks of the brain, undergo
              specific changes after learning. We have chosen classical conditioning, a
              simple form of learning in which we learn to respond to our environment by
              relating one stimulus with another stimulus. The model we use is photoreceptors
              and hair cells of Hermissenda.  Neurons consist of two compartments, the cell
              body and axon. Previous studies have been conducted in the cell bodies of the
              photoreceptors in Hermissenda. Identification of memory-associated changes in
              the axons has not been studied. 
We hypothesize that conditioning produces
              axon-specific changes which are important for the ensuing behavior
              modifications.
To test this hypothesis we will determine the synaptic changes
              associated with classical conditioning in Hermissenda using
              electrophysiological techniques. These studies should lead to a better
              understanding of how changes in synaptic strength contribute towards memory in
              neurons. The significance of this project transcends the mechanisms of
              synapse-specific changes in conditioning-associated plasticity in Hermissenda,
              however.  Since the mechanisms wielded by neurons may be used in different
              forms by other systems, these studies may provide novel insights into such
              areas as photosensitivity, mechanosensitivity, neurotransmitter release
              mechanisms, and brain functions.
