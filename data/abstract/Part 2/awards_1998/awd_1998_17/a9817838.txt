Abstract    :
              The project of Professor James Haw of the University of Southern California,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to achieve a
              fundamental understanding of the catalytic reactions that occur on zeolites and
              metal oxides.  A special pulse quench catalytic reactor has been designed that
              allows the investigation of catalytic reactions by nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectrometry.  Real time changes in catalytic kinetics can be followed with
              this device with a time resolution of 0.2 s.  Theoretical calculations are also
              used to model adsorption, reaction, and spectroscopic properties, and to model
              the experimental NMR results.  A specific example that will be studied in this
              project is the catalytic conversion of ethylene to toluene on an acidic zeolite
              surface.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry is used to study the
              catalytic transformation of simple adsorbed gases into more complex molecules
              on zeolite and metal oxide surfaces.   Professor James Haw at the University of
              Southern California has developed a sample introduction system that allows such
              catalytic systems to be studied as they change in real time, compared to
              previous methods that required that the reaction be stopped and evaluated piece
              by piece.  The new analytical method will be used to study the industrially
              important transformation of ethylene to toluene on an acidified zeolite
              surface.
