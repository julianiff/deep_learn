Abstract    :
              This project from Professor Joel Harris at the University of Utah focuses on the
              development of analytical spectroscopic methods for the characterization of
              colloids and colloid-derived structures.  Time resolved photoluminescence
              spectroscopy will be used to probe surface photoreactions and their kinetics,
              vibrational spectroscopy will be used to monitor these surface reactions, and
              photon-burst techniques will be developed to determine particle
              sizes.

Finely dissolved solid materials dispersed in liquids are known as
              colloids.  Colloids are used in coatings, inks, and adhesives, as well as
              serving as the basis for many modern drug delivery systems.  The project work
              here uses modern analytical techniques to look at the chemical and physical
              properties of the colloidal particle surface, which determines whether the
              colloid is suitable for practical applications.
