This U.S.-Brazil award will support a planning visit by Dr.
              Maurice J. Tauber and Dr. Catherine A. Tauber of Cornell University, Ithaca,
              New York  to Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense in the state of  Rio de
              Janeiro, Brazil to meet with Dr. Gilberto S. Albuquerque, Associate Professor,
              Plant Protection Laboratory and  Professor Magali Hoffmann, curator, to develop
              a research project concerning the predator insect families of Chrysopidae and
              Hermerobiidaeas indicators of biodiversity  in Dessengano State Park.  In
              addition, Dr. Tauber will incorporate six (6) near-by field site visits to
              determine which four (4) sites will be most advantageous to a proposed
              collaborative study.
