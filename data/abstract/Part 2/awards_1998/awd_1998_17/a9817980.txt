Abstract    :
              
The transthylakoid pH gradient (delta pH) plays several critical roles in
              photosynthesis.  It drives the synthesis of ATP, controls photosynthetic
              electron transfer by slowing key reactions, and triggers feedback regulatory
              systems that protect reaction centers against photodamage.  In addition, large
              delta pH values are thought to sensitize photosystem II reaction centers to
              photoinhibition.  Despite a large number of studies, the quantitative
              relationships between delta pH and the processes it affects are poorly defined.
               The proposed work aims to address these issues by developing non-invasive
              probes of lumen and stromal pH to both in vitro and in vivo systems. 
              Preliminary work from other laboratories, as well as ours, has demonstrated
              that mutant versions of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP)
              can be used as rapidly responding intracellular pH probes, with a useful
              pH-sensitive ranges.  Expression of these probes will be targeted to 
the
              stromal and lumenal compartments of tobacco plants, allowing us to
              non-invasively probe the pH of these compartments.  We will then conduct
              experiments, using a prototype fluorimeter, to assess the utility of these
              probes to the investigation of pH changes in the lumen and stroma.
