Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for  Technical Activities Program of the
              Federal Facilities Council (FFC), operated through the Board on Infrastructure
              and the Constructed Environment (BICE), Commission on Technical and Engineered
              Systems (CETS), National Research Council.   The BICE provides overall guidance
              for the FFC program, and serves as a link between the sponsoring federal
              agencies and other elements of the building community, both national and
              international.    The Technical Activities Program was formulated by the FFC in
              consultation with members of seven standing committees and the Senior
              Representatives of the Sponsoring Agencies.  The program supports:  1)
              initiating three information studies focusing on performance measures; best
              practices in design review; and, integrating sustainable design, life-cycle
              costing, and value engineering in facility design; 2) convening four
              conferences and workshops on facility management-related topics; 3) publishing
              seven reports based on the studies and conferences, and 4) interagency
              coordination and networking activities among the member organizations.
