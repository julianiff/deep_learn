Abstract    :
              The Hecla Hoeck succession in Svalbard is one of the most complete and
              well-exposed late Neoproterozoic sections of carbonate rocks in the world. It
              contains the deposits of two glacial episodes and carbon-13 isotopic (d13C)
              evidence for two other glacial episodes.  This preservation is important
              because evidence suggests that events preceding the metazoan explosion were
              among the most extraordinary in Earth's history.   Prior research indicate that
              a series of runaway ice albedo catastrophes occurred with each one leading to a
              virtual collapse of biological productivity in the surface ocean for millions
              of years.  Stratigraphic evidence includes a unique association of glacial
              diamicrites, cap carbonates, and extreme d13C swings. The Principal
              Investigator will test the Neoproterozoic "snowball" Earth hypothesis in the
              Hecla Hoek succession in Svalbard.  He will use integrated sequence and
              chemostratigraphic tools successfully used in Neoproterozoic carbonates
              worldwide.  There is a strong possibility of unforeseen structural
              complications on such old rocks.  Therefore, he will address the classical
              problem of the "bottomless" Hecla Hoeck geosyncline by testing the hypothesis
              that a Caledonian extensional detachment separates the Neoproterozoic
              sedimentary succession of eastern Ny Friesland from the Caledonian metamorphic
              complex to the west.  This bears on the relationship between geon-18 basement
              to the west and geon-18 basement to the east.  This relationship is key to the
              reconstructions of the North Atlantic in the supercontinent Rodinia.  Existing
              paleogeographic reconstructions of this part of Rodinia are controversial, but
              they are believed to serve as boundary conditions for models of Neoproterozoic
              paleoclimate.  Argon-argon (4040-3940) stable isotope analyses will be used to
              establish the geochronolgy.
