Abstract    :
              Before the advent of digital information, attention to information integrity was
              the charge of a number of institutions - among them research libraries,
              publishers, and legal authorities. A major challenge in the digital age, and
              essential to the creation of digital libraries, is the creation of new
              mechanisms to ensure information integrity and new methods to administer those
              mechanisms. Information integrity, has three major characteristics:1)
              reliability, which ensures that information is available where and when people
              want it.; 2) security, which protects both the privacy rights of users of
              information and the intellectual property rights of content creators, and 3)
              preservation, which ensures the longevity of intellectual content for use by
              future generations.  Failure to create these will inevitably threaten the
              viability of all institutions - government, business, education, and defense -
              that rely on digital technology for their mission-critical information
              resources.

The Cornell Digital Library Project will investigate and develop
              working prototypes of a digital library architecture with particular attention
              to supporting these integrity issues. The architecture will build on the notion
              of reusable components, which focus on the critical realities and benefits of
              the networked environment, global distribution, federation of content and
              services distributed among multiple administrative entities, and extension
              where- new components and capabilities can be added to the architecture to suit
              community-specific requirements or in response to new technologies.
