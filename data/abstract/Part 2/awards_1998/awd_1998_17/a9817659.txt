Abstract    :
              Abstract:  This award provides partial travel support and local expenses for 10
              new researchers and 5 of the invited speakers at the conference on "Statistics:
               Modeling of Processes in Science and Industry" being held in conjunction with
              the 50th anniversary of the Department of Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute and State University (Virginia Tech).  The theme reflects the
              research accomplishments and philosophy of the department, which encourages
              interaction between theory and applications.  The main objective is the search
              for general principles of statistical modeling as they evolve from specific
              applications in different subject matter fields.  The conference will provide a
              forum for discussion of these ideas and establish communication between well
              established and new researchers.  The timing on the heel of the annual joint
              statistical meetings in Baltimore should facilitate the travel logistics for
              potential attendees.  Sessions planned will cover:  Process and Quality
              Control, Experimental Design, Medical and Biopharmaceutical Statistics, Linear
              Mixed Models, Bayesian Statistics, Nonparametric Estimation, and Survey
              Sampling.
