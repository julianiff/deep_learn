Abstract    :
              Inorganic building materials have shaped the evolution of groups such as
              mollusks and vertebrates. The evolutionary importance of the calcium minerals
              in the shells and skeletons of these organisms and the iron and silicon
              minerals employed in, for example, mollusc teeth and the skeletons of
              radiolarians is well understood.  In contrast, the significance of heavy metals
              in structural material is, at present, unexplored. Heavy metals are found
              widely in the business ends of the jaws, claws and other "tools" of many
              arthropods and worms. These structures may contain up to 25% (by mass) of
              uncommon heavy metals such as zinc, manganese and copper. The PIs propose to
              begin to study the form, function and physiology of this material. The
              microscopic form of this material will be investigated using electron
              microscopy. In order to establish a possible function, the PIs will test
              mechanical properties of this material using atomic force microscopy. Finally,
              the PIs will use high- energy ion microscopy to begin studying the physiology
              of this phenomenon by tracking the distribution of zinc through the
              metamorphosis of ants. The research proposed here will thus be first steps in
              understanding this wide-spread biological phenomenon with unknown but
              potentially important significance in the biology, ecology and the evolutionary
              history of these organisms.
