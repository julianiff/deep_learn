Abstract    :
              Copperating Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities in Engineering (CHROME)
              network of community
organization, founded 1983, impacts students in
              elementary, middle and high school.  This proposal does a fine job of outlining
              how CHROME meets each criteria while specifically highlighting CHROME
              activities and successes.  As a result of it clubs throughout the K-12 school
              system, this program is able to 'follow through"
with youngsters and offer a
              variety of support and activities.  As a result, CHROME claims "virtually all
              students who remain" in the program graduate high school.  CHROME claims 95
              percent of its club members go to college and 80 percent major in SMET or
              related fields proven by conducting a follow-up survey with alumni and
              maintaining a database.  CHROME's ability to track students demonstrates how
              the program has made a difference in students graduating, going to college and
              choosing majors in SMET fields. While this program mostly benefits African
              American students, there are a number of other minorities who participate in
              the program including Hispanic, Asian/Filipino, and Native American students. 
              The strengths of the nominee include:  Sixty community organizations working
              together providing outstanding programs for youth and students.
