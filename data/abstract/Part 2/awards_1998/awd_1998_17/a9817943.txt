This project is an empirical investigation into Japanese men's
              informal linguistic behavior. A review of the Japanese language and gender
              research reveals that, although some aspects of these issues have been
              well-studied, an investigation into how Japanese men in same-sex friendship
              groups create conversations has yet to be tried. Data will be drawn from
              approximately thirty-six Japanese male speakers in the Kansai region. The goals
              are twofold: 1) to examine the specific array of linguistic devices used by
              Japanese men to create conversations and 2) to explore how Japanese men use
              these local linguistic structures to express themselves in ways which exhibit
              principled linkages to global cultural notions of what it is to be a Japanese
              man.

Quantitative and qualitative analyses are integrated in order to
              identify particular linguistic patterns utilized by Japanese men and to
              determine how these patterns connect to larger issues of Japanese masculine
              identity. This project will contribute to linguistic anthropological as well as
              language and gender research by examining how men express themselves through
              language and how linguistic structures are valued in specific
              contexts.
