This award supports a study that examines the extent to
              which changes are occurring in private sector firms that engage in cooperative
              research with colleges and universities and how, if at all, any changes are
              affecting the willingness of the firms to support academic research centers. 
              One of the major hypotheses is that there has been a broad reorientation of the
              private sector's attitude toward generic research for a variety of reasons,
              resulting in less interest in or need to provide financial support of
              university research. The project objectives are (1) to assess changes in the
              level of funds provided by the private sector to industry-university research
              centers; and (2) to identify the organizational and economic factors that have
              contributed to the observed trends in the availability of funds to support
              center research.  Since the project's emphasis is on the management of research
              in industry, the focus will be established firms, not small-firm conduct and
              management.  The agencies, universities, and researchers involved in the
              hundreds of industry-university research centers funded by Federal Government
              programs should benefit substantially through a better understanding of what
              pressures, requirements, and interests affect the extent and manner in which
              firms participate in such enterprises.
