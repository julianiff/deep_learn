Abstract    :
              The original study by this team of investigators sought support to design an
              evaluation that is GPRA-oriented to assess the effects of the Rural Systemic
              Program.  It will involve intra- and inter-comparisons of current RSIs serving
              primarily the American Indian population to determine program outcomes/impacts
              for students, teachers, administrators, community and business.  The first
              phase of this project (Year One) will focus on designing a GPRA-based
              evaluative study, linking it to exisiting data collection efforts, identifying
              information gaps and developing the needed data collection measures and
              procedures to be responsive to GPRA and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
              RSI program with the American Indian cultures.  Data collection and analysis
              and reporting of results would occur in Years 2 and 3.
