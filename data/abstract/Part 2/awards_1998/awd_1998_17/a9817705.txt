Abstract    :
              This is a pilot project that will investigate the feeding patterns of a small,
              nocturnal primate of Indonesia; the spectral tarsier.   It is hypothesized that
              these animals are gregarious foragers.  If this is true, then two predictions
              follow: that individuals will not encounter one another at random throughout
              the night and 2) that individuals will be observed in proximity while foraging.
               

Both behavioral and positional data will be gathered to test the
              hypotheses.  Test animals will be habituated, trapped and radio collared. 
              Several sampling procedures will be used to assure appropriate data will be
              gathered on the behavioral and spatial distribution of the animals.  

If it
              is demonstrated that the spectral tarsier is a gregarious forager further
              support will be sought in order to determine the proximate and distal causes of
              this behavior.  Is it predator pressure, the temporal distribution of resources
              or infanticide avoidance that determines this foraging behavior?
