Abstract    :
              The focus of this research  will follow three major themes. First, extensive
              structure activity relationships will be established in the formation of
              hydrogen bond stabilized aggregates synthesized as supercritical carbon
              dioxide-derived gels .  Second,  functionality will be incorporated into the
              aggregates so that the potential for novel recognition and catalytic properties
              can be realized.   Third, ordered assemblies with controlled pore size in
              solution will be investigated with application to the preparation of
              supercritical carbon dioxide-derived aerogels.  

With this renewal award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
              Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton from the Department of Chemistry at Yale University. 
              Professor Hamilton will focus his work on the development of hydrogen bonding
              as a route to controlling the structure and properties of molecular aggregates
              in solution, in the solid state and in the formation of both xerogels and
              aerogels.  It is probable that materials for real-world applications will arise
              from this approach.
