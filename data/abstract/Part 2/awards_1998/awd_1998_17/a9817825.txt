Abstract    :
              9817825  Wiegel    The production of radioisotopes has resulted in large amounts
              of highly radioactive waste.  At the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site
              (SRS), about 700 million curies are stored in tanks of 750,000 to 1,300,000 US
              gallons.  It had been assumed that the high levels of radiation and the highly
              alkaline pH in these carbon-steel, single-shell tanks would prevent microbial
              growth.  Bacteria were recently discovered in some corroded, leaking tanks; it
              is possible that some of the corrosion is due to biological processes.  Life
              forms that can simultaneously withstand the high radioactivity, elevated
              temperatures, and alkaline pH in these tanks are unknown to science.    In this
              SGER research, Juergen Wiegels, Lawrence Shimkets, and Carl Fliermans are to
              obtain microbial cultures from an SRS high level waste tank.  They wish to show
              that liquid samples can be aseptically and safely collected from such tanks;
              that bacteria will colonize substrates (coupons) placed in the tank, and that
              these coupons can be safely and efficiently retrieved; that the retrieved
              bacteria can be cultivated, and will grow in high-radiation environments; that
              the cultures can be maintained in media sufficiently low in radioactivity to
              permit further manipulation; that 16S rDNA sequences can be obtained from these
              bacteria and used to characterize their phylogenetic position.  Success in
              these activities would make what looks like one of the most unique assemblages
              of microbes, and one that would have significance for genetics, molecular
              evolution, and biodeterioration studies, available for further investigation.
