This is a 12-month award proposed by Dr. Peter Chen,
              Louisiana State University, and Dr. Tok Wang Ling, the National University of
              Singapore.  Dr. Chen requests funds for 11 U.S. scientists to travel to
              Singapore to attend the joint workshop on databases and Internet ion November
              19-20, 1998.  The workshop is aimed at gaining insights into the implementation
              of and experimentation with database systems interconnected via the Internet
              over a wide-area environment.  The topic of this workshop is timely and
              worthwhile, especially because Singapore was recently linked to NSF's vBNS
              network.  This project is jointly supported by the National University of
              Singapore, the Singapore Science and Technology Board, and the NSF.
