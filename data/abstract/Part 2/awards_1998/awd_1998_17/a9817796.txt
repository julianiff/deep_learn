ABSTRACT

Funds will be used for development of the
              Phase Diverse Speckle (PDS) technique for the post-detection correction of
              aberration of solar images due to atmospheric fluctuations.  The effort will
              extend the utility of the PDS technique to narrow-band, polarimetric, and
              spectroscopic data sets.  Novel reconstruction algorithms that employ optimal
              and unified estimators will be developed by analogy to current PDS algorithms. 
              In addition, refinements to current algorithms with regard to regularization
