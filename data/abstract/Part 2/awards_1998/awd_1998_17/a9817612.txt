Abstract    :
              Kastner  OCE-9817612    The Pis will conduct research on the concentration of
              trace gases  in seafloor methane hydrates and on dating them with
              state-of-the-art geochemical instrumentation.  Dating hydrates is essential for
              under-  standing the mechanisms and rates of hydrate formation and dissociation
                and because methane hydrates constitute a major transient sink of oceanic
              carbon.  Pb-210/Pb-206, C-14, CfC11/12, Kr-85 and Th-230 analyses are planned.
