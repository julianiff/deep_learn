Because of the importance of pressure in understanding both
              the possible origin and continued survival of life in extreme environments, we
              propose this study of high-pressure, hydrothermal organic chemistry.  The
              principal objectives of the proposed research are to refine in-situ
              hydrothermal experimental techniques and to establish a foundation of knowledge
              regarding organic synthesis reactions in subsurface hydrothermal environments -
              a well-recognized need and opportunity in the study of life in extreme
              environments (stated explicitly in Holm et al., 1992, and implicitly in
              National Research Council, 1990).  Toward this end, we propose to develop and
              apply spectroscopic methods to monitor the rates and pathways of hydrothermal
              organic reactions as a function of relevant variables, including pressure,
              temperature, pH, and H2 cells, of a type that has been designed, built, and
              tested at the Geophysical Laboratory.

The project focuses on in-situ
              monitoring of high-pressure, hydrothermal organic reactions.  This work
              involves the application of hydrothermal pressure cells, Raman spectroscopy,
              and optical microscopy to assess pathways and rates of organic reactions in
              real time.  We propose to focus on three tasks during this project: (1) design
              and construction of hydrothermal diamond cells; (2) development of in situ
              monitoring techniques to study hydrothermal organic reactions; and (3)
              hydrothermal reaction studies.
