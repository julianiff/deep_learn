ScienceGate III is the third in a series of conferences of
              developers of comprehensive high school science curricula to explore the
              connections between disciplinary curricula.  Previous conferences have
              concentrated on a common vision about the nature of science and how science is
              taught and on common issues of evaluation and dissemination.  This conference
              focuses on the role of the teacher in the development and implementation of
              materials.  Professional development necessary to teach the materials is
              discussed.
