Abstract    :
              The object of this research is the exploration and  development of a new method
              for estimating and correcting  phase aberrations in coherent imaging systems;
              it fits into  the SGER guidelines as an application of new expertise or  new
              approaches to "established" research topics. Some  preliminary aspects of our
              new methodology have been  verified for medical ultrasound type systems by both
               computer simulations and actual ultrasound experiments with  a phantom in a
              water tank. The successful development of  these novel adaptive autofocusing
              methods will improve the  quality of phase aberration degraded images in a
              variety of  coherent imaging modalities. The proposal tasks will focus  on
              medical ultrasound and spotlight synthetic aperture radar  coherent imaging
              modalities. These tasks will involve: the  development of simulation test beds;
              simulation testing and  optimization of algorithms; and the analysis of
              experimental  emulation studies to validate the developed physical models  and
              algorithms.
