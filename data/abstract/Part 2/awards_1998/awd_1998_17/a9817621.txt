Abstract    :
              Production of acrylamide utilizing enzymatic hydration of 
acrylonitrile offers
              a number of economic and environmental 
advantages, and serves as a first
              example of a "green" process for 
production of an extensively-utilized
              commodity chemical.  The 
enzyme-based process offers significant cost and
              environmental 
advantages over the traditional chemical process, but is
              hindered 
by temperature-dependent inactivation of the nitrile hydratase
              
catalyst by the acrylonitrile substrate.  The hypothesis to be 
tested in
              this project is that molecular characterization of the 
nitrile hydratase
              inactivation by acrylonitrile with a new 
thermophile isolate BR444 and
              subsequent enzyme alteration using 
site-directed mutation will provide a more
              acrylonitrile-resistant 
enzyme.  The project is expected to provide basic
              information 
regarding enzyme resistance to alkylation in addition to possible
              
improved catalysts for acrylamide bioproduction.  This award is made
by NSF
              as part of the joint NSF/EPA Program on Technologies for a
Sustainable
              Environment.
