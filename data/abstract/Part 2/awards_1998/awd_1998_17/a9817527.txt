Using the Informedia Digital Video Library to Author Multimedia
              Material 

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. 
              This project will create a comprehensive Intelligent Video Editor that will
              allow people without special training to author interesting compositions using
              digital video.  In particular, the editor will support sophisticated
              interactive behaviors for the videos and for extra graphical drawings (called
              synthetic graphics) layered on top of the videos.  For example, users might
              specify which objects in the video can be clicked on to choose the next video
              clip, or that an arrow should be drawn that shows the path that an object will
              follow, or that the video is part of a lesson and a viewer's answer to a
              question determines the next action.  There will also be high-level facilities
              for searching and organizing videos, video editing, demonstrating behaviors,
              writing scripts in a more natural programming language, and testing and
              debugging the code.  The tools created will be continuously tested with school
              children and adults to evaluate and refine the various features.  The goal is
              to make it as easy to use the video material found in a digital library as it
              is to use textual material found in today's libraries.
