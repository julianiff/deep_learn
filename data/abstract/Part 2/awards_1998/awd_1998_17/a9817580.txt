This project will bring together representatives from higher
              education, the community, businesses, and administrators and teachers from the
              Washington, DC Public Schools to plan and prepare a teacher leadership project
              in science for middle schools.  A critical need has been documented through
              teacher and school survey of the need to bring about reform in science
              instruction at the middle school levels (i.e., 6-8).  A teacher leadership
              project will be planned to provide teacher leaders in Washington, DC public
              schools that will assist in working with science teachers, mentoring them,
              assisting and directing inservice workshops, and facilitating change using
              classroom change models.

The planning process builds upon preliminary work
              already completed.  By bringing together all stakeholders in the DC publci
              schools, including representatives of other funded science programs at the
              elementary level, a comprehensive vertical alignment of teaching strategies and
              science curriculum implementation will be developed and established to begin to
              bring about major change in the Washington, DC public Schools' science program.
