This research project will explore the synthesis of new
              solid-state chalcogenides using special low melting fluxes with an emphasis on
              understanding materials crystal structures and properties.  A focus will be on
              controlling the stabilization of particular structrual building blocks,
              learning how to rationally stabilize quaternary and quinternary chalcogenide
              compounds, exploring new reaction types, and studying the nature of new charge
              density waves and superstructures occurring in some layered
              tellurides.

The development of new solid-state synthetic tools often
              leads to exciting new materials with useful properties of high interest to the
              device physics community.  The materials developed will be routinely screened
              for various important chemical and physical properties, and promising materials
              will be studied further and their potential applications evaluated.
