Abstract    :
              The computing Research Association will host a meeting of principal
              investigators on NSF-funded networking research grants.  The purpose of the
              meeting to exchange information about research results, and explore possible
              new questions and priorities in the areas of data communication.  The meeting,
              to be held in Washington, DC in late fall of 1998, will bring together about
              125 PI's on research grants supported by the Advanced Networking Research and
              Special Projects Programs of the Advanced Networking Infrastructure and
              Research Division (ANIR).  The principal purpose of the meeting will be to
              improve communication among the networking research PI's, and much of the
              discussion will be sharing information about work in process.  A report on the
              meeting will be published, and CRA will establish a meeting web page to provide
              participants convenient access to slides and presentation notes.
