This project is for work aimed at calculating and
              understanding the physical properties of strongly-interacting many-electron
              systems.  It includes both numerical and phenomenological analytic calculations
              for basic lattice Hamiltonians such as the Heisenberg, Hubbard, and t-J models.
               These models exhibit a wide range of phases including antiferromagnetism,
              charge density waves, superconductivity, domain wall formation, and phase
              separation that are descriptive of similar behavior in many materials with
              technologically important magnetic and superconducting properties.  The goal of
              this work is to understand the basic mechanisms and competition that lead to
              this rich array of phases and to develop reliable ways of calculating their
              properties.
%%%
Many novel materials with magnetic and superconducting
              properties of potential technological and commercial importance, such as
              high-temperature superconductors, cannot be adequately described by theoretical
              models for the electronic structure that assume a mean-field behavior for the
              interactions between electrons.  Such systems require the use of models which
              incorporate explicit correlation effects between electrons.  This research aims
              to improve our understanding of the electronic properties of materials where
              many-electron effects dominate the interesting electronic properties, and will
              be critical in advancing the development and use of such technologically
              important materials.
