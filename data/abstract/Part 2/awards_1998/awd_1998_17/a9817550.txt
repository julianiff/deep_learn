Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new class of organoboron
              chiral auxiliaries for use in organic synthesis.  The reagent is derived from
              pinene,  a plentiful and inexpensive "chiral pool" material.  Potential
              applications to a variety of asymmetric reactions will be explored, including
              the aldol, allylation and hydroboration reactions.  Other possible applications
              to be explored include asymmetric alkynylborations of aldehydes, which give
              optically active propargyl alcohols.  

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. John A.
              Soderquist of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio
              Piedras.  Professor Soderquist's research is in the important area of producing
              chiral molecules, which are ever-important as pharmaceutical agents.  The
              method that is employed by Dr. Soderquist uses pinene as a natural chiral
              template, and boron chemistry to mediate the transfer of chirality from the
              pinene into the molecule that is being formed.
