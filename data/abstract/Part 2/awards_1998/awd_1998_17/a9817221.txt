               William Green       Affiliation:                       Massachusetts Institute
              of        Technology                     This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program        sub-element of the Interfacial,
              Transport and Separations Program of        the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. William Green at the
              Massachusetts Institute of        Technology.  New technology is developed to
              remove sulfur compounds        from gasoline and fuel oils. Traditionally,
              sulfur removal is done        through catalytic technologies using
              hydrodesulfurization catalysts.        The alternate route studied here
              involves the selective binding of        these compounds to functionalized
              magnetic particles. These functional        moieties attached to the magnetic
              particles are either polymers and/or        surfactants adsorbed onto the
              particle surface. Various schemes for        the selective extraction of the
              sulfur compounds onto the particles        are considered. The final objective
              is incorporation of the sulfur        compounds into the adsorbed layers of the
              particles. The particles are        then removed through a magnetic field
              gradient, regenerated and cycled        back.               This technology of
              sulfur removal could be extremely cost effective        since it does not
              involve high temperature reaction or multiphase        extraction. The
              application of such technology could result in a        paradigm shift for the
              petroleum and fuel processing industries.
