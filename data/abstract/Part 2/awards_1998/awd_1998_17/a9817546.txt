Abstract    :
              For groups to make high quality decisions members must have some proficiency at
              evaluating individual contributions to the discussion.  Recent research
              indicates that groups have some proficiency at making these assessments even on
              highly uncertain estimation tasks.  Subsequent investigation have demonstrated
              that groups can bec ome better at this with the assistance of strategic
              guidance or feedback.  These findings suggest the interaction cues and
              strategies that groups use when reaching consenus have some degree of validity.
               While a few studies have investigated how groups can become better at
              evaluating member competence, no research has explored what cues and strategies
              are actually being relied on to make these assessments.  The purpose of the
              proposed research is to investigate the group judgment process by developing
              and validating an observational coding system for identifying that cues and
              strategies used during group interaction.  Results will shed light on the
              nature of the group judgment process and will help guide the design of group
              training interventions.  In the long term, this research program is intended to
              advance our knowledge of group decision making across a wide variety of
              experimental and applied contexts.
