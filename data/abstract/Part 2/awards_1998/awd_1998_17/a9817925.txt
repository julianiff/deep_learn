Abstract    :
              
In this study detailed gas-phase kinetics for the production of GaN films in a
              chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process will be developed.  The focus will be
              on the homogeneous gas-phase reactions that occur during CVD of GaN from NH3,
              and trimethylgallium and from NH3 and triethylgallium.  Two experimental
              methods will be used: (1) laser powered homogeneous pyrolysis will be employed
              for the gas-phase kinetics and (2) optical imaging of vertical concentration
              profiles above growth surfaces will be used for investigations of important
              growth species.  Reactive intermediate concentration profiles will be imaged
              using laser induced fluorescence.  This experimental program will be
              complemented with ab initio molecular orbital calculations in combination with
              transition state theories to estimate rate coefficients for less important
              reactions not determined in the experimental studies. 
The gas-phase mechanism
              developed in this project will be combined with literature information on
              surface reactions and incorporated into a CVD reactor model. These studies are
              relevant to the development of GaN light emitting diodes and diode lasers for
              lighting, for optical data storage and for other applications.  GaN is grown
              commercially by CVD; however, most techniques have been developed by empirical
              means.  This study should contribute to a fundamental  understanding of the
              basic processes.
