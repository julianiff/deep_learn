Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project will examine American debates about the
              Arctic in the late nineteenth century. In particular, it will trace three
              nested debates concerning: theories of Arctic geography, the legitimacy of
              explorers as scientific practitioners, and the value of Arctic science and
              exploration. Taken together, these debates demonstrate the close and complex
              interactions of scientific and popular culture in the late nineteenth century,
              and suggest revisions to our current analysis of the "rise" of American
              science. Specifically, debates over the Arctic reveal that 1) Arctic explorers
              operated from a position "between" scientific and popular cultures, mediating
              the flow of knowledge and authority about the Arctic, and that 2) despite the
              growing cultural authority of the scientific community in the late nineteenth
              century, public views about science and its practitioners frequently diverged
              from the views of scientific elites. While most analyses of Arctic science have
              focused on the activities of explorers in the Arctic, this dissertation
              research follows explorers through the institutions and lecture halls of
              America, where they built support for their expeditions among the elite
              scientific community as well as public audiences. In tracing the shifting
              scientific and social positions of Arctic explorers in American culture, the
              research will reveal a broader struggle over scientific authority between
              elites and "popular scientists" in the last half of the nineteenth
              century.
