This project, sponsored by the Tulsa Public Schools, will
              carry out a planning project which will prepare the schools in the Tulsa Public
              School District to prepare a full proposal for a systemic change project. The
              project intends, among other things, to research models and best practices in
              K-12 mathematics and science education, study the integration of technology in
              the schools, visit on-going successful systemic sites and hold focused group
              meetings to garner support for school reform.
