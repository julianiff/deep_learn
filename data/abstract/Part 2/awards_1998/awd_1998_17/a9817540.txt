This is a grant for a 2-day conference designed as a
              national forum for discussing issues involving early childhood mathematics,
              with a particular focus on mathematics content and the PreK-2 Standards of the
              Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM, 1998).  The conference
              will provide a forum for thoughts and ideas relative to understanding and
              implementation of the PSSM for PreK-2 students as well as ideas for
              instructional materials.  The conference will be co-sponsored by the EXXON
              Foundation.  It will be preceded by several months of planning.  Conference
              proceedings will be compiled as a way to disseminate the results of the
              conference.  Conference participants will include mathematicians, mathematics
              educators, early childhood educators, and others central to curriculum issues
              involving young people.  The conference will be limited to 100 participants.
