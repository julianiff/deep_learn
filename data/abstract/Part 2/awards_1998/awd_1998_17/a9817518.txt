Abstract    :
              This proposal is to build, maintain and evaluate a a software and data
library
              for experiments, simulations, and archiving primarily for the
social and
              economic sciences.  It will serve as a "Web-Lab Library," and
multi-functional
              knowledge center.  There will be a library of software for
experiments at the
              Website to support theoretically driven experimentation
and a library of
              simulation programs for research and education.  Data from
current experiments
              will be recorded and automatically archived. The
archiving format will be
              extensible to support inclusion of data from prior
experiments.  Innovative
              data retrieval and display systems will be
developed.

The Web-Lab Library
              will be developed by a Hub at the University of South
Carolina and two
              associated Collaboratories at the University of Iowa and
Georgia State
              University. The Hub supports programmers with substantial
knowledge and
              experience of social science research.  The social scientists
at the Hub and
              Collaboratories will develop designs for the Web-Lab
Library. All will conduct
              experiments-at-a-distance to test software as it
is developed
