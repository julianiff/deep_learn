Abstract    :
              An integrative conference on forkhead/winged helix proteins will be held at the
              Scripps Research Institute November 14-17, 1998.  Winged helix/forkhead
              proteins from a family of transcriptional regulators that play key roles in
              development, cancer and in aging.  Scientists from the US, Europe, and Japan,
              working on diverse aspects of forkhead/winged helix proteins will attend the
              converence to exchange information and initiate interdisciplinary
              collaborations.  An important aspect of the meeting will be to include and
              encourage graduate students and young scientists to participate and join
              challenging investigations on the structure and transcriptional regulatory
              functions of forkhead/winged helix proteins and on the roles of these proteins
              in determining organ development, cell growth and aging.
