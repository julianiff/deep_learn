Title:  "Contributions of the
              perirhinal cortex and hippocampus to 
Olfactory, auditory, and contextual fear
              conditioning"

 A remarkable degree of progress in identifying and
              characterizing the ways in which the brain forms and stores memories,
              particularly memories of emotionally significant events, has arisen from the
              study of Pavlovian conditioning in rats. Accumulating data indicate that two
              brain areas, the rhinal cortices and the hippocampus, may participate
              critically in the acquisition and maintenance of emotional memories. In an
              attempt to reconcile several extant controversies regarding the ways in which
              these brain areas contribute to emotional learning, the proposed studies will
              take advantage of several well-characterized Pavlovian conditioning paradigms
              to explore the effects of discrete pretraining lesions of these areas on the
              acquisition and maintenance of the associations between olfactory or auditory
              stimuli and mildly aversive events. The brain areas under investigation in this
              project are among the most severely damaged in humans suffering from
              Alzheimer's disease. These areas also appear to play a particularly prominent
              role in a variety of different types of learning in both human and nonhuman
              mammalian species. Together the results of these studies will provide answers
              to fundamental questions regarding the contributions of rhinal cortex and
              hippocampus to emotional learning and memory specifically and to the ways in
              which these brain areas contribute to learning and memory processes in
              general.
