DLI-Phase 2: Digital Workflow Management: The Lester S. Levy Digitized
              Collection of Sheet Music, Phase Two.

This project will seek to enhance the
              use and usability of  the Eisenhower Library's Lester S. Levy Collection of
              Sheet Music and similar collections located elsewhere.  The Eisenhower Library
              previously digitized this collection of more than 29,000 pieces of American
              popular sheet music spanning the years 1780 to 1960. The sheet music in this
              collection provides a social commentary on American life and a distinctive
              record of
their time.

The project will create sound renditions and enhanced
              search capabilities for the collection. Audio files and full-text lyrics are
              being created using optical music recognition software written by staff from
              the Peabody Conservatory at Hopkins.  Workflow managing tools will be developed
              to reduce and focus human labor.  The activities will result in a tested
              process, framework, and set of tools transferable for use with other
              large-scale digitization projects.
