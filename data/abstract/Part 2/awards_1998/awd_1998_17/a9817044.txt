This project compares the processes of rapid social change among two
              Aleut communities: one in the Pribilof Islands (under U.S. jurisdiction) and
              the other in the Commandor Islands (under Russian jurisdiction).  Both
              communities have experienced profound economic and social pressures, yet have
              retained crucial aspects of Aleut cultural identity, primarily in the form of
              language and oral traditions of the Aleut elders.  The project includes
              interviews, participant observation, documentary film production, and photo
              documentation.  An important element of the work is the researchers'
              partnership with both Aleut communities.
