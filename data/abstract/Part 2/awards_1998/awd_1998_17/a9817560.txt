Title:
              Comparative Study of Phanerozoic Climates

This award supports research on
              the comparative study of Phanerozoic climates.  The primary effort is focused
              on modeling studies involving both the last glacial maximum and the
              Carboniferous, Ordovician, and late Precambrian glaciations.  Specific research
              efforts include: (1) comparison of model-predicted land temperatures for the
              last glacial maximum with data from the low latitudes; (2) in-depth coupled
              climate-ice sheet model studies of carboniferous, Ordovician, and late
              Precambrian glaciations; (3) initial climate-ice sheet model simulation of
              Phanerozoic ice volume levels for 20 different time intervals; and (4)
              synthesis of results across time scales in order to check for self-consistency
              in model estimates of global climate sensitivity.  The ultimate aim of this
              research is to work toward development of a uniform theory for glaciation in
              earth history that is consistent with observations, employs the minimum number
              of adjustable parameters, and yields a climate sensitivity consistent with
              estimates from other time intervals.
