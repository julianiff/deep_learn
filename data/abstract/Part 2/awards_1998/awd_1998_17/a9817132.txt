Abstract    :
              

Understanding the development of organisms entails understanding how cell
              division is controlled.  While a great deal has been learned about the
              regulation of the cell cycle, much less is known about how a developing
              organism controls the rate and location of cell division activity.  This
              project aims to deepen our knowledge of how a growing plant organ controls the
              spatial distribution of cell division, by using as a model the root meristem of
              Arabidopsis thaliana.  The project will test hypotheses about the regulation of
              cell division, specifically addressing how cells decide to stop dividing.  Do
              cells stop dividing when they start expanding too rapidly or when their volume
              becomes too great?  Although this project uses plants as experimental material,
              much of what is known about how cell division is controlled in plants appears
              to be true also for animals.  When animal cells fail to stop dividing, the
              result can be cancer; thus the findings from this project may apply not only to
              optimizing plant growth for agriculture but might ultimately apply to
              minimizing the threat of cancer.
