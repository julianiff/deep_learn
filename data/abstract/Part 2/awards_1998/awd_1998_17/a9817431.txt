Abstract    :
              9817431
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be
              to construct a pair of high-field hybrid dipole magnets.  In Phase I the
              analytical techniques and general design methodology were developed to produce
              large, high precision, high-field (up to 1.8 T) hybrid iron-yoke/rare-earth
              dipole magnets.  These new tools were then applied  to designing a 1 T tunable
              field 'box' dipole with a reversed fringe field to be used in a compact 70 MeV
              recirculating electron accelerator.  The Phase II research will be directed
              toward  constructing these magnets, based on the Phase I design, which  will
              then be installed and tested in the accelerator.
     Large, high-field hybrid
              rare-earth dipole magnets can be used in industrial and research accelerators,
              beam transport lines, and spectrometers, as their construction is simpler than,
              and their performance is superior to, conventional electromagnets.  Eliminating
              magnet coils and their power supplies reduces the electrical power consumption,
              servicing costs, control system complexity, and space requirements while
              increasing the reliability at a capital expenditure comparable to that of
              conventional electromagnets.
