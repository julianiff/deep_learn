Abstract    :
              Bradforth is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to use
              ultrafast spectroscopic methods to explore the role and magnitude of the
              solvent effect on chemical reaction dynamics in solution.  The following
              studies will be carried out: (1) electron photodetachment via transitions to
              charge transfer to solvent states (CTTS), and (2) solution photodissociation of
              neutral molecules for which the isolated molecule dynamics have been
              extensively characterized both experimentally and theoretically.   A newly
              developed < 50 femtosecond tunable light source in the photochemically
              important  245-350 nanometer region will allow benchmark chemical systems to be
              examined.  In addition, new graduate level courses that incorporate
              spectroscopy and molecular dynamics in the time domain will be developed.
              Outcomes from the research effort are expected to permit quantitative
              comparisons to theory, forming a basis for understanding the details of
              chemical reactions in solution. 
 
Much important chemistry takes place in
              liquids. When chemical reactions occur in liquid solutions, the liquid that
              surrounds the reacting molecules can affect the reaction outcomes
              significantly.  In this project, solution chemistry will be examined on the
              timescales of atomic motion in molecules.  Results from this project will lead
              to new insights into how molecules react in water and other liquids.
