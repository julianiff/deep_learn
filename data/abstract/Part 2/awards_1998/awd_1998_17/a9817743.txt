The researchers would use remote-sensing images from
              1982-98 to document urban change in six African cities and contrast what
              happens in urban areas with development in urban hinterlands.  In work weighted
              toward the poorer sections of the cities, households would be interviewed to
              learn about livelihood strategy histories, relationships to natural resource
              use, and impacts of changes in urban structure.The results would be used to
              assess the effects of various projects and to initiate hypotheses that could be
              tested in later studies.  A preliminary hypothesis is that the process of
              urbanization in arid Africa has produced a new poor, people whose lives are
              shaped more by collective use of aid than by individual maximizing behavior. 
              If this is true, the information can be used in urban planning as well as in
              furthering the understanding of African urbanization.
