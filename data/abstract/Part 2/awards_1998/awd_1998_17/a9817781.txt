Abstract    :
              Balling - 9817781.  There has been substantial debate in the scientific
              community and elsewhere regarding the climatic and ecological effects of a
              continuing buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  This project propose that
              urban areas represent meso-scale, real-world examples of what happens at high
              atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide.  Such high levels have been demonstrated
              in a pilot project in Phoenix Arizona and this study will investigate the
              spatial and temporal dynamics of this urban carbon-dioxide dome, assess its
              effects, and evaluate how human activities influence the distribution of carbon
              dioxide near Phoenix and cities in general.  This will be an interdisciplinary
              study with three phases.  1)  It will make detailed measurements of local CO2
              concentrations, high resolution meteorological observations, land-use patterns
              and human activities within Phoenix.  2)  It will determine the influence of
              local meteorological conditions on the temporal and spatial distribution of CO2
              and consider the interaction between this greenhouse gas and local temperature
              conditions.  3)  It will integrate these different patterns in a modeling
              effort that will allow projections of different human-activity patterns and
              urban-CO2 distribution.  This work will provide an understanding of how and why
              CO2 levels vary across a city.  It will emphasize the interactions between land
              use, human activities, and meteorological conditions within an urban matrix. 
              It will allow projection of anticipated population expansions on the Arizona
              region.  The project has substantial educational components and clear links
              with the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research Program.
