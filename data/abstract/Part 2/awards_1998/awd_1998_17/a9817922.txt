"Robert Spencer's North Alaskan Eskimo -
              40 Years Later"

Robert F. Spencer's book, The North Alaskan Eskimo - A Study
              in Ecology and Society, set a new standard in arctic ethnography, and it has
              served as the basic reference on North Alaskan Eskimo social organization and
              ecology ever since it first appeared forty years ago.  However, a number of new
              information sources have become available since Spencer wrote the book.  This
              research project analyzes new information to see which of Spencer's general
              conclusions have withstood the passage of time and which need to be modified in
              light of the new evidence.  The main hypothesis guiding the research is that
              almost all of Spencer's major conclusions will be found to be valid for the
              last two decades of the 19th century, but much less so for earlier periods.  
              The hypothesis will be examined in the light of information contained in (1)
              published documents dating from the early and middle parts of the 19th century,
              (2) published documents dating from the 1880s and early 1890s, and (3) the
              unpublished field records of John Simpson, Froelich Rainey, Robert Spencer, and
              Ernest S. Burch, Jr.

Whether the hypothesis is confirmed or not, the study
              will contribute to our understanding of north Alaskan Eskimo social
              organization and ecology and, more generally, of the structure of moderately
              complex hunter-gatherer societies.
