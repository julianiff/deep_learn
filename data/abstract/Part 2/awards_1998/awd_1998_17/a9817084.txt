Abstract    :
              During development, cells acquire a wide variety of shapes that are
>tailored
              to their differentiated functions.  The shape of a plant cell is
>dictated by
              the wall that surrounds it, a complex and highly structured
>matrix of
              carbohydrates, proteins, phenolic compounds, and lipids.  The
>pattern in
              which a wall expands as that cell enlarges depends upon its
>composition and
              structure, which in turn is controlled by the cell within.
>The work described
              in this proposal is aimed at furthering our
>understanding of mechanisms
              governing plant cell morphogenesis.
>	Mutations in three maize genes required
              for leaf epidermal cell
>morphogenesis have been isolated.  In all of these
              "brick" mutants,
>epidermal cells expand to achieve a normal size and overall
              rectangular
>shape, but are completely lacking the marginal lobes
              characteristic of leaf
>blade epidermal cells.  Preliminary studies of brk
              mutant phenotypes have
>led to two alternative hypotheses for Brk gene
              function.  The first is that
>Brk genes promote intracellular asymmetries,
              which direct non-uniform
>patterns of deposition/secretion of wall components,
              producing specialized
>epidermal cell shapes.  The second is that Brk genes
              are required for the
>synthesis of particular wall components needed to
              achieve non-uniform
>patterns of cell expansion.  In the experiments proposed
              under Specific Aim
>1, these hypotheses are explored through further
              characterization of
>intracellular and extracellular events associated with
              the formation of
>epidermal cell lobes, and how these events are altered in
              each of the 3 brk
>mutants.  Specific Aim 2 is to use genetic mosaic analysis
              to determine
>whether each gene functions cell autonomously or
              non-autonomously to
>control cell shape.  To pursue an understanding of Brk
              gene function in
>molecular terms, Specific Aim 3 is to clone one of the Brk
              genes using
>transposon tagging.  Subsequent to cloning one of the Brk genes,
              the amino
>acid sequence of its predicted protein product will be determined
              and
>analyzed for homology to other proteins or protein motifs, and
              the
>expression of this gene will be examined to determine how it relates
              to
>epidermal cell morphogenesis.
