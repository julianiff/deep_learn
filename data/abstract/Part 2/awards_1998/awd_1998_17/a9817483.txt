The Digital Atheneum:  New techniques for restoring, searching, and
              editing humanities collections

This work will develop new digital libraries
              from aging and damaged
portions of the Cottonian Collection at the British
              Library, tailored
to the requirements of scholars in the humanities.
The
              result of this project will be state-of-the-art technical approaches,
tools
              that incorporate those new approaches, and a widely distributed
              digital
library of restored, previously inaccessible manuscripts.
In
              particular, the technical focus will encompass the following
              important
research areas:
  o  Continued development of new illumination
              techniques for damaged and
     aging manuscripts using novel lighting methods
              to make it possible to
     recover markings and information that would
              otherwise be invisible
  o  Creation of a semantic object model and framework
              for creating digital
     collections that will support domain or
              data-specific restoration and
     content-based search/access
  o 
              Incorporation of novel processing techniques for digitally restoring,
    
              enhancing, and searching/annotating manuscripts that have suffered damage
    
              from fire, water, and aging
The project has strong support from IBM through
              the Shared University
Research (SUR).  Likewise, partnership with the British
              Library provides
priviledged access to high-quality collections, manuscript
              and curator
expertise, and digitization facilities.
