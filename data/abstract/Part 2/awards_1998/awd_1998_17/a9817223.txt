In February of 1997 the United States and the Russian
              Federation signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) calling for
              cooperation in the area of high speed computing, applied to problems in
              academic science and engineering research.  This MOU is in the context of the
              Science and Technology (S&T) committee of the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on
              Economics and Technological Cooperation.

Following meetings of the
              Telecommunications Working Group (TCWG) of the S&T committee, it was agreed
              that such cooperation should be between individuals and groups supported by
              their own countries.  In order to identify and establish such cooperation, it
              was further agreed at the TCWG meeting in February of 1998 that a joint
              workshop should be held in Russia to introduce Russian computational scientist
              to their U.S. counterparts.  At this workshop both sides would describe their
              current research and discuss possible collaborative activities.
