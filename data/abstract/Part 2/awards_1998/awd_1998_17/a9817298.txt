Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the development of computer-aided design
              algorithms for optimizing membrane separation flowsheets used for gaseous
              separations.  The approach to be used involves combining simple approximate
              models for the membrane modules in a larger network superstructure, followed by
              the use of mixed-integer nonlinear programming methods(MINLP)to optimize the
              flowsheet structure.  This general approach has been used for solving other
              separation train synthesis problems in the design area, however its application
              to this is new and timely.
