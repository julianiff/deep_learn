This project involves preliminary research by a team of three
              young anthropologists studying how female entrepreneurship is patterned
              according to social and household constraints in Puerto Rico, Martinique and
              Barbados.  These three Caribbean island societies were colonized by Spain,
              France and Britain, respectively.  While exhibiting strong differences in the
              incidence of female self-employment and local gender role patterns, the islands
              share a history of sugar plantation economies and slave labor.  The research is
              designed to identify the specific institutional and ideological factors
              associated with higher frequencies and success rates of female entrepreneurs in
              each island society. The researchers will conduct a household socioeconomic
              census and structured in-depth interviews with male and female household heads
              in each island's central city to gather comparative data to test hypotheses
              about the relation of various gender-based ideological and structural factors
              to women's economic outcomes.  This research is important because it will
              advance our understanding of the social and institutional constraints on
              women's economic success in the developing world. This inexpensive pilot
              project should allow the researchers to refine their procedures and plan a
              major comparative study on this subject.
