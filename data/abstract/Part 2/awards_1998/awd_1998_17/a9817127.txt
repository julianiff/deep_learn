                Peter K. Kilpatrick       Affiliation:                       North Carolina
              State University                             This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program        sub-element of the Interfacial,
              Transport and Separations Program of        the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Peter Kilpatrick at North
              Carolina State        University. The research involves fundamental studies on
              the emulsion        and foam formation characteristics of asphaltenes commonly
              found in        the petroleum industry. Such asphaltene based emulsions are
              made up of        viscoelastic films formed by crosslinking of primary
              aggregates. These        crosslinked flocculates are environmentally
              deleterious as they may        pose health hazards as endocrine disruptors.
              Additionally, they form        waxy dispersions that tend to plug exploration
              and transmission        pipelines. The objective of the work is to elucidate
              the mechanisms of        formation, the stability aspects and rheological
              properties of these        emulsions.  Such fundamental studies will open the
              way to mitigate the        formation of these emulsions.
