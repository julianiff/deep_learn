Lay summary

Proteins are the building blocks of
              cells in animal tissue. Our laboratory has been focusing its research on
              proteins involved in communicating messages from one cell to another in nervous
              tissue, i.e., the receivers/translators of the message. This proposal will
              concentrate on the role of the protein called P2X2 that receives messages from
              the messenger known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  We have recently
              discovered a new form of the protein called P2X2-3. We have determined that
              this new protein has a very unusual structure. Based on this unusual structure,
              we surmise that P2X2-3 may have a special role in cells. This role may be to
              translate a special type of message to the cell when the messenger, ATP, is
              received. Therefore, this proposal will investigate the function of P2X2-3 in
              cells. We will determine how it is functionally different from other related
              proteins. These goals will be accomplished by first studying the proteins by
              placing them into special cells where their function can be defined without any
              other proteins interfering with the study. Then we will determine what cells in
              tissue already make the protein to be studied and we will study the protein in
              these cells. Finally, the results obtained in isolation will be compared to
              results obtained from cells obtained from the tissue. We predict that the
              properties of the proteins in the cells from the tissue will be determined by
              the properties of the proteins observed in isolation. In this manner, we will
              define the role of P2X2-3 in cells. These results will also allow us to predict
              the role of similar proteins in nervous tissue
