	This pilot study develops the design
              and methodology of a larger study to evaluate the impact of ecotourism on
              household livelihood security in Costa Rica and Belize. The goal of this pilot
              project will be to produce a set of valid and reliable research instruments and
              methods to revise and resubmit a proposal for a larger project to test the
              hypothesis that ecotourism involvement improves household livelihood security
              and reduces household vulnerability. The researchers, cultural anthropologists
              from Baylor University and the University of Kansas, will collect
              anthropometric and socio-economic data from households in four community sites,
              two each in Belize and Costa Rica, one of which engaged in ecotourism and the
              other matched as much as possible except for a lack of ecotourism involvement,
              over a period of one summer.  The researchers will train students to accompany
              them in the research, and will also train two field assistants from a host
              country university.  They will gather preliminary data on households and
              communities, and will test the validity and reliability of an index of
              Household livelihood security and vulnerability.  
The research will help
              advance our understanding of the effects of this relatively new form of tourism
              on host communities, as well as further the research careers of two female
              scientists, and help train students in research design and methods.
