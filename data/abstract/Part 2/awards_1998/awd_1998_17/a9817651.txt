Analysis of the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur present in sediments
              and rocks is of fundamental importance for research in a broad spectrum of the
              Earth and Ocean Sciences.  This grant supports one-half of the funds needed for
              the acquisition of a Coulometrics Inorganic Carbon Analyzer and CE Elemental
              Analyzer that will be installed and operated in the Earth Sciences Department
              at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. USC is committed to
              providing the remaining funds required for the purchase.  Specifically, the
              Coulometrics CM 140 will be used for analyzing carbonate percentage in recent
              sediments and rocks and the CE 2500 will be used for analysis of total carbon,
              hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur.  This instrumentation will replace the LECO
              analysis system that has been used in the department since the early 60's,
              providing increased sensitivity, speed of analysis and accuracy. It will also
              provide enhanced capability as it permits measurements of nitrogen and
              hydrogen.  This equipment will facilitate the research programs of ten faculty
              members spanning the fields of sedimentary geology, geochemistry,
              paleoceanography and paleontology.  It will also be of instructional use,
              particularly in graduate classes in carbonate stratigraphy, geochemistry and
              paleoceanography.  Users outside of USC will also be able to negotiate for
              machine time for appropriate research projects.
