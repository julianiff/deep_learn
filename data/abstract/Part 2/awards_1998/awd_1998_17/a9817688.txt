This award will provide partial support for the
              featured speakers and for some graduate students to attend the 1999 Spring
              Topology Conference hosted by the University of Utah with the help of Brigham
              Young University.  This conference, one of a series held annually at different
              institutions around the country, is now in its 33rd year and has established
              itself as perhaps the largest and certainly one of the most successful annual
              topology conferences in the U.S.  Its traditional emphasis has been broadened
              in recent years to include dynamical systems.  Still more recently an emphasis
              on newer topics in geometric topology has been accelerated, and this will most
              definitely again be the case in 1999.  The general format will be plenary
              (semi-expository) talks on the three mornings of the conference, followed in
              the afternoons by 3-4 special sessions consisting of invited one-hour talks and
              shorter contributed talks.  The number of invited featured speakers is 22, and
              the total number of registered speakers is 67, according to the final
              preconference version of the conference website.  The featured talks will be in
              geometric topology, manifold theory, geometric group theory, large scale
              geometry, continuum theory, dynamical systems, and set theoretic topology. 
              Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and by underrepresented
              minorities has been encouraged, the first two with notable success.  In fact,
              four of the featured speakers are women.
