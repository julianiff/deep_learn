Abstract    :
              9817050 Jackson The objective of this research is to minimize waste, waste
              generation and fresh water use in the corn nixtamalization process used in the
              manufacture of  corn products such as corn chips, tortilla chips, tacos and
              corn tortillas.  The traditional process involves cooking and steeping of corn
              in excess water and results in significant loss of corn solids and generation
              of large volumes of alkaline, high organic wastes.  The objective of this
              project is to minimize waste generation and fresh water use by optimizing the
              principal variables, process modeling and developing novel process approaches. 
              The research will be conducted following two paths.  The first approach will be
              to optimize the traditional nixtamalization process, minimizing water use and
              waste generation, using Response Surface Methodology and process modeling to
              optimize the process variables.  The second approach will be to develop a novel
              enzymatic processing technique that uses steam to cook the corn without alkali
              and pericarp degrading cellulolytic enzymes to digest the cooked corn to reduce
              water intensity and corn loss.  This award is made by NSF as part of the joint
              NSF/EPA Program on Technologies for a Sustainable Environment.
