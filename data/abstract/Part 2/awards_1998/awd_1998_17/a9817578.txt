Abstract    :
              9817578
Magnetorheological (MR) materials consist of dispersions of
              micrometer
sized particulates of magnetically soft materials in organic
              liquids. When
an external magnetic field is applied, the polarized magnetic
              particles
form "pearl chains" constituting a fibrillated structure that
              exhibits a
respectable "yield stress"  (~ up to 100 kPa). MR fluids represent
              a
technology enabling and intellectually engaging family of smart,
              field
controllable materials. MR fluids can enable many technologies for
              active
vibration control. Applications include shock absorbers, smart bridges,
              and
dampers for high rise buildings for protection against seismic
              activity.
The goal of the proposed program is to carefully investigate
              the
application relevant, dynamic mechanical properties of MR materials with
              a
view to elucidate the mechanics and also the mechanisms underlying
              MR
materials. We will elucidate the transient stress response of MR fluids
              in
switching magnetic fields. Our collaborations with industry will be
              useful
in transferring our research outcomes to the industry.
