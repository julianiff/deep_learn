PI Name:	Raymond Kesner

The major
              aim of this grant is to study in rats the role of the hippocampus in learning
              and memory by determining which subregions within the hippocampus mediate
              important processes associated with the selection of appropriate spatial and
              temporal information to be remembered (pattern 
separation), the storage
              (consolidation) and retrieval of new patterns to be associated with spatial and
              temporal information as well as short-term representation of new, but ever
              present spatial-temporal contextual information.  New behavioral paradigms were
              developed to determine whether 
in accordance with the assumptions of specific
              computational models, there is any subregional specificity. New neurotoxic
              lesion techniques were developed to ensure that the lesions are specific and
              primarily affect only one subregion.  The knowledge that will be gained from
              this research will provide for a better understanding of how the hippocampus
              processes critical information associated with learning and memory.  Since the
              same behavioral paradigms can also be used to study humans with brain damage to
              the hippocampus, this knowledge can also aid in the development of new
              therapeutic (behavioral and pharmacological) approaches to aid patients with
              damage to the hippocampus, which includes psychomotor epilepsy and Alzheimer's
              patients.
