An integrated experimental and analytical approach is
              established to deveop a 3D model for fracture mechanics in woven composites.
              Experimental techniques are implemented to monitor the in-situ damage/fracture
              evolution process. Computational models include microstructures of the
              materials and the failure process is based on the constitutive level. A series
              of innovative experiments and a three dimensional model advance the
              understanding of the complex fracture mechanisms that influence the design
              methodology of woven composites.***
