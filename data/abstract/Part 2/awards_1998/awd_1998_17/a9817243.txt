Of the hundreds of acoustic cues in the speech signal, some
              are faster and more auditorily salient than others and thus differ in the
              probability of being detected and in their incidence of use in the world's
              languages.  One study in this project tests a hypothesis that salient cues for
              vowels require a short time and can differentiate five or six vowel qualities
              whereas a greater number of vowel distinctions requires additional longer cues.
               Another study investigates whether relatively long duration cues can interact
              when they are present at two sites within a word, those from one site
              effectively camouflaging those from the other.  Another study investigates the
              causes of asymmetries in the misperception of consonants' place of
              articulation, for example, "thin" is confused with "Finn" more often than the
              reverse.  A hypothesis is tested that only auditorily weak cues exhibit such
              perceptual asymmetries.  Another study will employ the internet to conduct
              perception tests in order to engage native speakers of language poorly
              represented in the US.  The results will give linguistics greater understanding
              of sound change and phonological universals and will give psychology, foreign
              language instruction, communication disorders, and speech technology, a better
              understanding of how humans perceive speech.
