A National Gallery of the Spoken Word 

This the first year
              funding of a five year Cooperative Agreement award.  The National Gallery of
              the Spoken Word (NGSW) will preserve and, within the limits of copyright law,
              make historically significant voice recordings freely available and easily
              accessible via the Internet. The NGSW will create a significant, fully
              searchable, online database of spoken word collections that span the 20th
              century.  A collaborative project among the humanities, engineering, education
              and library science, this gallery will provide the first large-scale repository
              of its kind. . Participants in this project include researchers who are
              recognized leaders in the development of aural search capabilities. The NGSW
              will also create a repository of high quality digital versions of key spoken
              material with standard bibliographic and metadata access while developing a set
              of best practices for future development of sound on the web, including methods
              for conversion, preservation, access, and copyright compliance.
