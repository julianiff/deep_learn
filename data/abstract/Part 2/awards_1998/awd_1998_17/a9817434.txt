DLI-Phase 2: A Patient Care Digital Library 

This is the first
              year funding of a five year Cooperative Agreement award.  Healthcare consumers
              and providers both need quick and easy access to a wide range of online
              resources.  The goal of this project is to provide personalized access to a
              distributed patient care digital library through the development of a system,
              PERSIVAL (Personalized Retrieval and Summarization of Image, Video And Language
              resources). PERSIVAL will tailor search, presentation, and summarization of
              online medical literature and consumer health information to the end user,
              whether patient or healthcare provider.  PERSIVAL will utilize the secure
              online patient records available at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC)
              as a sophisticated, pre-existing user model that can aid in predicting user's
              information needs and interests. Key features of the proposed work include
              personalized access to distributed, multimedia resources available both locally
              and over the Internet, fusion of repetitive information and identification of
              conflicting information from multiple relevant sources, and presentation of
              information in concise multimedia summaries that cross-link images, video, and
              text.  When the latest medical information is provided at the point of patient
              care, it can help practicing clinicians to avoid missed diagnoses and minimize
              impending complications.  When expressed in understandable terms, it can
              empower patients to take charge of their healthcare.
