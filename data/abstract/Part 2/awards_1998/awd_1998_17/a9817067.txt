Abstract    :
              This project is to investigate: 1) mechanisms responsible for enzyme thermal and
              acid stability; 2) structural features that control enzyme activity, substrate
              specificity, and cofactor specificity; 3) new xylose isomerases with different
              activities and thermo-acid stabilities; 4) strategies for creating
              thermo-acid-stable enzymes and catalytically improved xylose isomerases for
              high fructose corn syrup production; and 5) knowledge about ther performance of
              immobilized high temperature enzymes.  The interaction between engineering and
              biochemistry students provided by this project is to be an excellent
              preparation for their future participation in the expanding fields of
              bioprocessing and biotechnology.
