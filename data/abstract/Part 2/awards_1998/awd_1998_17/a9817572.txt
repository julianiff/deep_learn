DLI Phase 2: A Distributed Information Filtering System for Digital
              Libraries

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. 
              The proposed research is aimed at designing and developing a distributed
              intelligent information distribution and filtering system that provides
              personalized information services to the user while minimizing direct user
              involvement.  The system is intended to traverse the internet to retrieve the
              most relevant information of interest to the user.  Information filtering will
              be realized using a information agents, and will involve integration of
              advanced concepts and techniques from the domains of artificial intelligence,
              information retrieval, and distributed object computing.  The agents will
              contain models of network-based dynamic information resources and will have the
              capability to learn changing patterns of an individual user's interest.
              

Four key basic research areas to be addressed are:                         
                                                                            methods for
              adapting various knowledge structures associated with an agent 
new and robust
              agent architectures 
agent collaboration protocols based on a natural or
              artificial economic framework 
agent-driven information service operations
