DLI Phase 2: A Digital Library for the
              Humanities

This is the first year funding of a five year continuing award. 
              This project is focussing on  developing the foundations of a scalable,
              broad-based, interdisciplinary digital library for the humanities. The
              principal investigators for this project include not only humanists but also
              specialists in computer-human interface design and in cognitive science.  The
              goals are to both to improve the ways that humanists can perform their
              intellectual work and to design materials that are more accessible to the
              vastly expanded audience already reached by the World Wide Web.  Digital
              libraries allow us to improve traditional teaching and learning; they also
              challenge us to redefine the relationship between the humanities and society as
              a whole. To achieve the goals, new document models must be developed to serve a
              more complex audience and which are designed to interact  at various levels in
              diverse human and electronic contexts; that is, as part of a scalable,
              integrated digital library that can be maintained over time.  Building on
              twelve years of development with the Greco-Roman world, the project team will
              create a digital library that includes a wide range of materials, ranging from
              ancient Egypt through nineteenth century London.
