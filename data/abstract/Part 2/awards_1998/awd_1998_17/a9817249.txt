Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to increase the efficiency of cell culture
              systems by; (a) genetic manipulation of the cells; and (b) utilization of a
              cell retention system.  Genetic manipulation utilizing an AML promoter specific
              to the G1-phase adds to the benefits of increasing the specific production rate
              at lower growth rates.  Under these conditions, cells can be cultured at low
              media exchange rates and a higher titer can be achieved.  
Utilization of a
              cell retention system increases the cell density and allows a higher volumetric
              productivity.  The CHO expression system considered in this proposal is
              extensively used in industry and the results from this research will be very
              applicable to industrial manufacturing.
