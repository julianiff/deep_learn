The International Federation of Medical and Biological
              Engineering (IFMBE) has the aims of encouraging research and the application of
              knowledge, the dissemination of information, and the promotion of collaboration
              between engineers, scientists and educators within the medical and biological
              engineering community.  The IFMBE Administrative Council meets twice each year
              to oversee the management of the IFMBE and entail strategic planning of the
              organization, planning of scientific meetings, publications, dissemination of
              scientific information, and initiation of advanced projects in critical and
              emerging areas.

This project provides partial support for the United States
              representation to the Administrative Council of the IFMBE to attend its
              meetings over a period of three years in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. 
              United States representation to the Administrative Council of the IFMBE is
              under the aegis of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
              Engineering (AIMBE).  Representation on the Council provides the United States
              with the opportunity to develop new lines of communications and collaborative
              projects among biomedical engineering researchers from many countries, thereby 
              extending our leadership role in medical technology research and development.
              Information about Council deliberations is to be disseminated by AIMBE to a
              wide audience through articles in various technical publications, specialized
              workshops and seminars, and electronically on the Internet.
