The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) proposes an
              Institutional Minority Graduate Education
Program to increase the productivity
              of its PhD Programs in Biology, Chemistry, Chemical-
Physics, Marine Sciences
              and Civil Engineering in conferring PhDs to minorities.  Building on
the
              existing pipeline strategy that spans from K-1 2 to graduate research developed
              with
NSF support, UPR- IMGEP will increase annual degrees conferred from 13 to
              26 by the year
2003 and increase enrollment of minority students from the
              mainland to 30%.  The main
strategy is a continuum of support for transition
              into and completion of Ph.D. studies,
beginning with recruitment strategies of
              undergraduate students in research, and support
during their first year
              through a bridging seminar and peer mentors.  To increase candidates
for
              academic careers and future role models for minority students, a Teaching
              Assistantship
Training Program will be created.  In their second and third
              year, students will participate in
the Increasing Scholarly Productivity
              Program to support the elaboration of dissertations,
scientific publications
              and presentations, grantsmanship skills and time management skills.
Two year
              fellowships will be provided to attract students into critical areas of
              shortage and
into academic careers.  The UPR Vice Presidency and Academic
              Deans for SMET will lead
the strategic planning and institutionalization of
              the program.  The UPR will cost share
$1.25 million.
