DLI Phase 2: Informedia-II: Integrated Video Information
              Extraction and Synthesis for Adaptive Presentation and Summarization from
              Distributed Libraries

The Informedia-II Project continues the pursuit of
              search and discovery in the video medium.  This phase will transform the
              paradigm for accessing digital video libraries through meaningful, manipulable
              overviews of video document sets, multimodal queries, and adaptive
              summarizations of very large amounts of video from heterogeneous distributed
              sources. Video information collages are the key technology in Informedia-II and
              will be built by advancing information visualization research to effectively
              deal
with multiple video documents.  A video information collage is a
              presentation of text, images, audio, and video derived from multiple video
              sources in order to summarize, provide context, and communicate aspects of the
              content for the originating set of sources.  The collages to be investigated
              include chrono-collages emphasizing time, geo-collages emphasizing spatial
              relationships, and auto-documentaries which preserve
video's temporal nature. 
              Users will be able to interact with the video collages to generate multimodal
              queries across time, space, and sources.

Together with external partners,
              the project will also create an accessible, lasting digital video archive of
              historical, political and scientific relevance. Vast collections of video and
              audio recordings have captured the events of the last century, yet these remain
              a largely untapped resource of historical and scientific value.
