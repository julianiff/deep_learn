Abstract    :
                EEC-9872851  ROESSET    This award to the National Science Foundation
              Engineering Research Center entitled "Offshore Technology Research Center
              (OTRC)" at Texas A&M University/University of Texas is to enhance the current
              generation capability in its unique wave model basin facility.  The OTRC will
              upgrade their wave basin current generation capability through an increase in
              flow capacity by installing larger capacity pumps and motors as well as
              additional manifolds.  Upgrading the current generation capability will enable
              the OTRC to research structural designs for deepwater applications that are
              subject to surface and deep currents - affecting hull motions and forces on
              tethers, risers, and mooring lines.  The proposed increase in flow capacity
              will enable the OTRC to produce more homogeneous currents over an extended
              volume with better control of the variation with depth, thus providing a better
              representation of the environmental actions on deep water.  With the new
              equipment installed, the wave basin will continue to be used for both research
              and educational projects.
