This proposal requests support for 10-15 US participants,
              particularly graduate students and postdocs, in the NATO Advanced Study
              Institute "Symmetries and Integrability of Difference Equations" to be hosted
              by the University of Montreal, July 26 - August 6, 1999.  The purpose of the
              Institute is to review the principle developments that have occurred in this
              area in recent years, particularly in the quantum domain.  Integrable systems
              have long played a crucial role in mathematical physics.  Standard examples
              include central force motion, harmonic oscillators, and systems with a high
              degree of symmetry, have been greatly enhanced in the past thirty years, and
              now include interacting many body systems, coupled spin chains, and integrable
              systems with an infinity of degrees of freedom.  The main results leading to
              current work in the subject will be presented in a coherent form that will be
              accessible to graduate students and young investigators.
