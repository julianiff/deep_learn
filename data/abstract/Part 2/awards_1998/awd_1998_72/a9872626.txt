Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9872626       EICKEN, HAJO  UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA    The project
              will quantify the lateral and vertical meltwater movement and associated
              freshwater and heat fluxes in summer sea ice through the use of novel
              hydrological tracers. The fate of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is a very
              important issue due to its effects on global and regional climate and
              economics.  The investigator will use stable isotopes and fluorescent dyes to
              make a significant advance in the understanding of the driving forces
              responsible for melting sea ice.  As such, the research will enable
              improvements in sea ice models that will allow better prediction of melting in
              response to global warming. The project will be conducted at the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean site in the Beaufort Sea where other studies
              underway will enhance the results of this project by providing validation of
              the techniques employed.
