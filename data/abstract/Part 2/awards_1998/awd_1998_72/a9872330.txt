Abstract    :
              A number of fundamental issues related to the durability of piezoceramic
              actuators will be studies, specifically concerning crack growth mechanisms in
              these materials and the implications of domain wall (polarization) switching at
              the crack tip. A combined materials science-continuum mechanics approach will
              be used in both experimental and theoretical studies. The five areas to be
              explored are the intrinsic toughness of these materials, analysis of Vickers
              indentation cracks, effects of temperature and load frequency on domain
              switching, fatigue crack growth mechanisms, and the effect of crack surface
              boundary conditions on the near-tip stress and electric fields. Special
              attention will be paid to the characteristics of domain wall switching under
              long term cyclic mechanical and electrical loading.
