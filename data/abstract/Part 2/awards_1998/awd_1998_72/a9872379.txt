Abstract    :
              The objective of the project are as follows: To develop an accelerated testing
              procedure to study the interaction between environmental and mechanical
              loadings; To develop a theoretical model for predicting the long term
              performance of concrete under hygrothermo-chemo-mechanical coupling; and to
              develop a novel method for reliability-based evaluation of deteriorating
              concrete.  The results of the proposed project will be very useful for
              evaluation and rehabilitation of various types of concrete infrastructures such
              as concrete pavements,  bridge decks, bridge piers, concrte dams and offshore
              platforms.  The research team consists of three institutions: the University of
              Colorado at Boulder, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the Colorado 
              Department of Transportation.
