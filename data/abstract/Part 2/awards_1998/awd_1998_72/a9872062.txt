Abstract    :
              This award supports research into the definition and development of a pattern
              language and pattern book for multi-agent systems, and the development of
              formal social structures and generalized social software artifacts for
              agent-based systems.  The artifacts implementing the social structures are
              software-embodied entities existing separately from the intelligent agents that
              interact with them.  Coordination and control tasks are divided between agents
              and the social artifacts with which they interact. This division of labor
              allows the use of coordination mechanisms designed to control the combinatorial
              explosions of coordination costs that are expected in systems with large
              numbers of agents. It also enables explicit control of emergent social behavior
              in agent-based systems.  The pattern language will improve expertise transfer
              between developers and researchers in intelligent agent systems, and the social
              structures and artifacts will allow creation of coordination algorithms
              scalable to systems with large numbers of agents. http://www.eas.asu.edu/~gcss/
