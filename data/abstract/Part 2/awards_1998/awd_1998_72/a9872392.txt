Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this CRCD program at the University of Missouri-Rolla,
              entitled "Multidisciplinary Research and Modular Courseware Development in
              Infrastructural Health Monitoring Systems", to integrate the research results
              with curriculum development in the multidisciplinary area of structural health
              monitoring systems for the benefit of students in civil, electrical, nuclear,
              mechanical and aerospace engineering departments.  The overall goals of the
              proposed project are:

* Development of multidisciplinary modular courseware
              for two-course sequence in health monitoring systems.
* Collaborative,
              project-based learning with hands-on laboratory experiments in an
              interdisciplinary atmosphere.
* Development of multimedia-based innovative
              educational delivery systems.
* Provide a unique opportunity for minority
              students and faculty from the Turabo University, Puerto Rico, to conduct joint
              course development in health monitoring systems.
* Collaborate with government
              laboratories and industrial organizations for finalization of course contents,
              delivery of guest lectures and technology transfer.
