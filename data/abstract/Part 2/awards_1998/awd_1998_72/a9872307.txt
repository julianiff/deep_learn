Abstract    :
              98-72307  Azadivar    Kansas State  An Engineering Learning Center:  A Model for
              Systemic Engineering Education Reform    This project will expand the current
              domain of a Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC), developed with partial support
              from NSF (three engineering programs) into an Engineering Learning Center (ELC)
              to include other areas of engineering as well as some business disciplines. 
              Six faculty members representing five engineering and three business school
              programs will participate in this project as the core decision making body for
              the ELC  and as advisors to students from their corresponding disciplines.  In
              addition, because interns' experiences require much written and oral
              communication, a professor from KSU's English Department, with extensive
              experience in technical writing and professional communications, will
              participate as consultant assisting students with their communication tasks. 
              Furthermore, the project will extend the internship opportunities to high
              school students in an effort to prepare them for engineering education even
              before they have entered the university.    This project addresses many of the
              goals of the Action Agenda.  In particular, experience has shown, that by
              supplementing their classroom education with an internship at the MLC, students
              gain the ability to lead and perform as a member of a team, understand the
              non-technical aspects of engineering decisions, develop strong communication
              and persuasion skills, and acquire skills for life long learning.  In addition,
              while presenting all the benefits, the proposed system does not add to the
              length of engineering education.  At the completion of this project, the PI
              will document a fully implementable system that could be used as a model for
              engineering at many universities.
