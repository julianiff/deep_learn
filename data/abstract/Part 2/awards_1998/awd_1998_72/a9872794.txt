Abstract    :
              9872794  Hauser    This award is to provide funds to the Engineering Research
              Center on Advanced Electronic Materials Processing at North Carolina State
              University to purchase two single wafer processing modules for use in
              developing next generation integrated circuit fabrication approaches.  The
              requested equipment will enhance the metal on silicon gate stack research
              cluster at the Center and enable the use of silicon wafers 200 millimeters in
              diameter, which will provide the capability to transfer the results of the
              research directly to the semiconductor industry.  The two modules are remote
              plasma processor and an in situ analysis chamber respectively.
