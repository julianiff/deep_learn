Abstract    :
              This project addresses the durability of adhesive bonds against failure due to
              fatigue in the ultra-long life region of over 10 million cycles. An accelerated
              testing method will be used based on piezoelectric ceramic actuators which can 
              supply large strain/stress actuation at frequencies up to 50,000 Hz.
              Complications such as heat generation due to the rapid cycling and frequency
              dependent failure behavior will be examined experimentally and theoretically.
              Fatigue damage mechanisms and damage evolution processes in the adhesive joints
              under different mechanical loading and environmental conditions will be
              systematically investigated. Micro-mechanial models of damage mechanisms will
              be developed and integrated with continuum mechanics calculations to predict
              the structural durability of adhesive joints under cyclic loading.
