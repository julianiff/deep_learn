Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to provide the knowledge base to improve the
              capability of emergency response organizations to improvise.  The need for
              support in improvisation in the form of training and real-time decision aids is
              well recognized.  The theoretical bases for this project will be a decision
              logic which models cognitive processes in improvisation as evinced, for
              example, in documented cases of emergency response.  In the first of three
              experiments, the efficancy of the decision logic will be assessed with respect
              to its ability to support decision makers in fashioning improvisations which
              are relevant to a task in real-time provlem solving.  For the final
              experiments, the logic will be embedded in a decision support system and tested
              in two separate gaming situations, one in Eurpoe and one in the United States. 
              The principal contributions of this research will be in providing (1)
              guidelines as embodied in training materials and a decision aid for preparing
              emergency managers in improvise, and (2) a decision support system for the
              processof improvisation in emergency response.
