Vemuri
This U.S.-Mexico award will support a planning visit by Dr. V.
              R. Vemuri of the University of California, Davis to work with Professor
              Guillermo Hernandez of Universidad del Mayab in Mexico.  The investigators are
              requesting travel and videoconferencing support to plan a collaborative
              research program between their two universities in the application of
              telecommunication technology for remote collaboration in the area of materials
              science.

The proposed collaborative project will explore the potential of
              Internet and Web-based technologies to address problems involving multi-lingual
              and multi-cultural users. Problems to be studied involve heavy use of neural
              networks and genetic algorithms. The researchers plan to use existing
              education/teleconferencing facilities at their universities to institute an
              on-going exchange of ideas in areas of mutual interest and promote the exchange
              of graduate students and faculty in a collaborative work environment.
