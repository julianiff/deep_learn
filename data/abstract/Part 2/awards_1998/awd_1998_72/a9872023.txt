Abstract    :
                RE: DMS-9872023

The Department of Mathematics at the University of Florida
              will purchase
computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in
the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used to support
              research 
on:
1) partial differential equations based methods of de-noising,
              segmenting,       
   registration, and deformation of images; 
2)
              reconstructing positron emission tomography images by new analytic and
  
              statistical methods; and
3) automatic detection of land mines from remotely
              sensed data by using 
   spatial scan statistics.  
These projects all
              involve the analysis of large data sets, extensive
numerical calculations, and
              the manipulation and visualization  of both 
two and three dimensional images.
              
The equipment consists of PCs with large memory (RAM) for the
              calculations,
large monitors for visualization, and graphics accelerator cards
              to handle
the large images that are involved.
