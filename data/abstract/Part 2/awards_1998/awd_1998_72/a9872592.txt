              ABSTRACT
EEC-9872592
Keer/NW   

This is an Exploratory Research Project to
              augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center 
for Engineering
              Tribology.

This joint project involves a study of the fundamental issues
              associated with chemical mechanical polishing.  In particular, the research
              will develop fundamental relationships between a 'soft' and a 'hard' surface in
              the presence of fluids trapped at the interface.  To be studied are asperity
              size, mechanical properties and geometric placement, and the influence of
              multiple pad liners structures on polishing characteristics.  The research
              should lead to new strategies for polishing and for the development of
              polishing machines.
