Abstract    :
              The Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications (IMA) with the School
of
              Mathematics at the University of Minnesota will purchase server
upgrade and
              desktop workstations that will be dedicated to the support of
research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used to
support IMA annual
              programs in the areas of Mathematics in Biology
(1998-99), Reactive Flow and
              Transport Phenomena (1999-2000) and
Mathematics in Multi-Media (2000-2001). 
              The IMA and the School of Math
will share two DEC Alpha based workstations
              which will significantly
increase the amount of numerical computational
              capacity available to both
institutions. Desktop workstations purchased will
              provide visualization
and computation resources on an individualized basis for
              IMA long-term
visitors and will also be able to serve as a distributed
              processing cluster
when not dedicated to individual use.
