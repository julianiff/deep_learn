The goal of this project, which was developed in response to
              the Durability Initiative, NSF 98-42, is to formulate and validate a model
              which can use results from accelerated tests to improve the performance of
              cathodic protection systems for concrete structures.  Existing data and the
              current understanding of the following processes will be incorporated within a
              comprehensive three-dimensional model: (i) the electrochemical kinetics of iron
              oxidation, oxygen reduction, and water reduction at the concrete-rebar
              interface;  (ii) the electrochemical kinetics of zinc anode oxidation and
              subsequent reactions of Zn(II) at the concrete-zinc interface;  (iii) the
              transport of water and oxygen through concrete; and (iv) the transport of ions,
              particularly chloride, through concrete.  The model will be validated in
              laboratory tests and then used to investigate strategies for controlling
              cathodic protection systems for optimal performance, for avoidance of buildup
              of electrical resistance at the anode-concrete interface, and for
              electrochemical migration of chlorides away from the rebar.  The model will
              finally be field-tested in suitable real structures.
