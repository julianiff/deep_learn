Abstract    :
                Over the last 30 years, the connection between bacteria and phytoplankton at a
              whole population level has been evaluated. Recent advances in the analysis of
              nucleic acids in natural samples has demonstrated microbial diversity is
              greater than had previously been thought; however, elucidating the linkages
              between bacterial and phytoplankton diversity has not yet been attempted
              despite a great deal of evidence these populations are tightly coupled. Dr.
              Kerkhof will identify specific bacteria and phytoplankton co stimulated during
              upwelling in the coastal ocean.  He will build on preliminary evidence
              demonstrating a linkage between bacteria and phytoplankton during an upwelling
              event off New Jersey in 1995.   Dr. Kerkhof will use molecular tools
              coordinated with a state of the art observational network and shipboard
              sampling to further elucidate these connections between bacteria and
              phytoplankton during four upwelling events (1 4 weeks) in the Mid Atlantic
              Bight (MAB). The research will provide an unprecedented picture of microbial
              community processes, diversity, and dynamics during episodic events in the
              coastal ocean. Ultimately, this understanding of microbial processes in the MAB
              will aid in developing a predictive capability for the near shore coastal ocean
              to forecast regional and global biogeochemical cycling.
