The Department of Statistics at the
              University of Connecticut proposes to purchase one networked HP PC server with
              ten Pentium II PC Workstations, which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in mathematical statistics, complex statistical modeling and
              statistical software development.  In particular, the network will support the
              work of D.K. Dey in Bayesian modeling, A.E. Gelfand in Bayesian computation and
              spatial statistics, J. Glaz in high dimensional scan statistics, L. Kuo in
              Bayesian computation and design  in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, and R.A.
              Vitale in geometry of Gaussian processes.
