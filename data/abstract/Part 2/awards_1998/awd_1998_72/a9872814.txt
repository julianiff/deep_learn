The investigators will conduct two extended measurement
              campaigns involving meteor and medium frequency radars, a CCD spectrograph, and
              a lidar.  The objective is to study systematic biases in horizontal wind
              measurements between the 30 and 40 MHz all-sky meteor radars, and the medium
              frequency radar at Platteville Atmospheric Observatory, and a sodium lidar
              located at Colorado State University.  Also, by making coincident measurements,
              the investigators will validate a new technique for determining mesopause
              temperatures using meteor radar data.  The instruments will be operated for as
              many nights as possible during two months, one in summer and one in winter. 
              The comparison will be conducted using statistical techniques to provide an
              objective, quantitative determination of any systematic biases that exist in
              neutral wind and temperature measurements from the various techniques. The
              results will contribute to the CEDAR/TIMED program. CEDAR, which stands for
              Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change
              program that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to
              study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere,
              Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to
              study similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to
              coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better
              understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.
