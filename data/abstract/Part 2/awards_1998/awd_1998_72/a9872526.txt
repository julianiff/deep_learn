Abstract    :
              The goal of this CRCD project at the University of Florida, entitled, "A
              Net-Centric Undergraduate Course in Adaptive Systems," is to innovate the
              engineering undergraduate curriculum by developing a net-centric, WEB based
              upper division elective on Adaptive Systems.  The ultimate goal is to establish
              a resource center for Adaptive Systems undergraduate instruction at the
              University of Florida which will integrate collaborations from experts
              worldwide and will deliver the course locally and distribute it across the WEB
              to learners at other Universities and in Industry.  The software tools and the
              teaching methodologies developed during this project will be widely applicable
              to other technological courses, so they transcend the specific area of Adaptive
              Systems.
