Abstract    :
              The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics
of Northwestern
              University propose to purchase a Hewlett Packard
multiprocessor graphics
              workstation and two X-terminal stations. The
equipment will be used for
              scientific computation for the following 
research projects:

* Numerical
              simulation of viscous sintering
* Numerical studies of frequency conversion
              and light propagation
    in optical systems
* Complex Structures in
              Pattern-Forming Systems
* Superlattice wave patterns

The principal
              investigator is D. Chopp. Co-principal investigators are 
G. G. Luther, H.
              Riecke, and M. Silber.  Northwestern University has 
agreed to contribute 50%
              of the cost of the equipment.
