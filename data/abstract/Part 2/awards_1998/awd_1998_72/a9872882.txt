Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    EEC-9872882  Ratner    This equipment award is for the
              acquisition and assembly of an Optical Microscopy, Imaging and Image Analysis
              Shared Resource for the ERC for Engineered Biomaterials at the University of
              Washington. This system will provide for comprehensive modern optical
              microscopy techniques, digital image acquisition and powerful image analysis
              geared for the study of cells on biomaterial surfaces. The resource is
              critically needed to facilitate student instruction and training in the use of
              important modern scientific tools.
