The goal of this project is to develop accelerated testing
              methods for cyclic oxidation tests of alumina based oxide coatings and thermal
              barrier coatings of interest to the gas engine industry.  Emphasis will be on a
              study of the fundamental mechanisms which control oxide adhesion by imaging
              oxide and interface structures, developing mechanics models of interface
              decohesion, and by measuring stress and toughness of coating systems as
              functions of high temperature exposure.  The project will involve materials
              students at the University of Pittsburgh and mechanics students at Carnegie
              Mellon University in a joint effort on oxidation mechanisms and the mechanics
              of thin films.
