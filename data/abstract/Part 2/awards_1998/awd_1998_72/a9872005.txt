Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the
Colorado School of
              Mines will purchase computer equipment which
will be dedicated to the support
              of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for
              several research projects,
including in particular: heterogeneity in genetic
              mapping data, numerical
solution of Lyapunov exponents, spin systems, and
              phase transitions,
development of symbolic software for nonlinear partial
              differential 
equations and differential-difference equations, orthogonal
              spline 
collocation, and spherical spectrum estimates.
