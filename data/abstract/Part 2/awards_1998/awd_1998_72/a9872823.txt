              The MIE is the centerpiece of the research program and strategic plan of the
              IMSC, and provides a physical hardware and software framework for the
              integration of multimedia engineering and scientific developments from IMSC and
              elsewhere, with broad multidisciplinary applicability to every aspect of the
              human sensory experience and interpersonal interactions.  Special purpose
              equipment will be purchased to enable the continued evolution of the MIE
              concept.
