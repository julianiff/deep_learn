The principal objective of this project is to develop and
              carry out x-ray scattering experiments that will improve our knowledge of the
              fundamental properties of the liquid surface and/or which will make use of the
              liquid surface to model fundamental two dimensional statistical phenomena.  Two
              examples of phenomena to be studied include:  (i) The relation between the
              thermodynamic properties of fluid phases of two dimensional Langmuir monolayers
              and the short range 2D positional order and (ii) The interfacial compositional
              structure along the surface normal of wetting layers of complex systems, such
              as binary liquids and polymer brushes.

Until recently there were few
              experimental methods capable of obtaining fundamental knowledge regarding the
              microscopic surface structure of liquids.  Possible impact of information
              obtained through this project would be improved procedures for development of
              liquid based technologies such as lubrication, paints, biomedical, etc.  This
              project will also educate a new generation of x-ray scattering scientists.
