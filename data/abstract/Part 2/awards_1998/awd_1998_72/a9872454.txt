Abstract    :
              This CRCD project supports the development at the University of Washington of an
              exportable package for the capstone design course emphasizing computing
              appliences, creates two new undergraduate courses on embedded systems
              programming, creates a new graduate course on the elements of computing
              appliances, and brings the results of research in embedded system design and
              design automation as well as internetworking protocols to the undergraduate
              curriculum.  The exportable package for the capstone course consists of course
              modules and web-based materials that can be augmented and updated by the
              community and used to rapidly set up new project courses, labs, and individual
              senior projects.  The two courses on embedded systems programming include
              material on device drivers, real-time programming and operating systems,
              component-based programming models and also material in the area of wireless
              networking.  Overall, the project is planned to modernize the computer
              engineering curriculum by focusing on a class of devices, services, and
              applications that are expected soon to be center-pieces of the consumer
              electronics and computing industries.
