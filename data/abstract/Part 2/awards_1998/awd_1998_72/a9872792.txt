This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative
              research project between Drs. R. William McCallum, Iowa State University (ISU),
              and Luis Fabietti, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina.  The focus of
              the research will be on the processing and characterization of
              exchanged-enhanced NdFeB-based permanent magnets.  These magnets are of
              fundamental interest because they are made out of composites with high remnant
              magnetization and moderate coercivity.  Yet, their application has been
              hindered by metallurgical obstacles in their processing.  The collaborators
              propose to study the effect of nucleation temperature, undercooling and
              recalescence  on the formation of  microstructures, with the aim of developing
              effective processing routes.  

The development of improved permanent magnet
              materials is a topic of major interest to the materials community, and is also
              of strong interest in regards to the large economic potential of high
              performance permanent magnet materials.  The team of researchers brings
              together an excellent combination of skills and experience, as well as of
              facilities.  The Ames Laboratory  in ISU will enable microstructural
              characterization not available in Argentina, while the US side will gain access
              to twin roller melt spinning apparatus  in Argentina, thus enabling the
              collaborators to expand the range of materials that can be investigated. .
