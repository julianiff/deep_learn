The objective of this International
              Travel Grant is to support a U.S. 
delegation of researchers in geotechnical
              engineering to the Biot 
Conference on Poromechanics, to be held at the
              Universite Catholique de 
Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, 14-16 September
              1998.

The conference will serve as an international forum to exchange
              information 
and experience on deformable porous materials, with applications
              in 
geomechanics, material sciences, geophysics, acoustics and biomechanics.
              
Related topics include: thermodynamics and constitutive modeling, coupled
              
diffusion-deformation processes, wave propagation and dynamics. Topics of
              
particular interest to the US delegation include consolidation and
              
subsidence processes, poroplasticity and poroviscoelasticity, partially
              
saturated porous materials, micro-macro relations and homogenization
              
procedures, fractured porous media, thermo-hygro-chemo-mechanical
              
couplings. Experimental, numerical and theoretical contributions are
              
equally welcome.

The U.S. delegation will benefit by being able to
              interact with researchers 
from other disciplines and from around the world,
              who are working on 
similar issues. At the conclusion of the meeting, the U.S.
              delegation will 
develop a recommended course of action for future research in
              particulate 
mechanics as it applies to geotechnical earthquake engineering:
              this will 
be widely distributed via the Internet to US researchers in the
              field.
