Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania will
purchase a
              four-processor computer and appropriate auxiliary
hardware/software that will
              be dedicated to intensive numerical and
symbolic computations in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment
will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular:

a) The work of Mary Pugh to investigate
              both surface tension effects
in interfacial flows, and some problems in
              computational neuroscience.

b) The work of Charles Epstein on CR structures
              and contact geometry.

c) The work of Ted Chinburg, Fan Chung Graham, and Ron
              Donagi to
investigate problems in algebra and combinatorics.

d) The work on
              Christopher Croke, Dennis DeTurck, Herman Gluck, and
Wolfgang Ziller using
              computers to study a variety of questions in
Riemannian geometry.

Carrying
              out these projects will also involve a number of graduate
students.  We view
              their experience with these computer projects as a
vital part of research and
              of their education as research
mathematicians
