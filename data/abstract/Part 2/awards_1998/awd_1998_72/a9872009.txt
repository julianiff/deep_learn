Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:
The Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice
              University will purchase an eight processor  distributed shared memory SGI
              Origin2000 DS and an SGI O2  Workstation which will be dedicated to the support
              of research  in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
              several research projects, including in particular: Optimization of Linked
              Subsystems Governed by Partial Differential  Equations (Matthias
              Heinkenschloss), Advanced Numerical Methods  for Computation of Thermodynamics
              of Microstructures in Solids (Petr Kloucek), Research on Global Least-Squares
              Data-Fitting  Algorithms with Applications to Computational Biology (Yin
              Zhang). These projects involve computationally intensive, large scale numerical
              simulations and optimization of processes and systems in materials,  biology,
              and engineering.
