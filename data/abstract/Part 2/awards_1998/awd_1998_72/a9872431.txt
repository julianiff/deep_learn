Abstract    :
              The goal of this CRCD program at Michigan State University entitled,
              "Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Curriculum," is to develop and implement a
              multidisciplinary curriculum to train senior undergraduate and graduate
              students in engineering and biological sciences to work effectively in
              multidisciplinary teams on biotechnology-related projects.  A major innovation
              of the curriculum is the development of a Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing
              Laboratory (MBL) course.  This course will teach students advanced research
              methods related to bioprocessing, train them to work effectively in
              multidisciplinary teams, and then provide an intensive laboratory experience
              requiring work in multidisciplinary teams.  Results of the program will include
              the new MBL course and bioprocessing curriculum, assessment and implementation
              results, laboratory manuals for the MBL course, and multidisciplinary-team
              training manuals.
