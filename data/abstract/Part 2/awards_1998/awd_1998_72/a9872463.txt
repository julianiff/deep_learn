Abstract    :
              The main goal of this CRCD proposal to Clarkson University, entitled,
              "Development and Assessment of Hypermedia-Based Instruction in Colloidal
              Technology," is the development, assessment, and dissemination of a series of
              CD-ROM based and Web-based modules containing educational hypermedia courseware
              demonstrating these principles.  This courseware will be organized around a
              central outline describing the necessary fundamental principles, but will also
              include several modules describing in detail applications of colloidal
              phenomena, including heterogeneous catalyst manufacture and usage, chemical
              mechanical polishing, and light scattering probes of colloid structure.  These
              application modules will all be connected by phyerlinks to the relevant
              material in the central outline, although all software will be contained on one
              CD-ROM or one Web site.  Thus this courseware can either be used as
              supplementary material for a full course on colloidal technology, or individual
              modules can be used for courses where only certain aspects or certain
              applications are relevant.  The courseware will allow nonlinear navigation
              through illustrative material which includes hypertext, hyperlinks graphics,
              animations, audio and interactive problems.
