The objective of this research is to explore the
              applicability of biologically-based muscular control to the implementation of
              artificial systems.  This goal will be pursued through the development of a
              cross-bridge-level model of muscle, implemented using analog very large-scale
              integrated (aVLSI) circuits.  The three specific aims of the research are to: 
              (1) develop an aVLSI model of sarcomeres, the fundamental functional components
              of muscle, based upon the Huxley and Zahalak formulations of crossbridge
              dynamics, (2) aggregate these model sarcomeres to create muscle fibers and
              muscle units, and evaluate the role of series/paralled architecture and
              parameter heterogeneity of emergent functionality, and (3) combine model muscle
              units (incorporating activation dynamics) and motoneurons to form motor units,
              and create a computer controlled muscular control system consisting of an array
              of these motor units.
