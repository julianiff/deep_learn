Abstract    :
              In agent-based systems, agents can team in different combinations to
              cooperatively solve problems. Teaming, however, requires that agents understand
              each other and commit to concerted actions. In open, evolving networked
              systems, universal understanding and commitment are unlikely; instead, agents
              should congregate with those agents that they can understand and with whom they
              have successfully teamed in the past.  Agent congregations are defined by
              commitments to common semantics and ontologies (conceptualizations of the
              world). Congregating improves the efficiency of communication and the
              likelihood of successful teaming.  It can, however, impede the formation of
              effective teams whose members cross congregations, because agents need to learn
              new ontologies and incur overhead in searching for new congregations that meet
              their preferences.  This project investigates how agent congregations are
              formed and how and when they should be reformed. The research includes
              simulations of large communities of agents, formal models of agency, and
              prototype systems. Its results will help guide the development of a national
              computing and communication infrastructure that supports the evolving
              identities and interests of scientific, educational, and commercial
              communities, and encourages communication between different communities.
