Abstract    :
              Locialized corrosion of materials often leads to the failure of industrial,
              civil, and military infrastructure well before the designed lifetime.  the rate
              that a small corrosion pit penetrates a material is dictated by the chemistry
              of the materia and its interactions with the environment via convective,
              diffusive, and ohmic transport processes.  The proposed research addresses the
              issue of predicting corrosion put growth rates by combining fundamental studies
              of corrosion chemistry, transport and reaction modeling, and sensor
              development.  Nickel, copper, and aluminum will be used as test beds for the
              proposed approach.  The corrosion of these materials will occur in an acoustic
              streaming flow, which serves as a realistic surrogate  for the flow found in
              microscopic corrosion pits.  Line imaging Raman spectroscopy and
              electrochemical methods will be used to identify and quantify reactive species
              that form at the corroding surface and within the electrolyte near the surface.
               Modeling will combine the chemical kinetic information obtained in the
              corrosion chemistry studies with convective/diffusive transport theory to
              predict corrosion rates in the various materials.  Finally, the characteristics
              of acoustic streaming flows and cyclic voltammetry will be used to develop a
              technique for rapidly assessing the propensity of any material to aggressively
              pitting in the presence of agitation.
