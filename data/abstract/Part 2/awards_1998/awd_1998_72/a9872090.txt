Abstract    :
              The very essence of a hydrothermal system is transfer of heat by a convecting
              fluid.  Despite this central role played by heat transfer, there exists a
              woefully poor knowledge of the flux of heat from seafloor hydrothermal systems
              and its variation through time.  For the well-studied Main Endeavour Field
              (MEF) on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, existing estimates vary widely (from -100 to
              -10000 MW) and have large uncertainties (often spanning an order of magnitude).
               The Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) will be equipped with sensors to measure
              the velocity, temperature and salinity of rising hydrothermal plumes.  Data
              from a series of ABE dives will provide precise, replicate measurements of the
              heat flux, achieving uncertainty better than 20%.  These dives will be
              complemented with a program of hydrographic work conducted at comparable
              spatial scales.
