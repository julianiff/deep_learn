Abstract    :
              This CRCD project supports a broad group of investigators to introduce
              randomization as an algorithm design technique into new and existing courses at
              the University of Florida.  Randomization uses random choices in the execution
              of an algorithm; there are many examples in which it is known to give
              algorithms that are faster than other methods as well as simpler to implement. 
              This project will develop two new courses on Radnomization in Computing and on
              Data Mining and Warehousing as well as introduce randomization techniques into
              about 10 other courses.  The project team has extensive plans for planning
              educational objectives and measuring their success.  A WWW site will be
              established for disseminating materials and results.
