This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research on
              insect immunity and resistance to parasites between Anthony Nappi of Loyola
              University and Norman Ratcliffe of the University of Wales.  The objective of
              their research is to elucidate the nature of the cytotoxic components generated
              by insects that specifically target and destroy their endoparasites.  The
              research will establish whether immune responses in insects involve the
              enhanced production of such cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) as
              superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and nitric oxide.  The
              production of these ROS molecules will be monitored in insect host-parasite
              systems:  Drosophila melanogaster and the parasite the cnynipid wasp,
              Leptopilina boulardi, and Rhodnius prolixus and its parasite, the protozoan
              Trypanosoma rangeli.

The US investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise in reactive oxygen molecules.  This is complemented by the UK
              investigator's extensive experience with insect/host parasite systems.  The
              identification of cytotoxic molecules and knowledge of how they are produced
              will provide fundamental knowledge about the immune recognition system in
              insects.
