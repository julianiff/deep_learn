Abstract    :
              This project is developing a mathematical framework based on Renormalization
              Group (RG) theory that is capable of predicting the geometrical structure of
              very densely wired and optimized networks without recourse to empirical fitting
              parameters. The power of the RG technique is that it is not a descriptive
              theory but rather a general method for constructing theories. It is therefore
              capable of analyzing a wide range of interconnect analysis problems ranging
              from wire placement to cross-talk. It succeeds by successively renormalizing
              wire arrangements, reducing a strongly coupled, multiple-length scale problem
              to a large number of much simpler single-length scale problems. The research
              activities being carried out under this grant include: (a) the identification
              of so-called critical points in the design parameters of processing chips which
              indicate a transition from easily scaleable designs to unscaleable designs, (b)
              the development of algorithms to move these critical points to positions which
              make previously unscaleable designs scaleable, (c) to relate the theory of
              optimized interconnect geometries to the more general and universal physics of
              critical point systems which include magnets, boiling water, and percolation.
