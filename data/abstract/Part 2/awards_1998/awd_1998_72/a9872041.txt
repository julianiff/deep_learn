Abstract    :
              The aims of this project are to translate the medieval mathematical manuscript,
              "Maaseh Hoshev," and to prepare educational materials based on the translation.
               Translating such manuscripts uncovers the continuity of mathematical thought
              during the 900 years between the Greeks and the Renaissance.   The "Maaseh
              Hoshev," (literally translated as "the art of calculation") is a paradigm of
              fourteenth-century mathematics.  It contains theorems on algebraic identities
              and sums, algorithms for arithemtic and extraction of square and cube roots,
              and the earliest known proofs of certain combinatorial theorems.  Although the
              author of this manuscript is considered by some to be the greatest scientist of
              his generation, a complete translation of this work has never appeared.  In the
              Course of this project the work will be translated into English, accompanied by
              an interpretive introduction, and work on a critical edition  will be begun.
