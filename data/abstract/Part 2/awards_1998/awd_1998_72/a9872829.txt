The objective of this research is to develop new
              knowledge and technologies which integrate the advantages of optical coherence
              tomographic (OCT) imaging and optical spectroscopy.  The aim is to enable
              high-contrast, molecular-specific optical imaging of early tumors in epithelial
              tissues.  This will require the development of new biological models to allow
              rigorous testing of these concepts.  Also, the knowledge gained from these
              models will be used to develop an optical system to address the clinically
              significant problem of ovarian cancer.  The completion of these objectives will
              require:  (1) fundamental advances in the understanding of the cellular basis
              of light scattering and how it can be manipulated with extrinsic agents, (2)
              technology development for simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy, and (3)
              development of molecular contrast agents and tools to test tools and
              developments.
