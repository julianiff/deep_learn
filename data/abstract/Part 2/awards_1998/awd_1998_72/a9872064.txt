Abstract    :
              This project will utilize a novel hybrid computer code to undertake numerical
              simulations of the geospace environment.  Several unique features of the code
              make it suitable to investigations of magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling.  A
              novel generalized curvilinear coordinate system is utilized.  Particular focus
              will be in investigating the relationship between particular auroral features
              and processes in the plasma sheet and magnetotail.
