Abstract    :
              9872826  Costerton    The goals of the proposed equipment is to substantially
              enhance the  analytical and educational capability of the Center for Biofilm
              Engineering (CBE) by acquiring a state-of-the-art respiratory system.  This
              system is to allow for the measurement of gas production and comsumption during
              biotic and abiotic reactions, and is unique in that very small numbers of
              organisms can be detected via ultrasensitive gas sensors.  Such a system is
              capable of simultaneously measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia,
              hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and other key gaseous products and subtrates of
              microbial metabolism.
