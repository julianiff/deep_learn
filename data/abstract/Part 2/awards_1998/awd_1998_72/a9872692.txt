Abstract    :
              9872692  Kolodzey    This proposal addresses semiconductor device issues to
              understand the electronic properties of a novel insulator, oxidized aluminum
              nitride, and the transistors made with it. This study is important because the
              PI found that the thermal oxidization of epitaxial aluminum nitride on Si
              substrates produces aluminum oxide (sapphire) having nearly ideal electronic
              properties.  Using this aluminum oxide, the PI has made
              metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitors which behave similarly to
              conventional structures based on silicon dioxide (SiO2).  The PI would like to
              make transistors using aluminum oxide, and request the funding to enable a
              student to fabricate and test field effect transistors using oxidized aluminum
              nitride as the gate insulator.    The motivation for this research is two-fold:
              to provide information on devices using a new materials system, and to evaluate
              aluminum oxide as the gate insulator in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect
              transistors (MOSFETs), as a possible alternative to SiO2.    To address these
              questions and to provide the data to support a proposal for a more
              comprehensive program, the PI will request funding for one year of research
              under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) Program.  The funds will
              be used for a graduate student, faculty time, travel, materials and supplies. 
              The plan is to demonstrate transistor action and to enlist industrial support
              for longer term funding under the NSF GOALI program.  ***
