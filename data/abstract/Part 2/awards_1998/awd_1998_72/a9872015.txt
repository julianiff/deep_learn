Abstract    :
              This is a one-year standard award. As large-scale information-sharing
              technologies become more widespread, it is critical to understand the
              contextual elements that make them succeed and fail. Geographic information
              systems are a case in point. A substantial amount of research and experience
              indicates that, in spite of governmental calls to the contrary, few public
              agencies and governments are willing to share geographic information across
              organization boundaries, leading to substantial duplication and inefficiencies.
              Difficulties are experienced even by organizations that are willing to share
              their GIS products. The primary objective of this research, a collaborative
              project with IIS-9812520, is to formally identify and verify factors and
              processes influencing governmental agencies' sharing of geographic information
              across boundaries. The project focuses particularly on behavioral and
              organizational factors that can facilitate or inhibit the free flow of
              geographic information. A large-scale mail survey of key respondents and
              decision-makers in selected local, state, and federal agencies will be used to
              study the key information -sharing decision criteria and coordination factors,
              and which information sharing configurations yield greater benefits.  This work
              is a substantial step toward a realistic and useful model of the information
              sharing process for agencies that would benefit from free information exchange
              but to date have been loathe to make their information available to other
              parties. It will also contribute valuable insight in support of the nationwide
              initiative in developing the spatial data infrastructure.
