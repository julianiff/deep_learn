Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the propagation and dissipation of gravity waves in
              the mesopause region using theoretical modeling and lidar measurements of the
              middle atmosphere.  One element of the study involves the coupling of high
              resolution, multi-component lidar data with numerical models of nonlinear
              gravity waves to determine the dominant processes observed in the lidar data
              and their relative contribution to wave forcing in the mesopause. 
              Additionally, the investigators will use the results to develop more robust
              analysis procedures for single-component lidar measurements.  The research will
              extend the current analysis of lidar data to characterize the breaking waves
              rather than focusing on the quasi-linear characteristics that are most easily
              observed and quantified.  The study will also incorporate these results in the
              analysis of single-component lidar data to allow interpretation of data sets in
              terms of variability in different wave breaking processes.  Understanding the
              role of different wave breaking processes in the mesosphere is important for
              understanding the global circulation and assessing the long term variability of
              the middle atmosphere.
