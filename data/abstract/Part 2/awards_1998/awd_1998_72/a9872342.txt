Abstract    :
                  9872342  Mahadevan  The objective of this study is to develop a practical
              method to  estimate the time-variant reliability of mechanical and  structural
              systems.  Currently used analytical methods have  several simplifying
              assumptions regarding the loads and the  resistance to deformation which lower
              their applicability to  practical structures.  The project will develop a
              simulation-  based methodology which has advantages of robustness, ease of 
              implementation and visualization, and the capability to model  realistic
              situations.  The methodology will be sufficiently  general to include ductile
              and brittle structural behavior.  An  adaptive importance sampling simulation
              technique will be  developed to estimate the system reliability at different 
              instances of time.  A significant failure sequence of the  structure is the
              starting point for the adaptive simulation.   This project will extend the idea
              of importance sampling to  structures with multiple failure sequences and
              time-varying loads  and resistance to deformation.  ***
