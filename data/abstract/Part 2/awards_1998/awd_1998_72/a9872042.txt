Abstract    :
                                                       Taghon, Fuller, Kerkhof, Reimers : 
              OCE-9872042    The  occurrence of subtidal pumping is a common, but  poorly 
              understood feature of many continental shelves.  This  group  of  PIs  propose
              to test the hypothesis that the low organic  carbon  content  of  shelf sands
              is a  by-product  of  rapid  bacterial mineralization of organic matter (OM),
              fueled by a  high  rate  of  supply of OM and oxygen as bottom  water  is 
              advected   through  the  upper  layer  of  sediment.    Both  laboratory and
              field studies are proposed.  In the lab,  the  PIs propose to use controlled
              conditions in a seawater flume  to  attempt  to measure how variations in
              seabed topography,  sediment  permeability and flow velocity affect the 
              cycling  of OM in these sands.  The field component will be conducted  at  the 
              site of a permanent seabed observatory (LEO15)  off  the  coast  of  New 
              Jersey, where advection  driven  fluxes  through  sandy sediments are thought
              to occur.  The  results  of  this  study  will allow the PIs to quantify 
              sedimentary  fluxes and improve our understanding of this process.   This  will
              have a broad impact on our understanding of the cycling  of organic matter and
              associated elements in coastal oceans.
