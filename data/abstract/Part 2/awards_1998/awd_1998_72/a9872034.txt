Abstract    :
              DMS-9872034

The Department of Mathematics at the University of Central
              Florida will purchase computer equipment which will be  dedicated to the
              support of research in mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
              several research projects, including in particular: (1) Parabolic  Free
              Boundary Problems, Inverse Problems Versus Plant Growth, and Some Flow and Heat
              Transfer  Problems; (2) Multirate Numerical Schemes for Nonlinear  Systems; (3)
              Computer Experiments in Approximation Theory;  (4) Statistical Estimation of
              Locations of Lighting Events;  (5) Numerical Instabilities of Finite-Difference
              Schemes  and Onset of Chaotic Dynamics in Singularly Perturbed Systems.
