The objectives are(a) modeling of in-core leaching,
              and (b) experimental testing of the modeling predictions ultimately focusing on
              application to field-extracted cores. Modeling will formulate chloride
              transport of chloride in concrete with binding agents, into concrete sampling
              openings.  Variables of special interest include the opening size and geometry,
              and chloride diffusivity.  The model output will be the time evolution of free
              chloride in suitable collecting medium, with attention to evaluating the
              terminal amount as function of results acquired in a limited test time.
              Experiments will use first concrete/mortar laboratory specimens with known
              amounts of admixed chloride.  Openings of various geometries and chloride
              collecting media will be used to evaluate the time evolution of chloride in the
              media and contrast the results with model predictions.  A preliminary
              methodology will be elaborated to optimize accuracy based on the modeling and
              experimental results.  Toward the end of the investigation, the preliminary
              methodology will be applied to samples of concrete extracted from
              representative field structures, in an attempt to obtain free chloride
              concentration profiles and derive chloride binding isotherms from the
              results.
