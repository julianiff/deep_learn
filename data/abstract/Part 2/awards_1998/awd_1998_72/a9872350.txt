Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a simple and reliable accelerated
              life testing technique to predict the service life of structural polymer
              components under fatigue loading conditions. The temperature, aging time, and
              solvent concentration induced shift behavior of viscoelastic material functions
              of polymers will be utilized to accelerate the fatigue tests. Experiments under
              cyclic loading will be performed under loading frequencies that are higher than
              in-service frequencies at elevated temperatures to accelerate the time scale.
              Two different sets of tests, linked by a free volume based theory, will be
              performed: (1) short term accelerated tests at modified environmental
              conditions and at higher frequencies in loading; and (2) long term experiments
              that are conducted over long periods of time to simulate realistic loading
              conditions in practical applications. The results from these two sets of
              experiments will be analyzed and compared to facilitate the development of and
              validation of a reliable experimental life-testing technique. The practical
              significance of this research will be the provision of a simple accelerated
              life testing technique for industries that manufacture or use polymer
              components under variable amplitude fatigue loading conditions.
