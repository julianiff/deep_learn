Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Applied  Mathematics
              and Statistics (CAMS) at the New Jersey Institute  of Technology will purchase
              a four-processor server. This equipment will be dedicated to the support of 
              research by faculty and graduate students in the mathematical  sciences.  The
              equipment will  be used for several projects, including the following:

1.
              "Applications of computational solid mechanics," 
   Dawn Lott-Crumpler,

2.
              "Efficient finite-difference methods for dispersive linear waves,"
   Jonathan
              H. C. Luke,

3. "Time domain processing of underwater signals," 
  
              Zoi-Heleni Michalopoulou,

4. "Mobility control of surfactant retarded
              bubbles or drops,"
   Demetrios T. Papageorgiou,

5. Surfactant effects in
              free-surface flows,  
   Michael Siegel.
