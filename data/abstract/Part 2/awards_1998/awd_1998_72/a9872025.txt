Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science at the University
              of Illinois at Chicago will purchase computational equipment which will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular
              research in Geometric Group Theory (Paul R. Brown); Topology of 3-Manifolds
              (Marc Culler); Algebraic Geometry (Anatoly Libgober);  Theory of Finite Groups
              (Stephen Smith); and Number Theory (Jeremy Teitelbaum).  Most of these projects
              are data-intensive and amenable to distributed computing techniques.
