Abstract    :
              The technical results of this research will be: the observation of changes in
              composite and structural properties for an actual in-service composite
              structure, the use of non-destructive evaluation to identify damage modes, both
              in the laboratory and in the field, the devlopment of an understanding of the
              kinetics of degradation processes that can serve as the basis for accelerated
              testing, and the extension of the MRlife(a well-established durability
              code)durability model to polymer composite bridge deck applications.
