Abstract    :
                      Abstract  EEC-9872872  Moudgil    This award is for the purchase a
              state-of-art, custom designed atomic resolution JEOL 2010F scanning
              transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with atomic number (Z)
              contrast and capable of simultaneously obtaining structural, composition and
              bonding information from surfaces and interfacial regions of particles and
              other material systems. The proposed equipment will significantly impact the
              research and education activities of the ERC for Particle Science and
              Technology.
