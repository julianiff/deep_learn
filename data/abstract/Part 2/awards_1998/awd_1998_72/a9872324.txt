Abstract    :
              DMI-9872324  Komvopoulos  This research in Long Term Durability of Materials and
              Structures will study the effects of design and micro-fabrication on the
              micromechanical properties of polysilicon microstructures. In order to develop
              a better understanding of the relationship between cyclic stress (or strain)
              amplitude and fatigue life for polysilicon processed under different conditions
              and exposed to different environments, an innovative experimental scheme based
              upon surface micromachining technology will be used. The ultimate objective is
              to investigate the effects of fabrication process parameters (doping, etching,
              and annealing), specimen size, microstructure characteristics (grain size),
              type and amplitude of loading, and environmental conditions on the mechanical
              behavior and endurance of polysilicon thin-film microstructures.    The
              relationship between design considerations, processing parameters, and
              subsequent durability of the resulting microstructures to resist crack
              initiation will be investigated. Characterization techniques will include
              imaging and surface force microprobe experimentation, with a novel vacuum probe
              station specifically designed to simulate typical micromachine operating
              conditions, to analyze the fatigue behavior and crack initiation. This project
              will provide an excellent opportunity for training graduate students in high
              endurance design of microeletromechanical systems devices. The knowledge base
              for material deterioration at the microscale will be advanced with this work.
