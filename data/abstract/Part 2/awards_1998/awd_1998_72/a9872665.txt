Abstract    :
              AST-9872665  Crutcher    The 8th annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis
              Software and  Systems (ADASS) will be held at the University of Illinois,
              Urbana,  Illinois, November 1-4, 1998. The seven previous ADASS meetings have 
              established this series of conferences as the leading world forum for 
              scientists and programmers to discuss issues of common interest  regarding
              algorithms and software systems for the acquisition,  reduction, analysis,
              archiving, and retrieval of astronomical data.  Due  to the success of the
              ADASS conferences, ADASS is now the sole forum for  discussions of astronomical
              software and techniques. The goal of these  conferences is to facilitate the
              exchange of information and to foster  continuing communication between
              software developers (including those in  the computer industry at large) and
              users in the astronomical community.  ADASS 98 has the following components. 
              There will be two formal short  workshops taught by leading experts: An
              Introduction to Parallel  Computing and Topics in Java Application Development.
              There will be  invited talks on the special topics scheduled for ADASS 98: The
              Future  of Astronomical Computing, Advanced Visualization Technologies, PCs in 
              Astronomy, Measuring the Cosmological Constant via Automated Supernova 
              Detection, and Computer Security in a Scientific Environment. In  addition,
              there will be contributed talks, poster papers, and informal  Birds of a
              Feather sessions.  ***
