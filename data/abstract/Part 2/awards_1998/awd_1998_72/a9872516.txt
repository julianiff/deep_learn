Abstract    :
              This CRCD project supports the incorporation of tools for computer architecture
              simulation, performance prediction, program optimization and application
              characterization into computer science and engineering curricula.  Existing
              courses are being enriched in both content and with experiments not previously
              possible. This work is accomplished through use of the Purdue University
              Network Computing Hubs (PUNCH), specifically through expansion of the recently
              created Computer Architecture and Parallel Programming Hubs to include the
              tools needed by the targeted courses.  Three institutions (Purdue University,
              Northwestern University and Chicago State University) are involved in the
              project.  Purdue University is leading the effort by integrating several tools
              into two computer architecture courses and three courses on compilers and
              parallel programming.  The other two institutions are also incorporating tools
              in at least three courses on computer architecture and parallel programming. 
              All three universities are developing educational materials and are installing
              tools for shared use through PUNCH.
