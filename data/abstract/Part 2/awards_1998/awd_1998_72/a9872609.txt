The U.S. civil infrastructure is in a desperate state, and
              there is an increased interest in applying composite materials to solve
              infrastructure problems.  One application of composites is to reinforce
              concrete with their fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) bars and grids.  This
              application is particularly well suited to concrete structures subjected to a
              corrosive environment and to special structural systems that must be
              insensitive to electromagnetic fields.  In civil engineering design, a
              precursor to structural failure is often provided by the ductility of the
              system's components.  While steel reinforcing bars can provide this precursor,
              FRP reinforcements generally do not.  Approaches to this problem include
              developing hybrid reinforcing elements that exhibit higher strain at failure,
              embedding sensors in the reinforcement, and tailoring the surface structure of
              the FRP elements to provide a precursor to failure through interface slip.  All
              of these approaches benefit from a better understanding of the mechanical
              interaction between the concrete and FRP reinforcing elements - the primary
              topic of this study.  Understanding this mechanical interaction is also
              important toward understanding the durability of the FRP reinforcing
              elements.
