              ABSTRACT
EEC-9872595
Danyluk/GA Tech   

This is an Exploratory Research
              Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center 
for
              Engineering Tribology.

This joint project involves a study of the
              fundamental issues associated with chemical mechanical polishing.  In
              particular, the research will develop fundamental relationships between a
              'soft' and a 'hard' surface in the presence of fluids trapped at the interface.
               To be studied are asperity size, mechanical properties and geometric
              placement, and the influence of multiple pad liners structures on polishing
              characteristics.  The research should lead to new strategies for polishing and
              for the development of polishing machines
