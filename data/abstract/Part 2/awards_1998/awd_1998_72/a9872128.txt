Abstract    :
              This research is in extending the Graphplan algorithm, which uses disjunctive
              representation and local constraint satisfaction techniques to handle a wider
              variety of planning, rather than being restricted to the
classical planning
              assumptions of determinism and complete information.  Extensions are to allow
              contingent planning, probabilistic planning, expressive sensing actions,
              interleaved planning and execution, and
real-valued durations.  The same
              methodology that characterizes the PI's previous research are being used: a
              balance between theoretical rigor (proofs of soundness and completeness) and
              empirical evaluation of
implementation performance.  Source code of the
              implementations will be distributed, and it is anticipated that better, more
              versatile fast planning algorithms will
              result.
