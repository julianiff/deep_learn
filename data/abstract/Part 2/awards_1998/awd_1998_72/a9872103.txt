Under an SGER award a feasibility study will evaluate the
              fractal nature of electrode surfaces of rechargeable batteries in time and
              space and whether the fractal characteristics have potential for assessing the
              long-term life of these batteries.  Initial work will focus on zinc-air and
              nickel-zinc cells.  Roughness will be measured at various times during cycling
              using optical profilometry and atomic force microscopy.  Spatial and temporal
              self-similarity will be analyzed numerically and graphically and combined into
              one mathematical scaling formula of the asympototic long-range and long-time
              behavior.
