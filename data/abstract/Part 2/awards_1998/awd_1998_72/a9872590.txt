Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  THOMPSON  EEC-9872590    The Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) for Nondestructive Evaluation is being renewed for the first
              year of a five year continuing grant.  In accordance with the announcement of
              the competition and NSF Announcement 97-164, the Center addressed the
              requirement for significantly new intellectual substance with thrusts that
              focus on the reliability of structural systems by developing a set of tools
              that allow nondestructive evaluation to be integrated with the manufacturing
              and life cycle of structural components.     The new research to be added to
              the Center will address 1.) reliability of structural systems, 2.) application
              to nondestructural materials and 3.) NDE technique development.    This award
              is the result of a competition and starts a new life-cycle for the Center in
              accordance with NSF Announcement 97-164.
