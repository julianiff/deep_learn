Abstract    :
              The  purpose of the workshop is to discuss and develop a plan for  a  research 
              program to advance the state of the  art  in  speech  synthesis  technology.  
              A  group of  participants  will  include  government,  industry,  and  academic
              representatives,  who  have  expertise in a number of areas directly or
              indirectly related  to  speech synthesis.  The workshop program includes both
              plenary and  breakout   sessions,  with  presentations  from   many   of   the 
              participants.   The focus will be on identifying  key  technology  during  the 
              first day and on developing new ideas for evaluation  and  research 
              infrastructure needs during  the  second  day.   A  report of the workshop
              findings will be presented to the sponsors  and the public.
