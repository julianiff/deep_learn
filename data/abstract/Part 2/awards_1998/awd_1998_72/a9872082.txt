Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9872082  A. Couzis/CUNY    A novel idea to develop a simple, fast
              and cost effective, preliminary screening method will be explored for the
              development of modified polymers in new applications, such a gas separations
              and waste remorse from aqueous streams.  This method would allow for the
              testing of the permeation selectivity properties of a large number of polymers
              with various side chain structures.  In the approach used, the synthesis of
              these polymers will not be required, allowing running of screening experiments
              faster and with significantly reduced cost over the current practices.  To do
              the use of supported self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of surfactants as models
              of the polymer membranes will be explored.  The surfactant forming the SAMs
              will have the same side chain as the membrane-forming polymer, but they are not
              monomeric and cannot be used in the polymer's synthesis.  Because a very large
              number of these self-assembling surfactants already exists, model SAMs for a
              large number of polymers can be formed without the need for any synthetic
              effort reducing the time required to screen side chains to just a few hours for
              each sample.  This sample-screening tool would then become an important part in
              the development efforts for improved polymer membrane materials required by
              industry.    ***
