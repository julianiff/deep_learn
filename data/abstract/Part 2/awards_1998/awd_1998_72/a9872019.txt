Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will
              purchase a high performance workgroup server which will be dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including in particular: wave motion in
              multiphase reactive flows; machine learning in data mining; medical tomography;
              image and signal analysis.
