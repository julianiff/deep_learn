Abstract    :
              Systems-on-a-chip (SOCs) contain predesigned subsystems that  contain
              intellectual property (IP) from many sources. IP-  based design technologies
              allow the use of predesigned  subsystems, which facilitate the design of
              complex, critical  systems. However, it introduces some fundamental problems in
               validation. This research is exploring methodologies for  lifetime validation
              for ensuring that an IP based SOC  operates within acceptable correctness
              bounds over its  projected lifetime. Here, validation means the task of 
              ensuring that a system contains no undetected design errors  or physical faults
              that can cause a critical system failure.  An integrated approach to design
              verification and physical  fault testing for SOCs employing components, whose 
              implementation or validation status is incompletely, known  is being pursued.
              The research focuses on two related  issues: (1) devising synthetic models of
              design errors that  lead to high quality design validation methods; and (2) 
              validating designs that contain IP-style circuits.  Functional testing methods
              that provide implementation-  independent fault coverage are being developed.
              The research  includes theoretical studies and experimental work using 
              university-industry designs, with emphasis on hard-to-detect  faults and
              safety-critical applications.
