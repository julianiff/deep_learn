Abstract    :
              The PI will study practical algorithms for approximation and exact solutions of
              some network design problems such as finding a lowest cost. spanning subgraph
              of a weighted graph that provides k-connectivity between all nodes.  The PI
              will also investigate the use of sparse certificates in the context of matching
              and maximum flow problems.  The goal is to use sparse certificates for pruning
              away a subset of the edges that do not contribute to optimal solutions, thus
              reducing the size of the graph that is processed.
