Abstract    :
              Studies of the global carbon cycle are motivated by the need to predict future
              trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), to define responses of the
              terrestrial biosphere and oceans to changing CO2 and climate. Currently the
              best constraints on marine and terrestrial fluxes are derived by inverse
              analysis, where concentration data for CO2 and other species from global
              surface observations are analyzed using global models of biogeochemistry and
              atmospheric transport. One of the largest sources of uncertainty for current
              inverse studies is the "rectification" of seasonal and diurnal oscillations of
              CO2 fluxes, in which correlation between biophysical fluxes and rates for
              transport produce large scale, stationary concentration gradients in the
              atmosphere; validation data for this phenomenon are currently
              unavailable.
	This study will provide comprehensive data of the CO2 gradients
              due to rectification. This will be accomplished via airborne measurements of
              CO2, CO (carbon monoxide), SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), 13CO2, and other tracers
              in and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over North America and adjacent
              ocean regions in two campaigns (summer and winter), supplemented by intensive
              diurnal observations in and above the PBL in selected regions. This project is
              supported jointly by NSF, DOE, NASA and NOAA.
