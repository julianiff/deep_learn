Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the study of constrained cuts in graphs, with
              special emphasis on the characterization of edge-isoperimetric structures in
              subclasses such as multidimensional arrays and tori, and the related
              computational complexity of constrained edge-boundary calculations in planar
              graphs.  Classically, isoperimetric inequalities provide estimates about how
              large a quantity such as the volume of a body can be, given only its surface
              area.  The discrete analogue of this notion applied to graphs measures types of
              connectivity of the graph and has many important applications in algorithm
              design.  Despite the extensive literature on this subject, algorithmic
              complexity of fundamental questions such as planar graph partitioning and the
              problem of the identification of edge-isoperimetric sets in highly structured
              product graphs are not completely understood.  The main problems investigated
              in this project include: (1) study of the exact computational complexity of
              various graph partitioning problems in planar graphs, (2) study of invariants
              such as the edge-isoperimetric number for general classes of high dimensional
              arrays and tori.  Preliminary results have been on special types of
              multidimensional arrays, and made use of compression, layout techniques, and
              graph embedding.  In addition to being of theoretical interest, a deeper
              understanding of these issues may result in improved algorithms for routing,
              scheduling, VLSI layout, and other applications.
