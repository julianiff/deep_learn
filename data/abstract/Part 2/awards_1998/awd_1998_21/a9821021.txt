Abstract    :
              

 This project will purchase equipment to upgrade an existing uniaxial
              servo-hydraulic materials testing system at Clarkson Unversity.  Digital
              control equipment specifically designed for servo-hydraulic materials testing
              systems will be purchased to replace aging analug controllers.  Hydraulic
              collet grips and a speciman alignment fixture will also be purchased.  This
              equpiment will enable the existing equipment to be used for tension-compression
              fatigue testing of metals, and will help to alleviate over-scheduling of
              Clarkson's axial-torsional testing machine.  The primary use for this testing
              system will be to conduct cyclic tests on single crystals and vrious grain size
              polycrystals of high stacking fault energy metals such as nickel, in research
              to explore the effect of controllable microstructure on cyclic mechanical
              behavior.  Examples of other uses will be : (1) to conduct fatigue testing of
              duplex stainless steel - a dual phase material exhibiting higher strength  and
              corrosion resistance than conventional stainless steels, (2) to conduct
              controlled tests on geotechnical material such as sandy soils and clays and
              (3)to conduct tests on specimens coated with mechanically deposited ceramic
              powders to assess coating adhesion properties.
