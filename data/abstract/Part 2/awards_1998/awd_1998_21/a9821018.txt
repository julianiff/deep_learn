This research project will design, prototype, and
              experimentally evaluate both integrated guided wave and free-space
              micro-optical systems for achieving process compatible, integrated optical
              monitoring (IOM) for in-situ metrology, state feedback, and control of MEMS.
              Leveraging the knowledge base developed within the optical interconnect
              research community, polymer integrated optical waveguide and planar/folded
              diffractive micro-optics technologies will be defined for routine insertion of
              optics within surface micromachined (SMM) MEMS. Development and evaluation of
              IOM based on these technologies will be accomplished within selected testbeds
              fabricated using established SMM foundries (e.g. MUMPS, Sandia MDL) in order to
              facilitate the acceptance and use of the developed IOM techniques by the MEMS
              community. Testbeds will consist of "standard cell" MEMS with generic
              micromechanical functions as well as a complex application specific MEMS
              comprised of coupled generic devices. Leveraging an ongoing formal
              collaboration, the Sandia Microengine will serve as the application specific
              testbed. Closed-loop control systems using IOM-based state feedback will be
              developed for generic testbed MEMS and these systems then used as building
              blocks in the control of the Microengine application specific testbed.
