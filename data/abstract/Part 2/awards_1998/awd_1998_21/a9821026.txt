Abstract    :
              

The proposed research is to investigate the transmission impairment of
              optical fibers for AM/QAM CATV systems due to fiber nonlinearities.  The PI
              proposes to investigate the following topics: (1) SBS suppression techniques;
              (2) modulation instability in single-channel links; (3) use of dispersion
              management for reducing the impact of nonlinearity, (4) cancellation techniques
              for reducing SRS and XPM crosstalks; and (5) optical carrier suppression.  The
              work also involves industrial collaboration with Harmonic Lightwaves.
