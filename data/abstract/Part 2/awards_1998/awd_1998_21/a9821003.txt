Abstract    :
                   A subatomic measuring machine with a lateral range of 25 x 25 mm and a
              vertical range of100 um is to be built.  A previously developed stage will be
              used as a base.  Building the world's most accurate measuring machine for
              atomic-scale features over IC-chip size sample is immediately to provide a
              novel instrument for the metrology of integrated circuits.  Principles
              applicable to the design of wafer steppers and scanners for the production of
              integrated circuits in 0.1 um and smaller feature sizes are going to also be
              demonstrated.  Thus, both metrology and manufacturing machine design techniques
              will be developed.  Major tasks are to develop a metrology near-field scanning
              optical microscope (NSOM) or other scanned probe microscope that has the
              inherent accuracy of the system, to measure a sample grid plate (mask) that was
              manufactured by Hewlett Packard and calibrated at the Physikalische Technische
              Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany and to use self-calibration techniques to map
              all of the errors of the stage to a level at least a factor of IO better than
              current instruments.
     The project is likely to generate the methodology
              and instrumentation necessary to push positioning of macroscopic objects to
              subatomic accuracies over commercially significant ranges.  These accuracies
              and ranges will be required by the next generation of micro-circuits.
