This dissertation-enhancement award supports Kenneth N.
              Stevens's graduate student, Janet Slifka, from the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology, to work with Gunnar Fant of the Department of Speech, Music and
              Hearing at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The research
              will focus on understanding how variations in lung pressure affect changes in
              sounds produced during normal speech.  Dr. Fant runs a group with unique
              experience in modeling speech production and determining acoustical effects of
              changes in the vocal tract, larynx, and respiratory system.  Ms. Slifka will
              use the KTH models to analyze data collected at MIT.
