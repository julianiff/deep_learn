Abstract    :
                   In high-speed and high-precision machining, the interactions between the
              cutting tool and the workpiece are extremely important and complex.  They
              affect tool life, process economics, and surface integrity of the machined
              product.  To understand these interactions, finite element method (FEM) based
              metal flow simulation techniques will be used to establish the effect of
              process conditions (feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed) upon cutting
              forces, tool temperatures and stresses, and tool failure.  The project consists
              of the following tasks:  (1) Orthogonal turning and milling tests will be
              conducted to establish a methodology for determining the flow stress data under
              high strain rate, strain and temperature conditions encountered in machining;
              (2) A computer program will be developed to predict forces, stresses, and
              temperatures in three-dimensional practical machining processes such as face
              milling, drilling, and ball-end milling; and (3) A wear model will be validated
              to predict tool wear in function of process variables and tool material and
              coating.  Modeling techniques based on the physics of the cutting process will
              be used to demonstrate how to estimate tool wear, improve tool and insert
              design, and optimize process conditions.
     The results of this project are
              expected to contribute significantly to the fundamental understanding of metal
              cutting operations;  and,  reducing the amount of experimentation needed to
              establish and optimize high speed machining operations in an industrial
              environment.
