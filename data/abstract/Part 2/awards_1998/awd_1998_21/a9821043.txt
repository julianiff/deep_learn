Abstract    :
              More than 100 steel moment resisting frame buildings exhibited brittle
              connection fracture during the Northridge earthquake of 1994 and similar
              fractures were also observed following the Earthquake of 1995 in Japan. 
              Despite extensive laboratory testing of large and small scale structures since
              then, factors leading to brittle fractures in these welded joints have not yet
              been identified.  Recent studies on the causes for the brittle fracture have
              focused primarily on the structural design of these connections.  However,
              local material properties of the steel in these welded joints are probably of
              equal importance to the causes and the failure of these connections.  Design
              modifications in welded steel moment resisting connections deal with reducing
              global stresses.  They do little to reduce local stresses.  The aim of this
              research project is to develop a modified welding procedure specifically
              designed to ensure that ductile, fine grained microstructure will develop in
              the "critical region" of the connection where cracks commonly initiate due to
              the high stresses which are invariably present will be considerably reduced and
              triaxial stresses which are inherent in the connection will be less damaging
              due to the higher fracture toughness in the critical region.  As a result the
              welded beam-to-column joint will exhibit and enhanced performance and brittle
              fracture may be avoided.  The residual stresses due to welding will be measured
              by Scanning Acoustic Imaging of Stress, a newly developed acoustic microscopy
              technique, that allows stresses to be mapped with high spatial resolution. 
              This research involves active collaboration with Japanese researchers at the
              University of Tokyo and Kyoto University in Japan.
