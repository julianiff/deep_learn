This research concerns on-line algorithms and is
              focused on two problems, generalizing well-known open problems.  The first is:
              the given any on-line algorithm and any specific kind of restriction on
              computational power memory or information flow, does there exist, an on-line
              algorithm that satisfies this restriction and is still optimal (among all
              on-line algorithms)?  The second is the question whether randomization helps
              for the 2-server problem.

In particular, the project introduces a new
              restriction on information flow for on-line algorithms called tracklessness and
              seeks to answer the above questions for trackless on-line algorithms.

Some
              effort will also be expended on the major problem of the area, the k-server
              conjecture. 

Besides the server problem, the research will attempt to settle
              a number of other on-line problems for which optimal competitiveness is
              unknown, including:  randomized list update, multiprocessor scheduling, and
              page migration.

A number of tools developed by the PI (in conjunction with
              Chrobak) have been used successfully, by them and by others, including
              workfunctions, pseudocost, competitive games, and convex hulls.  Computer
              simulations are an essential tool in the research.  A major component of the
              work in finding additional generic tools for classes of problems.
