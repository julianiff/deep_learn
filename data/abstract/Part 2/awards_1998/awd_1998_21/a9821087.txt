Abstract    :
              It can be difficult to tell which learning algorithm is best for a particular
              situation.  The bias of many on-line learning algorithms can be encoded with a
              "distance function" on the hypothesis space, and (for simple problems) an
              amortized analysis can be used to provide relative performance guarantees
              (analogous to the competitive ratios for k-server problems).  These guarantees
              can be used to indicate when one bias is more appropriate than another,
              allowing an intelligent choice of learning algorithm.

This project explores
              the connection between the distance functions over hypotheses and the Bregman
              divergences used in convex optimization.  By adapting the tools developed for
              Bregman divergences, the investigators will improve and generalize the
              performance guarantees.  This will result in more accurate predictions of how
              well the various learning algorithms will perform on a wider variety of
              problems.  Furthermore, the improved understanding will enable the derivation
              of new learning algorithms tailored to specific situations.
