Abstract    :
              


The proposed research is a renewal of ECS-9710631 that was awarded  for a
              period of 12 months in FY98. This is a collaborative research between
              Northwestern University (Kumar) and Stanford University (Fejer) began in
              February 1998.  The research goal is to develop compact and reliable sources of
              highly-squeezed light using lithium niobate waveguides.  The proposed project
              includes activities in (1) improving the amount of squeezing obtained from
              waveguide devices, (2) implementing a novel Sagnac squeezing geometry, and (3)
              demonstrating integrated waveguide squeezing devices.
