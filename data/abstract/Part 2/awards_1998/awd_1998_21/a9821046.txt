This Americas Program award will support travel and
              related expenses for 8 senior and 4 junior US researchers to participate in an
              international multidisciplinary seminar on the paleoecology of the Cenozoic of
              South America, to take place in La Paz, Bolivia, May 19-22, 1999.  Organizers
              are Drs. Bruce J. MacFadden, University of Florida, and Bruce J. Shockey, NSF
              International Research Fellow and Fulbright Scholar, presently assigned to the
              National Museum of Natural History (MNHN), La Paz.  The foreign organizer is
              
Dr. Federico Anaya Daza, Chief, Department of Paleontology, of the Museum. 
              Participants include paleomammalogists, functional morphologists,
              paleobotanists and geochemists..  	  

Through most of the Cenozoic (Age of
              Mammals), South America was an island continent, having an endemic faunal
              population that evolved in isolation from the rest of the globe.  However, the
              rise of the Andes and the formation of the Panamanian land bridge radically
              changed the continent, both physically and biotically. This unique
              biogeographical history offers rare opportunities for evolutionary studies. The
              strange nature of the original South American fauna and the complex changes
              that occurred at that time challenge our understanding of the environmental
              conditions in which Neotropical life evolved.  The purpose of this seminar is
              to summarize and assess the knowledge regarding the paleoecology and
              paleoclimatology of the Cenozoic; discuss what the major deficits are in our
              current state of knowledge; and develop new collaborative relationships to
              focus on areas that are deemed important for the advancement of our
              understanding of those complex evolutionary changes. 

Bolivia is the site of
              several important paleontological localities, and holding the activity there
              will give more researchers an opportunity to become acquainted with them, as
              well as with the Museum's important research collections.
