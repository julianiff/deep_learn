Abstract    :
              This project investigates several algorithm design issues in the areas of
              Universal Graphs, Data Compression, Generalized Huffman trees, and Data
              Structures.  The PI and his student have designed a new tree paradigm for the
              construction of small universal graphs for many classes of graphs.  The
              technique permits a multistage decomposition of a graph while constraining the
              adjacency properties between blocks of the decomposition.  The project refines
              and explores other applications of this technique.  Within the area of data
              compression, an analysis of the worst case performance of several exciting new
              data compression schemes will be undertaken.  In addition, design of fast
              algorithms for these schemes is challenging and worthwhile.  Closely associated
              with data compression is the classic Huffman Coding problem.  The project
              investigates the design of efficient algorithms for some natural
              generalizations of this coding problem.  During the last two decades, the PI
              has developed several attractive procedures for transforming data
              structure-based algorithms which have good amortized speed into ones that have
              matching worst-case speed characteristics. These techniques are broadened to
              handle generalized dictionaries and other data structure problems.
