Abstract

The objective of this project is to characterize the
              reaction chemistry of the plasmas-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of
              silicon dioxide and silicon nitride films at atmospheric pressure.  Previous
              work includes that high-quality silicon-dioxide films can be deposited at rates
              up to 3000 Angstroms/min. using a newly developed atmospheric-pressure plasma
              jet.  In this study, the identities of the reactive species formed in oxygen
              and nitrogen plasma jets is determined using optical absorption and emission
              spectroscopies, chemical titration, and laser-induced fluorescence.  In
              addition, species adsorbed on film surfaces during growth are monitored by
              multiple-internal reflection infrared spectroscopy.  Models of coupled gas and
              surface reactions occurring in the plasma-jet reactor are developed.  By
              combining numerical simulations with experimental results, descriptions of the
              reaction mechanisms for deposition of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride are
              obtained.

PECVD of dielective thin films is an essential part of the
              manufacture of semiconductor devices including integrated circuits and
              thin-film transistors used in flat-panel displays.  This effort explores a new
              plasma source, the atmospheric-pressure plasma jet.  It offers greater
              knowledge of the reaction chemistry in plasma reactors that should stimulate
              advances in design, operation, and control of these exists.
