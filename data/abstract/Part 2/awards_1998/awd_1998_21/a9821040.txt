Abstract    :
              This project extends the "Polynomial Method" in computational complexity theory
              to involve polynomial ideas and algebraic geometry.  The attraction is that the
              latter concepts are hard enough to surmount the "Natural Proofs" obstacle to
              progress on lower bounds, yet are still part of a natural and important body
              mathematics.  The Grobner theory of polynomial ideas shows regard in which the
              permanent function is more complex than the determinant, and combining it with
              an idea analogous to Hastad's method of restrictions shows promise of
              separating the permanent's complexity class #P from the NC hierarchy.  The
              project also aims to quantify the computational significance of non-uniformity
              in circuit classes, growing out from the tightening the "Size-expansion
              tradeoffs" on circuits for natural computational problems obtained by the PI,
              determining whether the "Natural Proofs" framework carries over irom polynomial
              to quasilinear tine, and extending work by Forthnow on quasi-linear size
              circuit classes.  The objective of this work is to increase scientific
              knowledge about the intrinsic cost of computational problems, which is
              important to researchers in many fields.
