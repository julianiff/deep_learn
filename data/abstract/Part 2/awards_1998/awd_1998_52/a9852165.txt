Abstract    :
              The Long Beach Elementary Science/Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership
              (LBESTEP) is a three-year effort to improve and focus K-8 teacher preparation
              in mathematics and the sciences in Long Beach. Long Beach is a notably diverse
              urban community, and home of both the third largest school system in
              California, and the Long Beach Seamless Education Initiative (LBSEI) founded in
              1994. LBSEI is dedicated to K-18 seamless education in all disciplines through
              strong partnerships between California State University at Long Beach (CSULB),
              Long Beach City College (LBCC), and Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD).
              Through the LBSEI, as well as through linkages to existing excellent NSF-CETP
              programs such as LACTE and MASTEP in California, we will undertake four major
              activities: (1) prepare the faculty and the institutions of higher education to
              undertake reform of math/science curriculum; (2) build pre-service teacher
              involvement in science and mathematics, through a variety of strategies; (3)
              reform undergraduate science/mathematics in core Liberal Students courses to
              align them with national standards and best practices in both content and
              pedagogy; and (4) broaden the offering in K-8 pre-service curricula to include
              choices such as math/science "specialist." we will involve scientists and
              mathematicians from LBCC and CSULB in all aspects of the teacher preparation
              program, through workshops and participation in team teaching and faculty
              mentoring. Oversight for LBESTEP will be provided through outside evaluator and
              National Visiting Committee assessment.
