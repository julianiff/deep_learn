Abstract    :
              The University of Illinois at Chicago-Community College Collaborative for
              Excellence in Teacher Preparation is an initiative to significantly strengthen
              programs for the preparation of K-12 teachers who complete their preservice
              curriculum at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The Collaborative
              involves UIC and six community college partners that are major sources of
              transfer students for UIC-William Rainey Harper Community College, Oakton
              Community College, Olive-Harvey College, Triton College, Truman College, and
              Harold Washington College. The project also has strong connections with the
              Chicago Public Schools and surrounding Chicago-area school districts. The
              Collaborative emphasizes activities in seven categories: 1) faculty
              development; 2) mathematics and science course and curriculum development; 3)
              mentoring and induction for mathematics and science teachers in their initial
              years of teaching; 4) recruitment and retention of outstanding teacher
              candidates, with a special focus on high quality candidates from
              underrepresented groups; 5) stronger collaboration and articulation between
              UIC, community colleges, and schools; 6) institutionalization and dissemination
              of project activities and products; and 7) research and evaluation.
