Abstract    :
              9860367
     This small business Innovative research Phase I project addresses
              the development of non-porous membranes being developed for harsh chemical gas
              separations. In this program we will evaluate a number of potential attractive
              chemically resistant non-porous membranes and associated chemically resistant
              supports. To-date, no non-porous chemically resistant membranes are
              commercially available.
In Phase I, we will develop laboratory membranes and
              evaluate their capability to separate hydrogen from chlorine associated with
              the chlor-alkali process tail gas streams. In Phase II we will evaluate other
              harsh chemical separations (eg HF, C2H4F2) and also perform actual testing on
              commercial tail gas stream.
     These fluoropolymers, in combination with
              existing thin film processes and chemically resistant porous supports, should
              significantly expand the usage of membranes for a range of applications in the
              Chemical Process Industries (CPI). Key commercial applications include halogen
              separations, such as H2-C12 separations in the chlor-alkali industries, and
              fluorochemistry processes using HF.
