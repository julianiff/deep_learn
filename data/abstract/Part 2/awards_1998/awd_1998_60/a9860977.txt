Abstract    :
              9860977
     Deregulation and restructuring in the electric power industry is
              resulting in many new players attempting to utilize the high voltage electric
              transmission system.  Transmission system capacity is limited due to a number
              of different mechanisms including:  (1) transmission line thermal limits; ( 2) 
              bus voltage limits; (3) transient stability constraints;  and (4) the need to
              maintain system voltage stability.  Presently, a number of useful tools exist
              to access the first three constraints.                                         
                                                         In this project, PowerWorld Corp.
              Inc. will develop a new software tool, which utilizes a path independent model
              for voltage stability assessment using energy method approaches.  Advantages of
              energy methods include path independence, ability to provide measures of
              voltage stability in particular regions and potential for relatively low
              computational requirements.
