Abstract    :
              9860931
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              aims to develop reliable, low-voltage electron emitters based on III-nitride
              materials. For field-emission applications, the desired wide band-gap
              semiconductor should negative electron affinity, n-type doping and ability to
              form low-resistance contacts. The wide-band-gap AlxGa1-xN materials (O<x<l) are
              very promising for field-emission applications because of their low to negative
              electron affinity. Alx,Ga1-xN (x>0.75) films exhibit a negative electron
              affinity while GaN exhibits a positive electron affinity of ~3.0 eV. AIN films
              are essentially insulators. In contrast, GaN can be doped easily with n-type
              dopants. We believe that by changing the value of x in the AlxGa1-xN
              composition, the value of electron affinity and n-type doping can be
              simultaneously optimized for field-emission applications. In Phase-I, we will
              optimize the AlGaN materials for field-emission applications. The primary
              synthesis approach is ultra high vacuum evaporation in combination with a novel
              nitrogen ion source. UHV evaporation offers the impurity control characteristic
              of MBE, but at growth rates approaching those for OMCVD. In Phase-II, we will
              fabricate and optimize various field emitter device structures using AlGaN
              graded layers.
       Potential commercial applications of this technology
              include vacuum microelectronic devices, electron guns, flat-panel displays and
              high power devices.
