Abstract    :
              9860310
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              engineer the rate of cereal seedling development by targeting a key gene of
              starch breakdown. Rapid embryo growth is a problem for the malting industry due
              to the wasteful production of biomass in the seedlings. Controlling the
              seedling growth rate provides opportunities for increasing the protein yield of
              this process. Inhibition of glucosidase via antisense gene expression in
              transgenic cereal seeds will restrict starch breakdown and glucose production.
              Restricted production of glucose will control the rate of germination and limit
              the growth of the embryo while allowing protein production to continue at a
              high rate in the seeds.
     Transgenic cereal seedlings can be malted for use
              as a bioreactor to produce a wide range of valuable proteins, including human
              proteins for pharmaceutical use and a wide range of industrial enzymes. In the
              malting industry cereal seeds are traditionally used as sources of amylolytic
              enzymes and fermentable sugars. Enhanced protein yields resulting from
              controlling the rate of seedling growth will increase the economic efficiency
              and competitiveness of both this newly emerging biotechnology industry and the
              traditional malting industry.
