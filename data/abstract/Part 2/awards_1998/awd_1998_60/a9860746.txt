Abstract    :
              9860746
     Biofouling, the growth of microbiologically active films
              (biofilms) on surfaces, adversely  affects  both the short and long term
              performance of many aqueous systems. Efficiency of heat exchangers is degraded
              by the thermal resistance of biofilms, increased pressure and decreased flow
              accompany the constriction of piping systems fouled with biofilms, and
              microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) contributes to the reduction of
              system lifetimes. Open-loop seawater or fresh water systems are of particular
              concern because biocide contaminant levels in discharge water are subject to
              regulation.
Monitoring biofilm development in real time would allow for
              optimization of biofouling control strategies, which would reduce system
              operating and maintenance costs and reduce environmental pollution.
In this
              Phase I effort, Sensor Research and Development Corporation intends to
              demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the mature technology of the quartz
              crystal microbalance (QCM) in a novel configuration to monitor the growth of
              seawater biofilms in real time. The monitor is expected to be low cost,
              compact, and rugged; allowing for its widespread use in the control of
              biofouling in many applications.
     A real time biofouling monitor will
              provide information on the development of biofilms on the surfaces of piping
              and cooling systems prior to the manifestation of overall system performance
              degradation, thereby allowing for control strategies that will minimize biocide
              use, maximize system performance, and provide confidence that system parameters
              are within an acceptable range. Markets include: shipboard cooling systems,
              both seawater and freshwater based; on-shore power plants utilizing seawater or
              freshwater cooling; aquaculture seawater systems; and food industry processing
              systems.
