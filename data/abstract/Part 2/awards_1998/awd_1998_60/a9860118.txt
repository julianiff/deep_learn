Abstract    :
              9860118
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will examine a novel retrofitable, high efficiency, variable capacity cooling
              system that uses the expansion/condensation cycle in a new way.  Industry uses
              significant amounts of energy for air conditioning, water chilling, process
              cooling, and refrigeration.  By using a novel refrigerant combined with an
              adjustable expansion device,  system capacity may be incrementally increased 
              by 30 to 50 percent on demand, while simultaneously achieving a 5-10 percent
              increase in energy efficiency.  Phase I  objectives are to identify suitable
              candidate refrigerants, assemble a bench-top test unit, and perform tests and
              cost analysis to establish feasibility.  Candidate refrigerants will be
              identified using a systematic evaluation process.  Bench-top tests will measure
              cooling capacity and energy efficiency with and without the novel improvement
              so that a direct comparison can be made.  Performance and costs will be
              estimated for a range of cooling applications.
     The new technology could
              be designed in or retrofitted to cooling systems and would have wide
              application in all types of refrigeration, air conditioning, water chilling,
              and process cooling systems.  Based on the size of current industrial,
              transportation, and domestic cooling markets, the potential market is $100
              million to $1 billion annually for a new variable capacity cooling system.
