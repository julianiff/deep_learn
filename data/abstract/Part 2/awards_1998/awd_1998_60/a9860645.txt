Abstract    :
              9860645
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
              evaluate the feasibility of using computational steering to reduce the time to
              simulate turbulent reacting flows within fossil-fuel fired industrial boilers
              and furnaces. Our strategy includes developing a computational workbench with
              tightly integrated tools for comprehensive turbulent Reacting Flow simulation;
              leading edge visualization; simple model modification. The new tool will be
              based on: Reaction Engineering International's turbulent, two phase Reacting
              Flow models; and the SCIRun problem-solving environment developed by the
              University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging research group.
     The
              targeted market-sector for the new tool is the analysis of fossil-fuel fired
              steam generators and other combustion systems. Our intention is to create a
              computational tool that can put the power of detailed Reacting Flow
              Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations into the hands of engineers that
              are not CFD experts. Utility boilers represent an attractive market because of
              their high capital cost, long life expectancy and increased emphasis on cost
              reduction and pollution control.
