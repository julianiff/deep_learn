Abstract    :
              9860689
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop a highly versatile confocal fiber optic module (CFOM) which can be
              easily adapted to existing microscopes.  The CFOM system, proposed by
              Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), utilizes state-of-the-art optical fiber
              technology to offer extreme compactness, multiple light coupling/excitation (l
              x N coupling), minimal adjustment, and very low cost. While confocal microscopy
              has become a powerful tool, current confocal microscopes, based on free-space
              optics, lack versatility.   Conventional confocal microscope optics are bulky,
              and the enormous cost of commercially available confocal instruments has
              prevented most researchers from sharing in the advantages offered by this
              highly powerful technology.  With the continuing scarcity of funds and
              tightening of budgets, confocal microscopes are becoming less and less
              available to researchers. A unique advantage of IOS's device for conventional
              confocal microscopy is the fact that it can be sold as a "retrofittable" unit.
              This unit can be added to most existing commercial microscopes to facilitate a
              variety of biomedical applications.
     The use of fiber optics-based module
              offers confocal microscope capability will significantly reduce the cost of the
              system, increase the versatility of the wavelength selection, and increase the
              popularity of using confocal effect for many different important
              applications.
