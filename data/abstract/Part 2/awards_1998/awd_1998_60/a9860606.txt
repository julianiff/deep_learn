     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will evaluate a low cost high speed, high resolution hybrid resin for
              rapid prototyping (RP).   In polymer-based RP systems, the laser subsystem is
              the major bottleneck in throughput and is the principal cost driver.  Twin
              innovations will serve to minimize these effects:  (1) a novel resin system
              that cures upon exposure to infrared (IR) radiation; and (2) replacement of a
              single-beam UV laser with an inexpensive linear array of IR lasers having tens
              of thousands of emitters.  Instead of a flying spot driven by a modulator and
              deflection mirrors,  a linear array can be shuttled across the work surface,
              completing one layer per sweep.  Instead of varying the dwell time to control
              shrinkage, the output intensity of  individual emitters will be variably
              controlled. 
     Potential commercial applications include all present and
              future polymer-based rapid prototyping systems. Markets include new equipment
              sales, retrofits to existing systems, and after market sales of resin and
              replacement parts.  Instead of employing a $100,000 UV laser with a lifetime
              less than 5,000 hours, one IR array with a lifetime in excess of 100,000 hours 
              can be employed at only slightly greater expense.  The net result is a
              significant reduction in subsystem complexity and cost of ownership, coupled
              with order of magnitude increases in throughput and reliability.
