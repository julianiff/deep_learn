Abstract    :
              9860955
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              addresses the need for reliable, low cost, high resolution monitoring of
              atmospheric water vapor.  A 50-microjoule per pulse, 10-kilohertz optical
              parametric oscillator (OPO) will be investigated to profile water vapor using
              the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique.  This OPO, pumped with
              532-nanometer (nm) radiation, will use a new nonlinear material - periodically
              poled lithium tantalum oxide (PPLT).   PPLT is used because of its high
              transparency in the ultraviolet .  This is thought to be the first
              investigation of 532 nm and 355 nm pumping of PPLT OPOs.  Photorefractive
              effects on OPO performance and beam quality will be measured at 532 nm and 355
              nm for crystal operating temperatures between 100 and 350 degrees Celsius.  The
              result of this research is expected to be an experimentally verified DIAL
              transmitter design.
     Commercial applications of this research include
              molecular imaging and optical biopsies.  High repetition rate, low-pulse energy
              lasers operating between 400 and 700 nm (achieved by pumping a PPLT OPO with
              355 nm) are needed as excitation sources for fluorophores, in molecular
              imaging, and for fluorescence return signatures, in optical biopsies.  High
              volume production for these commercial markets is expected to lower the per
              unit cost of DIAL transmitters significantly.
