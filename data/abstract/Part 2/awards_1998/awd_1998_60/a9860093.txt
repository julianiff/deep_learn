Abstract    :
              9860093
     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to
              produce a family of novel liquid crystal modified electrorheological (ER)
              fluids.  This proposed work builds upon promising earlier research on single
              component liquid crystalline ER fluids and combines it with the traditional two
              component fluid to prepare ER fluids with much improved properties. The
              proposed novel ER fluid would have shorter response times and higher magnitude
              of ER effect. The results of the proposed research will lead to an
              understanding of the factors which control the ER effect on a molecular scale
              and lead to better understanding of the ER phenomenon. The fluids described are
              inherently superior to traditional two phase electrorheological fluids. 
    
              Applications in shock dampening, robotic actuators, temperature resistant
              lubricants and fluid damping are examples of some of the commercial sectors
              where electrorheological fluids will be applied. These fluids can be
              incorporated into a myriad of products ranging from the emerging robotics
              market to heavy machinery.
