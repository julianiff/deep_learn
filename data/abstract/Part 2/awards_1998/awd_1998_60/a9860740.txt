Abstract    :
              9860740
      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project
              aims to develop a new approach for the growth of CdGeAs2 single crystals.
              CdGeAs2 has outstanding optical nonlinear properties. Its nonlinear optical
              coefficient is the highest among all known crystals, it is transmissive from
              2-3 to 18 um and it has a relatively high thermal conductivity. It is
              therefore, a material of choice for the generation of tunable laser radiation
              in the infrared. Although the optical transmission of CdGeAs2 can be improved
              by after-growth treatments, we propose to grow CdGeAs2 single crystals by the
              Czochralski technique to achieve high uniformity and optical transmission in
              the as-grown state.
     High quality and lower cost CdGeAs2 single crystals
              will make possible powerful infrared laser sources tunable from 4 to 11 um.
              Such sources will have numerous commercial applications including defense
              countermeasure systems, communication systems, remote sensing of contaminants
              in the atmosphere and infrared spectroscopy.
