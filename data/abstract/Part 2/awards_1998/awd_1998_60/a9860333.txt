Abstract    :
              9860333
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
              the most challenging, and still largely unsolved, aspect of chemical detection
              - the accurate resolution of individual species in real-world samples. Several
              important types of sensing instrumentation approach chemical-specificity by
              utilizing large arrays of relatively non-specific polymer-coated sensors.
              Synthesis of specialized polymers for such sensors is expensive,
              time-consuming, and limited to certain classes of polymer materials. There is a
              strong need for coatings exhibiting a higher degree of molecular recognition
              which can be fabricated in a simple, cost-effective process. Such coatings
              permit construction of highly specific arrays using a minimum number of
              sensors. Physical Sciences, Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop sensor coatings
              whose chemical specificity can be precisely tuned, and which are
              self-transducing. In Phase I this concept will be demonstrated by the
              construction and testing of a model sensor array. The results of these tests
              will then be used to construct a demonstration device for the detection of
              organophosphate pesticides in the presence of chemically similar
              interferents.
     These proposed coatings and coating process will improve
              the performance of virtually all polymer-based sensing instrumentation in
              demanding environments. Areas of application include environmental monitoring
              of toxic gases and quality control for fragrances and foodstuffs.
