Abstract    :
              9860997
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will merge
              MPI Software Technology, Inc.'s unparalleled MPI implementation experience with
              a scientific analysis of the entire MPI 2 standard.  This analysis will examine
              each major functionality subsystem of MPI 2 as well as the interactions among
              these. This analysis will guide innovations in scalable and dynamic process
              startup in heterogeneous environments, and in advanced algorithmic and
              poly-algorithmic approaches to one sided communication, collective operations,
              and parallel I/O.  This research shall be accomplished in order to create a
              quality design of the MPI 2 Standard from first principles, targeting a
              far-reaching range of present and future systems including NOWs and MPPs.  
              Also, a prototype of key elements of MPI 2 will serve as a basis for providing
              the scientific, research, business, and other communities with a quality
              implementation of MPI 2.
     Small to medium enterprises worldwide, as well
              as academics and large industries that need to perform scientific and
              engineering computations, can benefit from cost effective, high performance
              clusters plus MPI.  Data mining database computations, crash test codes, and
              semi- commercial academic codes have commercial relevance.  The waning of
              supercomputer cycle access for scientists has increased the importance of high
              quality software to harness clusters of cost-effective workstations/PCs and
              emerging gigabit networks.
