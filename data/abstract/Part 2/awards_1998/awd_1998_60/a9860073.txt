Abstract    :
              9860073
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Nanosonic Inc. will develop electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) processes for the
              fabrication of advanced microelectronic devices, large-area light-emitting
              display devices and arrays, and high conductivity interconnecting thin films,
              for widespread commercial use in electronics, communications, instrumentation
              and computer systems.  Revolutionary ESA methods to create nanostructured
              multi-layer inorganic/organic thin-films using low-cost water-based chemistry
              offer major advantages over conventional microelectronics manufacturing
              processes, because devices may be designed, and bandgaps controlled, at the
              molecular level.  Furthermore, the process is simple and
              environmentally-friendly.  The feasibility of ESA processing to create
              functional microelectronic photonic thin film devices, specifically
              polymer-based LEDs, will be investigated in Phase I.  Nanosonic Inc. will
              capitalize upon research advances generated in the VPI Fiber and Electro-Optics
              Research Center.
