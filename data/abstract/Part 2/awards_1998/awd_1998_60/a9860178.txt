Abstract    :
              9860178
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test
              the feasibility of applying a novel statistical absorption tomography technique
              to retrieve local properties from path integrated measurements made in
              turbulent flows. Tomographic techniques are widely used in the medical field,
              but are restricted to time-invariant phenomena, such as laminar flows or
              stationary objects. There are two distinguishing features of the proposed high
              resolution statistical tomography that will be demonstrated during the Phase I
              research effort: (1) a statistical deconvolution technique which will determine
              the local Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of specific absorption
              coeffcient with the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to characterize
              turbulent flows, and (2) a laser sheet/diode array system which has the
              capability to obtain the high resolution measurements required for the
              statistical tomographic technique.
     Local PDFs of specific absorption
              coefficients are required for non-intrusive monitoring of the particulate and
              gas species concentrations in a wide variety of turbulent flows. Specific
              applications include pollution control in smoke stacks, process control in
              power plants, stability control in gas turbine engine premixers, and
              manufacturing control in metal and ceramic powder processing. The proposed
              technology is designed to provide a new process monitoring tool for particulate
              and gas species concentrations in industrial flows and has immediate commercial
              utility in the power plant, powder processing and gas turbine industries.
