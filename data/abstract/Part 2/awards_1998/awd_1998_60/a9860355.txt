Abstract    :
              9860355
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              innovate an In-Bed Exerciser (IBEX). The objective is to restore and/or prevent
              the loss of functional mobility in bedridden-elderly patients. Functional
              mobility loss in the elderly often results from rapid muscular atrophy of the
              thigh and leg muscles during prolonged bed-rest. Decreased functional mobility
              has a drastic effect on quality of life and has been found to significantly
              predict mortality.  Bedridden-elderly patients depend on physical therapists to
              provide appropriate exercise at bedside in sessions that are often too
              infrequent to maintain or rehabilitate deconditioned thigh and leg muscles.
              Furthermore, physical therapists are unable to sustain sufficient force and
              intensity to exercise the thigh and leg muscles adequately.  Phase I research
              consists of the design, construction and pilot testing with bedridden patients
              of a second-generation prototype. The research objectives are to demonstrate
              the feasibility and safety of IBEX for Phase II clinical trials.
     The
              estimated total market of 300,000 Americans is currently served at a cost of
              $1.4 billion. IBEX will reduce these health care costs by both maintaining and
              restoring the functional mobility of bedridden patients. IBEX will be used in
              hospitals, nursing homes and home care settings.
