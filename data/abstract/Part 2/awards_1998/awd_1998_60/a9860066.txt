Abstract    :
              9860066
     The proposed research effort will address current constraints that
              severely limit the usability and ease of use of biological databases and
              information servers. The proposed prototype will provide seamless integration
              of major biological databases and analytical tools. While the Phase I effort
              will focus on Protein structure related databases and tools, the framework to
              be developed will find extentive applications in many other fields. The
              framework will include multi-path learning modules on effective utilization of
              such a seamless access to diverse databases and tools. Guided utilization
              tours, featuring relevant case-study examples will be incorporated to provide
              experienced researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities
              of the emerging field of bioinformatics and how such tools may be integrated
              into traditional "wet" laboratories.
     CD-ROM integrated "guided discovery
              and effective utilization" systems for Protein structure related information
              servers will be developed and marketed.
