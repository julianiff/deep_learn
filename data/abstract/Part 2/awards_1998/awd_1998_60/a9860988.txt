Abstract    :
              9860988
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              directed the use a combination of cross-linked enzyme crystal (CLEC(R))
              technology and chemical modification to prepare a stable and active biocatalyst
              for antibiotic synthesis. Beta-lactam antibiotic manufacturing processes are
              comprised of multiple protection, deprotection and stoichiometric activation
              steps, generating 100 to 1000 fold more waste than product. Moreover, energy
              consumption is high since many of the steps must be performed at ultra-low
              temperatures. Altus Biologics is a world leader in biocatalysis; developing
              cross-linked enzyme crystal (CLEC(R)) technology for the stabilization of
              protein catalysts. Development of a form of Penicillin acylase that is active
              and stable in aqueous/organic solvent mixtures will allow the exploitation of
              the exquisite selectivity of this enzyme for catalyzing a one-step antibiotic
              coupling. Optimization of catalyst activity and stability in high
              concentrations of reactants and solvent mixtures will be performed through
              iterative chemical modification and cross-linking.
     Development of a
              stable and active biocatalyst will allow the economic manufacture of
              high-volume pharmaceuticals via an efficient and environ-mentally benign
              process.
