Abstract    :
              9860120
     This SBIR Phase I project is aimed at developing a rapid,
              automated method to select hybridoma cells from a heterogeneous population
              using agarose gel microencapsulation technology and flow cytometry. Individual
              hybridoma cells will be encapsulated into agarose gel microdrops (GMDs) that
              have a protein antigen anchored to the agarose matrix, allowing the protein
              antigen to function as the capture molecule. Hybridoma secreted antibodies that
              interact with the anchored protein antigen will be detected with a
              fluorescently labeled anti-IgG antibody within the GMD, permitting isolation of
              hybridomas by fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the affinity
              of the secreted antibodies for the protein antigen. GMD-containing displaying a
              high degree of fluorescence will be sorted, pooled, cultured, and subsequently
              screened in a second pass of the selection assay. The end result will be
              hybridoma cells secreting high affinity antibodies directed towards the desired
              protein antigen. Current methods for screening hybridoma cells are labor
              intensive, costly, and unreliable.
      Development of a rapid, automated
              method to isolate specific or high antibody producing hybridoma cells of
              interest would find broad application in the large scale production of many
              genetically engineered proteins for therapeutic or human in vitro diagnostic
              use.
