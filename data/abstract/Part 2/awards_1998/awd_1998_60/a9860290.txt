Abstract    :
              9860290                           
     This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will develop a new technology to make uniform polystyrene
              coated iron particles for bio-magnetic separations. Bio-magnetic separations
              are an emerging technology using magnetism, sometimes with conventional
              separations or identification methods, to purify cells, proteins and nucleic
              acids. They are increasingly appealing due to their scalability, efficiency,
              simplicity, mild conditions, ease of automation, and low cost. However, current
              methods that make polymers first followed by attempts to engulf ultra-fine
              magnetite (e.g. y-Fe304) or ferrite (e.g. y-Fe203) into the polymeric colloidal
              particles are not efficient, or effective. As a result, the final product has
              low magnetite or ferrite content hence low efficiency in bio-magnetic
              separation. At the same time, there are few suppliers, some products have poor
              quality, and there is little selectivity in terms of size of the beads and
              surface chemistry of the beads. In this Phase I effort, MMI proposes to
              synthesize nanoscale Fe styrene colloidal solutions by the solvated metal atoms
              dispersion (SMAD) method, followed by polymerizing styrene. The
              polystyrene-coated iron particles are expected to be superparamagnetic and have
              superior properties in bio-magnetic separations after proper surface
              modification.
     There are many applications for the polystyrene coated iron
              particles, such as cell separation, immunoassays, latex agglutination, cell
              tags, blood flow markers, chromatographic assays, blood cell stimulation,
              magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, micro-carriers in cell culture, DNA
              probes/PCR.
