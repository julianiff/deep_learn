Abstract    :
              9860607
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop thin-film NOX sensors based on novel binary-phased nanocomposites by
              sol-gel processing. Such sensors are expected to show greatly (non-additively)
              enhanced sensitivity to both NO and NO2, while interference from other gases
              may be minimized. The long-term stability of the sensor performance may also be
              improved due to the increased stability of the sensing materials in the
              binary-phased structure. Sol-gel offers many advantages as a processing
              technique for sensor fabrication, which include, in particular, the facility
              and versatility for nanoengineering of the microstructure. These thin-film
              sensors can be readily incorporated with silicon micro-electronic technology
              and naturally allow for miniaturization, low process costs, and high
              reproducibility.
     Reliable compact solid-state chemical sensors are
              urgently needed. This innovation is expected to result in highly stable and
              sensitive thin-film NOx sensors for automotive emission control, industrial
              processing control, and environmental monitoring. These sensors may be used as
              standalone sensing devices or as sensing units to be integrated into on-chip
              multi-functional sensors and smart structures.
