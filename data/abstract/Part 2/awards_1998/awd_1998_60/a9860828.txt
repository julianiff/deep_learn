Abstract    :
              9860828
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes
              new technology for an on-line mass spectrometer that offers a compelling
              performance and price breakthrough relative to existing technology used to
              monitor and control microelectronic manufacturing processes. The basic
              techniques are threshold photoionization (TPI) coupled to a quadruple ion
              trap/mass spectrometer. The TPI energy is sufficiently high to also ionize
              nearly all compounds of manufacturing interest (e.g., organics, amines, amides,
              phosphines, arsines, some si-lanes, and most heteroatom containing molecules)
              yet it is of sufficiently low energy to avoid fragmerttation of these molecules
              and to avoid ionization of common atmospheric constituents such as N2, 2, H20,
              CO2, CO, Ar, and other rare gases that are not directly involved in
              manufacturing processes. These at-tributes permit enormous simplification in
              the analysis of complex mixtures compared to currently available mass
              spectrometers. Based on previous research conducted in our laboratories and on
              a validated model for calculating ion production rates, we project detection
              sensitivity of <1 part-per-billion with 1 sec response time. This work builds
              on fundamental developments and commercial customers and third party financing
              have been identified to commercialize this technology.
     The proposed
              instrument is a universal ultra-sensitive real-time monitoring system whose
              applications are broad. Syagen is focusing on three market areas:  (1)
              microelectronics and other manufacturing process monitoring (e.g., endpoint
              detection), (2) rapid monitoring of explosives or contraband in airline
              baggage, mail packages, or motor vehicles, and (3) monitoring of pollution for
              regulatory compliance and process efficiency, (e.g., in-field air, water, soil
              assaying, automobile or truck exhaust, refinery emission, etc.).
