Abstract    :
              9860630
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the
              ultimate goal of developing prototype software that meets the following
              requirements: converts polygonal meshs to Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines
              (NURBS); provides adjustable trade-offs between fit to data, smoothness, and
              storage size; is fast and affordable; and can be integrated with the software
              currently being developed under an earlier NSF SBIR Phase I award. There are
              four key research objectives:  (1)to develop software to determine suitable
              Morse functions, to identify the critical points of a given Morse function, and
              to determine the type of critical point (two circles coalescing into one, a
              circle collapsing to a point, a circle emerging from a point); (2) to develop
              software that systematically decomposes each cylindrical piece into different
              polygonal meshes to which NURBS patches can be fit; ( 3) to demonstrate the
              utility of using a neural network preprocessor to initialize the NURBS
              parameters for the optimization process; and (4) to develop an understanding of
              the continuity constraints and how they impact both the neural network training
              and the resulting constrained optimization problem.
     The area of 3D
              medical imaging is one of great interest in the scientific community today.
              Significant improvements in 2D medical imaging (CT, MRI, PET, The Visible Human
              Project, etc.) and the amazing advances in computer hardware have made the
              presentation of complicated anatomical 3D images in real time (QTVR format, and
              animations) a reality. Many companies are trying to take advantage of these
              advances to produce diagnostic tools, medical teaching materials and
              interactive simulators. Software for converting polygon models into NURBS that
              is easy to use, and is fast and efficient, can yield time savings of great
              value to those firms.
