Abstract    :
              9860404
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              proposes a novel physical vapor deposition (PVD) alternative to conventional
              electroplating used in depositing relatively thick functional metal coatings.
              Electroplating operations are known to generate large quantities of hazardous
              waste and toxic fumes.  The PVD approach will obviate the use of liquid
              chemicals, recycle solid metals in situ, and leave no emissions.  The concept
              is a non-line-of-site deposition of metals at high rates, which will allow the
              growth of relatively thick (greater than 10 microns) and uniform deposits of
              metals on three-dimensional objects simultaneously from all sides.  In this
              way, it may be possible to deposit a large number of small objects or a small
              number of large objects in a relatively short period.  Phase I will explore the
              effect of process parameters on degrading inclusions in the growing film and
              the integrity of such thick films.  Process modeling, using the statistical
              design of experiments, will be performed.
     Chrome, copper, nickel, and
              other relatively thick coatings are extensively used in the defense,
              electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries.  It is anticipated that high
              quality, thick functional metal coatings will be deposited in an
              environmentally safe manner.
