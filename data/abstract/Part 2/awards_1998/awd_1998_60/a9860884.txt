Abstract    :
              9860884
     Emission control requirements imposed on the automobile industry
              by state and federal governments continue to become more stringent. Oxygen
              sensors are currently used to control the air/fuel ratio and to monitor
              emission control systems in internal combustion engines but have limited
              capabilities. Further reduction of emissions will require diagnostic systems
              that correctly identify faults by detection of all gases present in the
              exhaust. Existing sensors that can measure exhaust gases of interest are
              expensive and were not designed to operate at high exhaust temperatures.
              Therefore, improved high-temperature gas sensors are needed for next generation
              vehicles. The proposed work will investigate the feasibility of using a
              wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor system to monitor exhaust gases. A
              wireless system has the potential for high performance with low weight and cost
              due the elimination of a wiring harness. The Phase I work will focus on the
              development of a wireless water vapor sensing system to demonstrate the
              feasibility of high temperature and wireless measurements of gas
              concentrations. Sensors for the exhaust gases of interest will be developed in
              Phase II. This wireless system also has potential as a replacement for existing
              climate control and other sensing functions such as: engine temperature,
              manifold and tire pressure, ABS, and speed control.
