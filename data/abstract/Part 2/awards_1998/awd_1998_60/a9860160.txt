Abstract    :
              9860160
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will show
              the feasibility of new technology that will allow the fabrication of silicon
              avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays which can be used for x-ray, charged
              particle, and optical imaging with improved quantum efficiency at the deep red
              end of the spectrum (i.e., >60% at 1, um) and at the violet end of the
              spectrum. The proposed design is based on a modified reach through structure.
              Improvements for charged particles and photons at the violet end of the
              spectrum will come from using a new ultra-shallow junction technology.
              Improvements for x-rays and photons at the deep red end of the spectrum will
              come from improved configuration and n-type Si with ultra-high resistivity and
              excellent minority carrier lifetime. Improvements in noise and pixel isolation
              will come from new technology for junction edge passivation. Improvements in
              avalanche gain and gain uniformity will come from improved techniques for
              fabricating the avalanche zone. In Phase I, we expect to prove feasibility by
              showing that we can maintain the required properties of the n-type Si and by
              demonstrating that we can provide surface passivation adequate for acceptable
              pixel isolation.
     There are many commercial and potential commercial
              markets for Si APDs and APD arrays ranging from simple laser detection, through
              replacement of photo multiplier tubes for scintillation detectors, to low
              energy x-ray detection and spectroscopy. A technology which improves the
              spectral coverage and makes extended arrays possible will heavily impact
              existing markets as well as creating new market potential.
