Abstract    :
              9860867
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a multi-component mid-infrared analyzer system which includes an
              innovative in-situ internal reflection probe with a flexible coupling to an
              infrared spectrometer.  The probe will sample multiple components in the
              fermentation broth of a bioreactor via evanescent field interaction in an
              attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal element. The infrared light
              throughout of flexible coupling elements is higher than conventional,
              halcogenide infrared fibers and the elements are mechanically more robust. The
              analyzer also contains a self-cleaning filter mechanism to prevent biofouling
              of the active probe surface. In the Phase I effort, the analyzer will monitor
              glycerol and acetate concentrations in a bioreactor system with a one  minute
              total measurement cycle time and sensitivity down to 1 g/l range.  The Infrared
              analyzer system will find commercial applications in bioreactor systems used in
              the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and food Industries. The analyzer will
              provide improved process control and efficiency in these industries.
     The
              proposed in situ infrared multiple component analyzer will provide a valuable
              process control and diagnostics tool for use in bioreactors in the
              biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and food industries.  It will also find
              applications in the petroleum and chemical feedstock Industries.
