Abstract    :
              9860356
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I peoject will
              investigate the development of an organic electroluminescent display enhanced
              by a cholesteric liquid crystal resonant cavity.  Organic light emitting
              materials have sufficient brightness, color purity, and operating lifetime to
              make them a possible low-cost alternative to the dominant flat panel display
              technologies.  Resonant cavities are able to enhance the mission or absorption
              efficiency of electro-optical devices.  The self-assembly characteristics of
              cholesteric liquid crystals could greatly simplify the LCD manufacturing
              process.                                                                       
                       In this Phase I activity, Reveo will identify and evaluate the
              electroluminescent and cholesteric liquid crystal component materials and
              assess the feasibility of two possible innovative organic electroluminescent
              display designs for brightness, color purity and operating lifetimes.
