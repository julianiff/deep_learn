Abstract    :
              9860704
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-I project seeks to
              develop "uncopier" units to do "at source deinking of one sheet at a time".
              Uncopiers will seamlessly extend the capabilities of copiers to remove
              laser-xerographic ink from waste letter or legal sheets. ACIM-assisted
              deinking, i.e. precisely controlled acoustic microcavitation, uses only SILENT
              SOUND and CLEAN WATER. It is energy efficient, chemical free, and virtually
              spontaneous; it leaves paper fibers immaculate and undamaged. Deinking of paper
              prior to recycling increases its furnished value and protects confidentiality.
              The goal of this Phase-I research is to prove the feasibility of  de-inking.
              ACIM-assisted de-inking.
     Presently recycling is done by pulp deinking; no
              one has attempted "at source deinking of one sheet at a time". The "uncopier"
              will provide expedient and efficient deinking for paper recycling needs well
              into the 21st century. Today, 7 million copiers are in use across the US and
              1.5 million new copier units are sold each year. Over 12 million tons of scrap
              paper are generated each year by office workers in the US or the equivalent of
              135 sheet of paper per employee per day-which the "uncopier" will effortlessly
              de-ink.
