Abstract    :
              9860391
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposed
              by Krispin Technologies Inc. will explore the novel concept of improving
              organic Rankine cycle engines (ORCEs) by exploiting unusual fluid dynamic
              behavior described by a relatively new area of science known as "dense gas
              dynamics." ORCEs are currently being manufactured and used for numerous remote
              terrestrial applications requiring reliable, unattended power. One of the major
              loss mechanisms in ORCEs is due to shock waves generated in the turbine stage.
              Utilizing a "dense gas" working fluid to weaken or eliminate the shocks can
              potentially reduce such losses. Preliminary results by the Principal
              Investigator show very significant improvements in turbine efficiencies for
              dense gas working fluids over conventional ORCE working fluids. The proposed
              Phase I work consists of a computational parametric study to determine the
              optimal turbine stage design. Based on these findings, phase II work would then
              involve building and testing a prototype engine to determine actual performance
              improvements. 
     The potential improvements to ORCEs anticipated through
              this research and development will result in an efficient power generation
              technology that would represent a major breakthrough in the commercial
              turbomachinery industry and could have significant, positive economic and
              environmental impacts in energy production.
