Abstract    :
              98600122
	Humankind's dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in environmental
              stresses and negative consequences at local, regional, and global levels.  It
              is important for students to have an understanding of the processes involved in
              pollution transport, concentrations, and depletion.  This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase I project from Global Positions, LLC proposes an
              Internet-based software tool, the Internet-Based Geographical Pollution
              Prediction Simulator (IGPPS), that will allow students to investigate the
              spatial distribution and concentrations of air pollution, through dynamic
              simulation, modeling and visualization.  The research will utilize an
              EPA-approved air dispersion model, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              coupled with the Internet to afford synergistic benefits, including a capacity
              to view complex pollution patterns and the provisions of a better understanding
              of the dynamics of air pollution, through dynamic exploration.  This tool will
              provide an understanding of existing situations as well as provide mechanisms
              for predicting the outcome of future scenarios.
	Ecological factors are
              playing a greater role in planning and decision processes of communities and
              will continue to grow in significance.  In this context, the proffered
              internet-based simulator of airborne pollution dispersion, which promises to be
              easy to use, inexpensive, and promote enhanced student learning of pollution
              modeling through virtual experimentation and visualization, represents a
              valuable contribution.  It has the potential to be widely used in classrooms on
              many subjects, including geography, cartography, environmental studies,
              industrial and other fields of engineering, and city planning, and integrated
              into a number of different curricula.
