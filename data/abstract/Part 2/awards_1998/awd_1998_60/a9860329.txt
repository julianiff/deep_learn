Abstract    :
              9860329
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop and qualify an inexpensive, visible light audio information transfer
              system (VLAITS) that transmits data to a personal audio receiver (PAR) used to
              convey information to visually and hearing impaired users. The concept to
              frequency modulate light from existing lighting fixtures in buildings to carry
              data and information with no disruption of their lighting function will be
              refined. The PAR will be developed to receive and present audio information.
              The system will be developed in collaboration with, then tested and evaluated
              by, experts on the rehabilitation of visually and hearing impaired persons to
              maximize user friendliness and value.
     As a result of this project, a new
              inexpensive broad scale assistive technology will be developed. VLAITS will be
              of great benefit in expanding the accessibility of buildings and facilities to
              visually and hearing impaired persons, particularly in a cost conscious
              environment.
