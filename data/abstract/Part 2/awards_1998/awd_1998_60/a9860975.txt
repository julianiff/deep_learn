Abstract    :
              9860975
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              investigates an instrument sensitive enough to compete with water vapor
              measurements made by much larger, more complex equipment, but cheap enough to
              be a "throw away" device.   Unlike current infrared instruments, which are
              assembled from many separate components, it features a highly integrated
              "sensor on a chip" employing advanced surface modification technology and
              capitalizing on modem semiconductor fabrication methods.  This new, integrated
              approach replaces discrete component instruments in much the same way
              integrated circuits have superseded distributed elements in electronic systems.
               In addition to the potential for serving an important role in atmospheric
              research, the proposed device is a step toward next generation gas sensors for
              environmental and industrial monitoring.
     This device is expected to be a
              simple, low cost, light weight alternative to conventional infrared absorption
              instruments.   By reducing weight, complexity, and cost, it opens applications
              beyond the reach of current infrared instruments, such as the next generation
              gas sensors for indoor air quality, environmental research, and industrial
              controls.
