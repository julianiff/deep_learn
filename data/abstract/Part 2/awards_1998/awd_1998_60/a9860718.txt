Abstract    :
              9860718
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate materials and techniques for ultraviolet (UV) wavelength
              generation. The material periodically poled lithium tantalate (PPLT) will be
              used in the range 300-400 nm, and reduction of the absorption near its UV band
              edge will be investigated to obtain wavelengths <300 nm.  For deeper UV
              periodic twinning of quartz will be investigated. With this material, frequency
              conversion of Nd: YAG lasers through the sixth harmonic at 177 nm is possible.
              Together these patterned materials to the important but difficult UV range. The
              long-range goal is to develop sources operating in the spectral range <400 nm.
              Low power devices ~10 mW are suitable for some applications; however, the goal
              is to develop output powers of 100 mW - 1 W. To this end, two approaches will
              be pursued: improve the basic material and develop device configurations that
              extend the power range of current materials. Treatments of PPLT to lower its
              absorption will be studied. Double-pass second harmonic generation by using
              quasi-phase-matching to properly phase the multiple passes will also be
              demonstrated.
     The solid-state UV laser sources being developed in this
              program will lead to applications in sensors, biomedical instrumentation,
              stereolithography, semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and photochemistry.
              The combination of cw-diode-pumped lasers and periodically patterned materials
              will form a robust and efficient commercial product. As a first step down the
              path of commercialization, a pulsed tunable visible/UV source will be
              demonstrated on this program.
