Abstract    :
              9860502
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I Project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of producing highly conducting wires by extrusion
              of polymers filled with nanoparticles of silver and copper.  Working with our
              collaborators at Fraunhofer Resource Center-Delaware (FRC-DE), we have made
              advances in filled polymers in a new direction by incorporating metallic micron
              size fillers that are aggregates of nansocale (~50 nm) particles.  Such a
              unique morphology of the filler material enables reduction of the percolation
              threshold to below 10 vol.%, which is much lower than the percolation threshold
              in conventional fillers.  High conductivity, combined with good mechanical
              properties were achieved in polymer matrix tapes as a result of this novel
              polymer-metal nanocomposite structure.  In Phase I of the project, we will
              fabricate polymer nanocomposite wires with high room temperature electrical
              conductivity, modulus and tensile strength.  The Phase II program will consist
              of optimizing the properties, building a prototype continuous production unit,
              establishing production protocols, and working closely with end-user companies.
               Large-scale production will be undertaken in Phase III.
     There is a need
              to produce filled polymers that have low density, high electrical conductivity,
              high modulus and tensile strength.  Our unique method of incorporating micron
              size porous fillers consisting of aggregated nanoscale particles is a solution
              to the problem.  The new material is a potential replacement for the heavier
              metallic wires, can be used as conducting tapes and adhesives, and so large
              markets can be addressed.
