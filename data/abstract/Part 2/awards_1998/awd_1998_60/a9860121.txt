Abstract    :
              9860121
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for
              research to develop an optical measuring device for simultaneously measuring
              the deflection basin caused by application of a heavy test wheel on standard
              road pavement and the pavement surface profile. The device is based on the laws
              of geometrical optics to measure the small deflections from a load wheel. The
              system relies on strong, monochromatic light sources from lasers and has the
              theoretical capability of accurately measuring deflections in the range of 5 to
              30+ mils. Major advantages are:  (1) the device has no moving parts; and (2) it
              measures the entire deflection basin while moving continuously at around10 mph.
              The proposed tests will evaluate its capability under realistic, but controlled
              conditions, using real pavement to evaluate its effectiveness on the variable
              surface conditions found on typical pavement. The optical deflectometer will be
              carefully tested and verified for accuracy in measuring deflections over the
              range of deflection expected in testing real pavements while moving over the
              surface. These tests include digital data recording of laboratory and
              simplified field data across the width of the deflection basin. 
     This
              system will increase the efficiency of pavement maintenance inspection by a
              factor of four or five. It will measure the entire deflection basin, rather
              than the single point measurements obtained by today's equipment and
              simultaneously the pavement surface profile. This system will be highly
              desirable to all government and private agencies, both domestic, and foreign,
              who are responsible for pavement maintenance.
