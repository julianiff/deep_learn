Abstract    :
              9860041
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              develop low-cost, high-performance, tunable solid-state dye lasers using liquid
              crystalline polymer as a distributed-feedback host. The proposed lasers are
              surface-emitting with a polarized narrowband emission from UV to infrared.
              These lasers are of simple construction, extremely compact and
              opto-mechanically robust. Being solid-state, these lasers are
environmentally
              safe and user-friendly.  Preliminary results have demonstrated that these
              solid-state dye lasers are feasible. Low-threshold, circularly polarized laser
              emission with narrow spectral bandwidth has been observed. In Phase I, these
              novel lasers will be systematically studied with the goal of defining optimal
              designs. Viable fabrication processes for these thin-film dye lasers will also
              be developed. In Phase II, optimized prototype laser systems will be designed,
              constructed and field-tested. These prototypes will lead to commercial products
              for portable applications beyond the laboratory environment. Envisioned system
              sizes are about 5 cm x 5 cm x 15 cm, 99% of which is occupied by the pump
              laser. If a semiconductor diode laser as a pump source is used, system with IR
              output would be dramatically reduced in size. 
     Compact solid-state
              tunable dye lasers have diverse applications. For example, they can be used in
              field to monitor chemical and biological hazards and monitor air pollution.
              Other applications include secured optical communications, target designation,
              biomedical diagnostics, optical mass data storage and high-brightness
              information displays.
