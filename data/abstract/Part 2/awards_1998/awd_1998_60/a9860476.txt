Abstract    :
              9860476
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes
              the design and mechanical development of a Dexterous Manipulator System (DMS),
              a telerobotic manipulator for use in microsurgical applications. Normal human
              hand motion possesses numerous position error components, such as physiological
              hand tremor, jerk, and low frequency wander. In microsurgery, such involuntary
              hand motion hampers performance, particularly in the ophthalmomlogical and
              neurological fields. Presently, surgeons cannot operate on individual blood
              vessels of the retina owing to such motion. The proposed robotic arm will
              alleviate the effect of physiological tremor, enhancing precision and enabling
              more difficult surgeries. The DMS is a mechanical robot wrist joint with up to
              180 degrees of singularity-free pitch and yaw motion about a two-axis center.
              Acting like a double ball-and-socket joint, 180 degrees of hemispherical range
              of motion is achieved by phasing two joints together. Zero backlash is achieved
              by a unique, patent-pending, repeated linkage, parallel architecture that
              obviates gears and cable systems. An articulated arm carries the wrist for
              positioning which is driven by a unique parallelogram linkage. The proposed
              patent pending Dexterous Manipulator System revolutionizes surgical procedures
              permitting greater-than-human precision and dexterity. Not only will current
              procedures be improved, but new procedures will be made possible as well.
    
              There are 2,000,000 cataract operations and 300,000 vitreous procedures that
              are performed yearly in the U.S.  Market potential for this technology includes
              all operating rooms performing micro-surgery. Non-surgical applications include
              semiconductor wafer handling, crystallography, and other applications requiring
              micro-manipulation.
