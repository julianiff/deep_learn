Abstract    :
              9860774
      This Small Business Innovation Research (sbir) Phase I project
              will evaluate a fluoride crystalline material; NaYF4 (NYF) as a host for laser
              diode pumped laser. Nd:NYF has superior spectroscopic properties to Nd:YLF and
              Nd:YAG, crystals that are widely used in commercial laser diode-pumped lasers
              and has comparable properties to Nd: YVO4, a material more efficient than
              either YAG or YLF. When a combination of Yb and Er dopants are incorporated to
              NYF, this material shows great promise for an upconversion phosphor. AC
              Materials Inc. proposes to develop enabling technology for production of high
              optical quality NYF crystals for laser applications. AC Materials has conceived
              an innovative approach to grow uniformly doped single crystals of
              non-stoichiometric fluoride materials. The Phase I program will involve growth
              of single crystals also by the Top-Seeded Solution Growth technique, which will
              produce samples of enough size and quality for laser evaluation. Material
              properties that are relevant to the application of NYF as a laser will also be
              measured. Production of granular rare-earth doped NYF will enable its
              evaluation as a phosphor material.
     The commercial market of this material
              is two fold: for a replacement material used as the bases for diode pumped
              lasers and displays. During Phase I, the proposer will work with OEM
              manufactures to incorporate this material into their products. This material
              shows great promise to replace current materials used in the industry.
