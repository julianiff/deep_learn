Abstract    :
              9860186
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  will develop a
              whole wafer sensor for in situ measurements of temperature, emissivity and film
              stack properties, from a model-based analysis of thermal radiance images. 
              Exploiting commercial infrared imaging hardware, the proposed compact system
              will provide high performance measurement capability from a single small
              infrared window with optical access to the wafer surface.  Temperature
              monitoring has been identified as an important hurdle blocking future process
              enhancements in semiconductor manufacturing.  Improved in situ diagnostics for
              substrate temperature, emissivity and film properties will incur many benefits
              inclunding improved quality and to optimize process process efficiency, reduced
              scrap and cost and reduced time parameters.
