Abstract    :
              9860785
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop visible fiber lasers and amplifiers.  The advantages of these devices
              include very high efficiencies, high gain, direct diode laser pumping, high
              spatial mode quality, room temperature operation, and the fiber geometry
              inherently avoids thermal problems.  The project will leverage research on
              energy transfer between rare-earth ions in low phonon energy glasses,
              color-center formation in crystalline hosts, and diode-pumped solid state
              lasers.  A chemically stable, high power, continuous wave visible laser will be
              developed.  There are a broad range of applications for visible fiber lasers
              and amplifiers, including multi-color displays and printing.
