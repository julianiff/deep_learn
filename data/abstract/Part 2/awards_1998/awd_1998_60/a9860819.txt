Abstract    :
              9860819

     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              conduct theoretical research and develop a prototype software tool (COMPEL) for
              stimulating strategic behavior of generating companies in competitive power
              markets. We will use the Klemperer-Meyer Supply Function Equilibria (SFE)
              theory; which has been applied to power markets in England (Green and Newbery)
              and in the U.S. (Rudkevich et al).                           
     The U.S.
              electric industry is being deregulated in many states. In deregulated markets,
              prices will be set by market-forces and generating companies will have to
              compete for market share and revenues. Existing decision support tools,
              designed for regulated markets and based on least-cost optimization approaches,
              will not be suitable to simulate the operation of deregulated markets because
              they do not accurately capture the impacts of competition. COMPEL will be such
              a tool.
The objectives of this Phase I project are to advance the application
              of the SFE theory in modeling strategic behavior of sellers in competitive
              generation markets and to develop prototype software for easy application of
              this theory.
     Prospective users of COMPEL include regulatory agencies,
              power buyers, generating companies, financial institutions, researchers and
              consulting companies. Potential commercial applications are enormous.
