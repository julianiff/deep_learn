Abstract    :
              9860390
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a new ceramic cutting tool material for machining titanium alloys.
               Only limited success has been achieved by new coatings to prevent dissolution
              of carbon from current tungsten carbide tools into titanium.  Phase I will
              develop a new class of ceramic-composite cutting tools based on
              yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG), whose mechanical properties are similar to those
              of alumina and which are more compatible chemically with titanium.  The
              research will make an initial thermodynamic phase compatibility analysis of
              reinforced YAG composites with titanium, experiment with YAG-based composite
              processing, characterize reactions occurring at the ceramic-titanium interface,
              and evaluate key mechanical properties.
     Titanium alloys, widely used in
              the aerospace industry, are one of the most difficult workpieces to machine. 
              Their high reactivity limits the use of state-of-the-art ceramic tools.  A new 
              YAG-based, ceramic-composite cutting tool could reduce the costs of titanium
              alloy products by increasing machining rates and reducing production time.
