Abstract    :
              9860949
     This Small business Innovation Research Phase I project involves
              the development of an improved catalytic reactor based on a novel catalyst
              substrate design for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of carbon monoxide in a
              hydrogen rich feed. The proposed work will demonstrate the viability of this
              catalyst substrate for substantial reductions in the size, weight and cost of
              the PROX component and also identify parameters for designing a full-scale PROX
              reactor. Subsequent phases will focus on catalyst optimization and integration
              of a PROX reactor based on the catalyst substrate in a fuel processor system
              for automotive fuel cell applications.
     This potential breakthrough could
              significantly advance fuel processing technology for automotive fuel cell
              applications. The proposed technology has the potential to provide near-order
              of magnitude improvements in fuel processor volume, weight and cost, with a
              broad range of potential spin off applications to other catalytic reactors.
              Success with the PROX reactor would lead to exploring use of this substrate for
              other components in the fuel processor, including the reformer and the Water
              Gas Shift reactors.
