Abstract    :
              9860212
     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will evaluate a blind structural fastening technique that is thought to be
              superior to riveted joints.  Riveting is the preferred method for assembly of
              load-bearing aluminum and titanium airframe structures; however, this process
              requires high loads and access to both sides of the structure.  Phase I will
              analyze and test the mechanical performance of a low-impact fastener inflation
              approach for structural joining.  This approach  requires access to only one
              side of a structure, greatly simplifying fastener installation.  The Phase I
              project will perform:  numerical analysis of the mechanics of fastener
              installation; an experiment to verify fastener loads and deformation; and test
              the strength of fastened test coupons.  Design specifications will be made for
              a low-cost fastener and a compact, low-impact-fastening tool suited for manual
              or robotic installation.
     Airframe assembly is a major cost of military
              and commercial aircraft.  This fastener technology is expected to halve the
              cost of manual airframe fabrication and can be used in an automated,
              flexible-manufacturing environment.  It may eventually be extended to fastening
              of a wide variety of aluminum, titanium, and composite structures for
              automotive, transport, and civil engineering structures.
