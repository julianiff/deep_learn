Abstract    :
              9860909
     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore development of a 2000-degree Centigrade (C) heating element. 
              Current technology only supports 1850/1900-degree C heating elements. The main
              technical barriers preventing a 2000-degree C heating element are:  (1)
              spallation of the silica protective layer at 1850/1900 degrees C, which exposes
              the bare molybdenum silicide (MoSi2) to catastrophic oxidation; and (2)
              extensive weakening by rapid grain growth.  Phase I will address both problems
              by:  (1) the use of alloying elements to form an oxidation resistant ternary
              phase molybdenum alumino-silicide, which leads to the formation of an adherent
              alumina layer stable up to 2080 degrees C; and (2) the addition of nano-scale
              alumina or zirconia to stabilize grain growth.  A rapid-heat 2000-degree C
              heating element would be a quantum leap in heating element technology, making
              way for other advances in high temperature manufacturing.
     The technology
              may afford new advances in energy efficiency and manufacturing productivity in 
              ceramics,  metal processing, compound semiconductor processing, glass
              processing, and joining operations.
