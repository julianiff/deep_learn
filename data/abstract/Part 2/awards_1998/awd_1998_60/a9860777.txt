Abstract    :
              9860777
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes
              the development of a disposable, highly efficient suspension bioreactor for
              primary hematopoietic (blood cell-forming) cell culture. The unique challenges
              (heterogeneous nature, donor variability, and shear-sensitivity) of these
              cultures leave traditional flask or suspension cultures unable to consistently
              produce sufficient quantities of cells. In Phase I, small scale experiments
              will guide a redesign of a suspension system to better accommodate
              hematopoietic cultures. The first objective is to balance the requirements of
              oxygen transfer with shear sensitivity by using novel mixing protocols. Second,
              the biocompatibility, mechanical integrity, and fouling characteristics of
              several perfusion membranes will be examined. Third, a low-cost monitoring
              system using disposable pH and DO probes will be developed. In Phase II, a
              large-scale prototype will be constructed and tested under a wide range of
              conditions.
     The final product will be a system that combines the simple,
              disposable nature of flask culture with the control and monitoring capabilities
              of a suspension bioreactor. The resulting system will enable the cost-effective
              production of large numbers of primary hematopoietic cells and will improve the
              effectiveness and decrease the cost of medical procedures in the fields of
              transplantation, immunotherapy, and gene therapy.
