Abstract    :
              9860235
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will investigate rapid response thermistors for ultra-precision manufacturing. 
              State-of-the-art thermistors and competitive products have slow response times
              and high impedance limiting  their applicability for real-time sensing of state
              variables during manufacture.  This proposal addresses the development of
              high-sensitivity, low-power thermistors with broad-band, rapid response,
              prepared by incorporating nano-scale materials (i.e., those materials with
              grain sizes less than 100 nanometers).   These nano-engineered devices will 
              enable near- instantaneous detection of thermal changes, making them applicable
              in machining, welding, non-destructive evaluation (NDE), and casting
              operations.  During Phase I, Nanomaterials Research Corporation will determine
              optimum thermistor compositions, address fabrication issues, characterize
              device performance, and establish proof-of-concept that nano-engineered
              thermistors can be used for real-time thermal monitoring.  The  Phase II effort
              will seek to optimize the technology and produce prototypes for customer
              qualification.  Phase III will commercialize the technology.
