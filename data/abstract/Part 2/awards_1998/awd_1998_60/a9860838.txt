Abstract    :
              9860838
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate the use of redox polymer electrodes for the synthesis of hydrogen
              peroxide through electrochemical regeneration of redox catalyst.  Hydrogen
              peroxide is a clean oxidant with water as its reaction product.  It is
              therefore environmentally acceptable in many industries.  The market for
              peroxide in North America is expected to grow by 10% over the next five years. 
              The existing plants are operating to their full capacity and new plants are
              needed to meet future demand.  New technology using aqueous system that can
              replace the commercial anthraquinone process (using non-aqueous solvents) is
              desirable for the expansion.  This project involves the use of redox polymer
              catalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide in a single reaction step through
              combined electrochemical and chemical reactions.  The Phase I proposal work
              includes preparation of a stable redox polymer catalyst for the production of
              hydrogen peroxide from oxygen or air and water.  Redox polymers will be
              characterized using IR and electrochemical techniques (voltammetry, rotating
              disc experiments).  A laboratory cell of simple design will be operated in the
              Phase I to demonstrate the process and measure peroxide production
              efficiencies.
     The existing plants are operating to their full capacity
              and new plants are needed to meet future demand for production of peroxide. 
              New technology using aqueous system that can replace the commercial
              anthraquinone process (using non-aqueous solvents) is desirable for the
              expansion.  The outcome of the Phase I research would result in new process for
              both on site and central manufacturing facility.
