Abstract    :
              9860357
     Piezoelectric materials have been broadly used in many fields as
              sensors, actuators and transducers. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are
              beginning to find widespread applications in process control, energy
              management, medical and military services. This proposed research is to process
              (0-3) and (3-0) PZT/polymer composites with excellent flexibility, high
              piezoelectric voltage constant and low costs for automobile sensor and
              transducer applications.
     The commercial market of piezoelectrics is ~600
              million U.S. dollars/yr. world wide and expected to grow >5% every year.
              Automotive industry occupies 30% of the whole market. They are introduced to
              replace traditional heavy equipment, such as air bags, suspension, automobile
              switches, fuel level, tire rotation, security systems in automobile
              industry.
