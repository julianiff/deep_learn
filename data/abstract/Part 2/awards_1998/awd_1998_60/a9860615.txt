Abstract    :
              9860615
      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              aims to develop methods to synthesize large volumes of two-photon-transition
              (TPT) materials for 3-D volumetric displays by dispersing rare-earth ion-doped
              organic complexes in photopolymerizable monomer host. Although volumetric
              displays based on two-photon up-conversion using rare-earth ion-doped glass
              have been demonstrated, difficulty in manufacturing glass-based large volume
              display media has hindered further development. The proposed effort will
              address this need by developing a low-cost, scalable synthesis method for
              producing large volumes of TPT materials.  Commercial rare-earth organic
              complexes will be mixed with liquid monomer, followed by W irradiation to form
              a solid. Feasibility and scalability of this approach will be demonstrated by
              producing a hemisphere (6-cm dia.) of Er3+-doped polymer and characterizing the
              two--photon absorption induced fluorescence. To ensure that newly synthesized
              material will satisfy system requirements, a 3-D volumetric display system will
              be designed to determine the concentration and other parameters for the polymer
              display media.
     Large volume display media will allow 3-D volumetric
              displays for air/ground traffic control, medical and scientific 3-D
              visualization and family entertainment, whose market sizes are enormous.
              Significantly lower-cost, higher ion-density, and scalability to large volume
              production make photopolymerizable monomers the ideal host materials for such
              applications.
