Abstract    :
              9860477
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
              the development of Pt-Mo alloys as promising CO-tolerant catalysts for
              application in fuel cells operating on hydrogen from reformed hydrocarbons. In
              this project,  three well-established synthetic methods to prepare high
              dispersion supported Pt-Mo alloys. T/J Technologies, Inc. has extensive
              experience in the dispersion of bifunctional Pt-Ru electrocatalysts on early
              transition metal carbide supports. Drawing on this area of expertise, a
              systematic investigate of three synthetic methods for dispersing the alloy
              catalysts on Vulcan XC-72 to produce alloys of varying composition and
              microstructure.  The company will characterize the composition and
              microstructure of the supported catalysts using electron microscopy and x-ray
              microanalysis. Stripping voltammetry measurements will be performed using
              electrocatalysts deposited onto glassy carbon electrodes. Rotating disk methods
              will be used to measure electro-oxidation activity under defined mass transport
              conditions. In phase II, catalyst microstructure, weight loading, and particle
              size distributions will be optimized to improve electrochemical activity.
    
              Reducing the cost of CO tolerant catalysts addresses a key impediment to the
              commercialization of PEM fuel cells for vehicle propulsion and off-grid
              electric power generation.
