Abstract    :
              9860788
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop glow discharge plasma coatings and arc discharge plasma coatings
              using implantation to relieve stress and enhance adhesion.  These will be
              designed to replace wet chrome plating technology  and conventional titanium
              nitride.  These coatings will scale at low cost to high energies, with the
              attribute that they will conform to the treated surface like a wet coating. 
              These processes are expected to be environmentally benign and to provide
              flexible control over the morphology and chemistry of the coating. Phase I will
              combine the use of low energy plasma ions which provide conformal vapor
              deposition-like coatings with medium energy ions which provide ion beam mixing
              and non-equilibrium solid solutions.  These processes will produce a modified
              surface zone, well integrated with the substrate material, which can be
              deposited over a wide range of thickness from submicron to several tens of
              microns.  The plasma source consists of an arc discharge in conjunction with a
              gas feed  to fabricate the chromium nitride (CrN) hard coatings used in the
              tool industry.  
     This technology may eliminate the present need to use
              environmentally damaging wet processes, such as hard chrome plating, and yet
              reduce the net cost.  It is anticipated to provide a cost-effective surface
              hardening method which will increase coating thickness and provide for improved
              coating adhesion.
