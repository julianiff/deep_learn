Abstract    :
              9860494
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is an
              attempt to spontaneously convert the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide into useful
              byproducts (elemental sulfur and steam) via novel catalytic membrane technology
              developed at Eltron. The approach relies upon the application of proprietary
              mixed oxygen anion and electron conducting brownmillerite membranes and metal
              sulfide-based H2S decomposition catalysts which are compatible for promoting
              the subject reaction. These catalytic membrane reactors will possess the
              general configuration:    H2S, AB2S4 (or
              MS2)/Sr2-xLaxDyFe2-yOs5+x/2/La0.8SrO.2CoO3 (or Ag), O2 (air).   Tubular
              membrane reactor systems will be evaluated for catalytically decomposing H2S to
              H2 and S at 700-900 C followed by hydrogen oxidation to steam from oxygen
              mediated through the ceramic membrane. Preferred membrane components will then
              be incorporated into reactors utilizing a dispersed metal sulfide packed bed to
              further the decomposition of hydrogen sulfide. Work in Phase I will result in
              the identification of preferred components (ceramic membrane, oxidation surface
              catalyst, and packed bed catalyst) and optimal process operating conditions for
              promoting the direct conversion of H2S into elemental sulfur and steam.
    
              Successful completion of this program will result in the development of mixed
              oxygen anion/electron conducting membrane technology capable of efficiently
              promoting the direct conversion of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur and
              water. Due to its more versatile nature and potentially lower costs, this
              membrane technology will find commercial application for replacing current
              Claus processing units for the treatment of H2S. The natural gas processing
              industry, petroleum refining industry, and next generation of coal-fired power
              plants (coal gasification) all will have an interest in this technology.
