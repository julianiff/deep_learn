Abstract    :
              9860826
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Mini-Surgery, Incorporated proposes the development of a Micro-ElectroMechnical
              System ("MEMS") flexural microhydraulic actuator with significant performance
              and cost advantages.  The MEMS-based actuator design enables the use of
              low-cost large-batch planar manufacturing techniques such as thin film
              deposition and etching, lapping, and polishing for production from
              centimeter-scale to sub-millimeter scale.  At the millimeter-to-centimeter
              scale, these devices could be produced at orders of magnitude lower cost than
              conventional hydraulic actuators. 
     The proposed design for a novel,
              miniature, lightweight, low maintenance actuator offers superior reliability,
              speed, and force compared to conventional actuators and micromotors.  The
              actuator is targeted for valves, pumps, compressors, electric motors, and
              sensors in many medical, automotive, aerospace, and industrial devices.
