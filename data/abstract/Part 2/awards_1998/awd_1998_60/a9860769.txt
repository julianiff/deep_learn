Abstract    :
              9860769
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
              investigate pioneering technology to regulate the microclimate on plant
              surface(s) to reduce heat-related damage and subsequent economic losses. This
              would be especially beneficial in the southern U.S. where excessively high
              temperatures occur for prolonged periods. Further, the possibility of global
              warming will likely have an impact on economic crops. As temperatures exceed
              the optimum range for a plant, deleterious symptoms develop. Heat-induced
              symptoms in plants include pollen sterility (e.g. corn), stunted growth,
              smaller/deformed fruit, decreased quality, fewer fruit, less pod fill, and boll
              drop (in cotton). This project will address those critical temperatures where
              the above-mentioned problems begin to develop by actually regulating the
              temperature on the plant surface within a range where damage is eliminated or
              reduced. Innovative microencapsulation techniques for phase change materials
              (microPCMs) and their uses have been developed by Triangle R&D (Subcontractor)
              on SBIR programs from 1984 to 1998. We will evaluate the compatibility of
              microPCMs and the targeted plants; design and fabricate microPCMs to provide
              the optimum temperature range(s) for the target plants; and evaluate the
              microPCM(s) to regulate the plant surface microclimate and reduce heat-related
              symptoms.
     In 1996, the combined value of soybeans, cotton, and corn in
              the U.S. alone was more than 47 billion dollars. Based on the percent of yield
              loss correlated with high temperatures and the temperature history in the
              southern U.S., values for these three major crops could easily be reduced by
              several hundred million dollars, if not more. In addition, drought conditions
              and subsequent irrigation reduce value and add cost to crop production.
              Finally, because of temperatures in the south and southwest, often less
              yielding, but more heat-tolerant cultivars are grown, thus potential for some
              high-yielding cultivars are not realized.
