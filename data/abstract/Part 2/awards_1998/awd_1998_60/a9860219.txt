Abstract    :
              9860219
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore the manufacturability of economical, broad-band, wide dynamic
              range, triaxial force-balance accelerometers, using unique tribo-electric
              transducers with liquid dielectric inertial masses.  Their performance is
              expected to compare well with conventional force balance accelerometers, while
              affording lower cost, low power consumption, and rugged construction.
    
              This accelerometer would find use in measurement of strong ground motion in
              areas of high seismicity as a supplement to conventional seismometer data, in
              instrumentation of civil structures in earthquake prone areas for recording 
              large dynamic loads, and for various other industrial applications.   It may
              also be extended to include purely rotational accelerometers.
