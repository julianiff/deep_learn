Abstract    :
              9860140
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
              the elimination of toxic compounds from air streams. Pulsed corona discharges
              are particularly useful for this application. However, suitable pulse
              modulators are not available, and the efficiency for corona processing must be
              increased to be competitive in many cases. The objective of this project
              (Phases I and II) is to overcome these limitations by demonstrating the
              efficacy of using the novel Advanced Solid-State Modulator (ASM) combined with
              a high temperature (up to 300c"C) corona reactor. Phase I addresses this
              objective through: (1) assembly of a 50 kV, I kW ASM/corona experiment; (2)
              experiments to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility; and (3)
              preliminary design for a 10 kW, Phase II, laboratory prototype ASM/corona
              system. An international pollution control company has already expressed
              interest in this work. This proposal responds to the 1998 NSF emphasis on
              National Critical Technologies in the area of Pollution Minimization and
              Remediation.
     This project will provide the foundation for commercial uses
              in areas including: (1) coating operations; (2) chemical manufacturing; (3)
              fuel and solvent systems; (4) power plants; (5) vehicles; and (6)
              incinerators.
