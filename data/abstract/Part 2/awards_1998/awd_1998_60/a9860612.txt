Abstract    :
              9860612
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will demonstrate the feasibility of computer software that will simulate
              expensive drilling operations, especially deep land and ocean rotary drilling. 
              A finite element model will be used for real time simulation of the drilling
              process performed with roller cone bits.  The simulation will follow bit
              kinetics.  The rock fracturing process during drilling will be dynamically
              modeled.  The software will simulate drilling operation under a set of
              customer-defined working conditions such as rock formation, drill fluid,
              rotation rate, bit parameters, temperature, pressure, etc., and will generate
              predictions of drilling performance such as rate of penetration, power
              requirements, bit wear, and total drill bit productivity.  Computer graphics
              will enhance the presentation of the dynamic simulation, which is anticipated
              will help scientists and engineers gain a clear appreciation of drilling
              processes under way.
     With the help of this computer simulation, engineers
              and scientists monitoring operations on drill rigs will drill more and faster
              for the same cost through parameter optimization; scientists may extract more
              information than before from the data obtained from drilling operations; and
              drill bit manufacturers will find much cheaper ways to evaluate and  improve
              their products.  Through computer stimulation the drilling industry may realize
              new savings in its operating costs because of better understanding of drilling
              operations.
