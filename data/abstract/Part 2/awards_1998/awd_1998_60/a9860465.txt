Abstract    :
              9860465
     The biofouling of netting is a biological problem of considerable
              commercial interest. Fighting net biofouling can consume as much as 40% of
              total labor in an aquaculture.  Biofouled nets, due primarily to trapped water,
              can increase in weight more than one hundred times in air, representing
              substantial tonnage that must be manhandled.  Research on a novel biofouling
              option is proposed.  If successful, the proposed coating will inhibit the
              development of organisms on the net surface without the use of toxicants.
    
               Shellfish and fish farmers around the world are seeking potential solutions to
              the biofouling problem.  In the best case biofouling is a major issue; in the
              worst case it is fatal to the culture.  Commercial applications are wherever
              pestiferous organisms colonize surfaces.
