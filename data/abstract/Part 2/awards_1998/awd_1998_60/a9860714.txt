Abstract    :
              9860714
	In recent years, counterfeiting of currency and credit cards has
              increased to the point where credit card fraud alone worldwide was over one
              billion dollars in 1996, and in the United States more than 25 billion dollars
              in losses to intellectual property infringement have been reported.  This Small
              Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Physical Optics Corporation
              will test the feasibility of a unique Optical Smart Card (OSC) biometric
              identification system based on correlation technique and secure fingerprint
              encryption.  OSC technology has two critical elements:  fully-random
              practically nonreplicable phase-only volume masks to encode and decode a
              reference fingerprint on an ID card; and novel advanced optical data processing
              to identify a live customer's fingerprint, which is invariant to rotation and
              plastic distortion of the finger.  Scanning or replicating OSC masks is
              impossible because of the high optical density of the phase information and
              lamination, which accommodates up to 10 to the power of 30 code combinations. 
              An additional feature of the proposed phase-encoded OSC technology is its
              compatibility with a variety of substrates, including thin foil and plastics
              for both reflection and transmission modes of operation.
	This OSC technology
              proposes to ensure a high level of security, functioning to severely curtail
              credit card fraud and counterfeiting.  This advanced implementation of
              biometrics has the potential to become a valuable tool for banks, credit card
              firms, hospitals, government agencies, and all types of small and large
              businesses to accurately identify individuals, and for overall cellular phone,
              computer, and computer network security.
