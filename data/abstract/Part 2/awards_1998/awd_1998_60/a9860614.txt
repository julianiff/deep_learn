Abstract    :
              9860614
     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is focused
              on an effort to meet a compelling need for new instrumentation for research and
              industrial applications relating to the biological sciences. Specifically, this
              proposal is designed to pursue innovative technology for and to offer
              substantial improvements upon currently available instrumentation for DNA
              analysis. The project pools key enabling proprietary technologies with proven
              R&D expertise and a novel amplification approach to nucleic acid analysis. The
              specific Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the new
              amplification technique which, when combined with AndCare's unique
              electrochemical measurement method, should allow production of an effective new
              biosensor for DNA detection. A successful Phase I program would lead to full
              Phase II integration and demonstration of the concept, process optimization,
              and prototyping in preparation for Phase III commercialization. The anticipated
              result will be new instrumentation based on disposable sensors for nucleic acid
              analysis. The new line of products envisioned as the long-term goal of this
              initial effort would be capable of low-cost, "real time" measurements based on
              the use of self-contained, disposable nucleic acid sensors and notebook-sized,
              low-cost analytical instruments.
     The new analytical products being
              targeted by this effort would represent a key advance in the state of the art
              in high-performance, low-cost biomedical instrumentation that would address
              major domestic and international needs. The device would have application in
              research activities and industrial processes in major areas such as
              environmental biology, plant biology, and molecular biology.
