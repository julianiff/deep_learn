Abstract    :
              9860941
     Ewing Technology Associates, in collaboration with researchers at
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will develop inexpensive point
              sensors with important applications in environmental control systems, chemical
              process flows, and atmospheric monitoring.  The technology to be investigated
              is that of a micro-discharge.  Micro-discharges will be fabricated using
              Si-based IC fabrication technology.  Because of their small dimensions, these
              devices can operate in novel regimes of pressure and excitation.
