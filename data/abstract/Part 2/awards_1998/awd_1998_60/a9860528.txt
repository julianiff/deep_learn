Abstract    :
              9860528
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a chlorophyll fluorescence sensor for deployment on a remote
              operating vehicle (ROV) or towed sled platform.  The sensor will correct the
              measured fluorescence signal for beam attenuation at the blue excitation and
              the red fluorescence emission wavelengths.  The sensor contains a reference
              channel to measure in situ the total beam attenuation coefficients at these
              wavelengths.  A unique feature of the sensor is  a RF modulated blue
              light-emitting diode (LED) excitation source, coupled with frequency-domain
              detection electronics.  This will permit accurate determination of the optical
              measurement pathlength with an optical ranging technique.  Measured pathlength
              and the attenuation coefficients then provide total excitation and fluorescence
              beam attenuation.  In addition to being able to determine the corrected
              fluorescence intensity over a wide range of water optical conditions, the
              sensor will measure chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime.  This feature is
              critical because it will solve the most fundamental problem that plagues simple
              chlorophyll fluorescence intensity measurements for determination of biomass,
              i.e., that chlorophyll fluorescence intensity cannot be directly correlated to
              microalgal biomass because the fluorescence quantum yield of chlorophyll in
              vivo is highly variable.
     Applications are expected in sensors for
              biological oceanography research and for marine environmental monitoring.  In
              addition to marine application, other potential markets include agriculture,
              aquaculture, fish farming, plant genetic engineering, on-line process-analysis
              in bioreactors, and forestry.
