Abstract    :
              9860117
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              investigate, develop and validate Portable high tech sensors for use in a post
              earthquake Rapid Bridge Safety Inspection System (PORBSIS).   The present
              practice of visual safety inspection of bridge and large structure is both
              subjective and unreliable.  Instrument methods, though more reliable, are
              plagued by the lack of accurate and fast data processing method in the case of
              using vibration characteristic, and the lack of adequate view field in the case
              of other visual equivalent.  This project is addressed to a rapid inspection
              method for the structures under a transient live loading.  The novelties of
              this investigation are the use of the newly developed Hilbert Huang Transform
              (Huang, et al., 1998) and the basic Nondestructive Instrument Bridge Safety
              Inspection System (NIBSIS, Huang, 1998).  The advantage of the transient load
              is to have the test load visit every point of the structure.  The NIBSIS, 
              designed to analyze nonlinear and non-stationary time series, will enable the
              severity and location of the defects to be identified.  Furthermore, this
              method requires short inspection time, and small number of sensors.  Thus it
              offers a rapid inspection for bridge after a destructive earthquake.
     To
              maintain the effective and safe use of civil lifeline infrastructure, a rapid
              inspection of bridge after earthquake and natural disasters is critical.  This
              portable rapid inspection method offers a unique alternative for fast decision
              making; therefore, it would be very marketable.
