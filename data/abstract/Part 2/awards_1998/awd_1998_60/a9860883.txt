Abstract    :
              9860883
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              addresses a unifying mathematical framework for three-dimensional tolerance
              analysis which can quantify the flow of variation through a product based upon
              design specifications and associated manufacturing processes.  The hallmark of
              this innovation is  a system of geometric constraint equations that are a
              function of kinematic degrees of freedom (DOF).  The constraints define the
              feasible space for features, components, and part-to-part (assembly)
              relationships due to geometric topology, tolerancing, and the manufacturing
              process.   Sets of equations are solved for the particular homogeneous
              transformation matrices that systematically vary the features and components of
              the resultant feature-based assembly model, allowing for accurate calculation
              and assessment of dimensional requirements.  The  innovation will provide a
              unity calculus for variational modeling at the feature, component, and assembly
              levels, with Phase I emphaizing the  crucial assembly level.  
     Overall
              benefits of this innovation include boarding the application base, ease-of-use,
              and appeal of tolerance analysis, as well as enabling a compelling synchroneity
              with Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) systems.   Applications of computer-aided
              tolerance analysis are anticipated in the design and manufacture of mechanical
              and electrical systems, robust product and process design, simultaneous
              engineering, rapid prototyping, and product quality enhancement.
