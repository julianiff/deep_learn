Abstract    :
              9860868
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
              develop a new method for producing radioactive seeds for cancer brachytherapy. 
              The existing method requires the use of an expensive cyclotron to make
              radioactive 103Pd.  The production rate is therefore limited, the prices are
              high, and there presently exists a severe shortage of seeds for medical
              treatments.  A new, highly efficient method is proposed for producing
              isotopically enriched 102Pd, the precursor for neutron activation to 103Pd.  A
              novel process is also proposed for fabricating the seed, which can be performed
              without the need for handling radioactive liquids and thus promises to
              significantly reduce both manufacturing and medical treatment costs.
