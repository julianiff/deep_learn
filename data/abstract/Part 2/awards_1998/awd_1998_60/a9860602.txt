Abstract    :
              9860602
      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
              aims to tailor and develop  (fiber)-reinforced MOSi2 composites with enhanced
              strength and toughness up to very high temperatures (~1400C). The MOSi2 matrix
              will be formed and reinforced with controlled amounts of SiC fibers (continuous
              or chopped), and the composite densified in one step. The SiC reinforcement
              will provide structural strength and toughness to the composite without adding
              to its weight. Densification will be accomplished in a single step process that
              combines SHS (combustion synthesis) of elemental mixtures of Mo, Si, and C with
              HIPing (electro-consolidation). In-situ reinforcement with continuous or
              chopped SiC fibers will take place through reaction of Si and C at or below the
              adiabatic temperatures of SHS reaction between Mo and Si. Near-net shape
              capability of the process is enhanced by the use of C fiber preforms for
              infiltration. Molybdenum disilicide (MOSi2) has attractive thermal, oxidation,
              and corrosion resistance properties but is weak structurally. Reinforcement
              with a mechanically superior second phase material makes MoSi2-based composites
              serious candidates for useful applications, if the composites can be processed
              to net shape and economically. 
     Immediate commercial use of the
              SiC-toughened MOSi2 composites can be realized as heating elements, combustion
              and burner rigs, and molten metal filters. Future applications include uses for
              aviation and gas turbine engine components, heat exchangers, waste
              incinerators, and hot gas filters. Other advanced applications include energy
              storage devices such as ultracapacitors.
