Abstract    :
              9860415
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop new methods to compute the community-level risk of extinction or
              demographic threat for individual sites or landscapes and assign a multispecies
              conservation value. The objective of such methods is to provide a statistically
              valid approach to ecological valuation and  landscape management. This research
              will provide an independent measure of the value of a particular site based on
              its ecological components, i.e., species, and the threats facing it. The new
              methods will estimate a multispecies conservation value as a spatially explicit
              weighting of species-specific habitat suitability maps by their respective
              species-specific extinction risks. This research will also develop a
              multivariate generalization of recently described exact methods for computing
              risk of extinction for species of which little is known.
     Two potential
              areas of commercial applications of this project include software sales and
              case studies. The final product of the proposed research will be part of RAMAS
              Library of Ecological Software, and will be made available to potential users
              in governmental agencies and industrial companies.
