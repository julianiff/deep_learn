Abstract    :
              9860512
     Rubicon will explore the feasibility of using liquid metal as a
              light valve in display applications.  By varying the applied electric field, a
              liquid metal drop can change between less light blocking shape and more light
              blocking shape, thereby controlling the light passing through the device.  This
              light valve promises higher light transmittance, no angle dependence of view,
              less heat generation and simpler construction.  It will compete with liquid
              crystal technology in the flat panel display market, and especially in the
              projection display market.  The Phase I activity will demonstrate a prototype
              light valve, verifying its operating principles, and optimizing performance.
