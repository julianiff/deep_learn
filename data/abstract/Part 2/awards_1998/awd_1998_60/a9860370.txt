Abstract    :
              9860370
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Accurate Automation Corp. (AAC) will develop and implement a new adaptive
              critic control algorithm for application in flight control.  A learning process
              will also be developed for use with the algorithm.  AAC will evaluate the
              performance of the adaptive critic algorithm in a batch simulated flight
              control application and will perform a preliminary design of a piloted flight
              simulator.  This will set the stage for the implementation of the algorithm in
              the piloted simulator in Phase II.  Adaptive control systems are expected to
              yield significant cost advantages, while also demonstrating important safety
              and reliability advantages.
