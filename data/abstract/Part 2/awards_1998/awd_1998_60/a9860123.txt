Abstract    :
              9860123
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Microprof, Inc. is a research effort to establish the feasibility of an
              authoring system for the creation of multi-user oriented discovery learning
              environments with built-in support for diverse instructional architectures. 
              The proposed authoring system will enable content creators to "embed" domain
              knowledge in a series of activities.  The learners "unlock" the target
              knowledge through successful interactions among themselves and between learners
              and the discovery environment.  The system will foster the creation of
              inherently multi-user-oriented content and will be accessible through PCs or
              networked TVs.
     Microprof's concept of an authoring infrastructure that
              will foster the creation of content for the Internet market stands in contrast
              to an approach involving the simple translation of content created for
              traditional stand-alone single-user PCs.  In view of the increasing access to
              the Internet by students in urban schools and the current low cost of gaining
              access to the networked world from home, Microprof proffers to create a brand
              new segment in the emerging online industry:  educational multi-user games.
