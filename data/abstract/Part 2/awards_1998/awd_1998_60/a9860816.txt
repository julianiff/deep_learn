Abstract    :
              9860816
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              explore new programming language concepts aimed at software development of
              complex hybrid systems: systems containing both discrete (digital) and
              continuous (analog) components. Many common applications are in fact hybrid
              systems - for example, interactive graphics and animation, vision and robotics,
              and manufacturing control systems - and they are often tedious to program. This
              approach is based on a continuous reactive core language that permits the
              expression of pure, continuous behaviors, coupled with a notion of discrete
              reactivity with both internal and external stimuli. The potential pay-off is
              high in terms of cost savings in software development and maintenance. In
              addition, this approach will enhance robustness, safety, and security, since it
              facilitates the application of formal methods to verify critical system
              properties.
     Potential commercial applications of this technology include
              multimedia desktop applications that are expanding. With the recent surge in
              hardware development to support high-quality 3D graphics and related
              technologies, the need for high-level programming tools will only increase. A
              second market that we plan to target is scientific programming, in particular
              prototyping applications for which commercial systems such as Mathematica play
              an important role.
