Abstract    :
              9860907
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will investigate the material and design changes that are required to build
              low-cost flywheel energy storage systems for use in polar
environments.  
              Significant progress has been recently made in reducing the cost and complexity
              of magnetic bearing, vacuum, and motor/generator systems and in low-cost
              composite flywheel rims.   Material property studies at low temperatures are
              required to predict the performance of flywheel components over the required
              operating temperature range of -75  to 130 degrees  Centigrade.   Phase I will
              test and evaluate composite materials for use in low ambient temperature
              operations.   Another objective is to design innovative low-cost flywheel rims
              with satisfactory low temperature performance, using the materials selected in
              the project.
     It is anticipated that flywheel technology will fulfill the
              promise of environmentally friendly energy generation and storage when 
              combined  with emerging high-performance, renewable solar and wind resources. 
              In addition to  applications in polar regions, large markets are expected in
              developing countries where construction of a national energy grid is
              prohibitively expensive.
