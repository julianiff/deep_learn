Abstract    :
              9860480
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project wil
              explore high rate/high precision machining of hard nonferrous alloys,
              composites, and ceramics using cutters made from a new material, tricontinuous
              diamond-tungsten carbide (WC)-cobalt (Co) (TDWC). Currently, polycrystalline
              diamond (PCD) is used in machining; however, low impact resistance does not
              allow machining of  parts with interrupted cuts, and  PCD's large grain size
              limits its application in precision machining.   TDWC is a continuous composite
              consisting of intercalated diamond and WC-Co that exhibits granite cutting
              volumes characteristic of PCDs and will have impact resistance characteristic
              of WC-Co.  Phase I  will focus on design and fabrication of TDWC based cutters
              and will demonstrate their performance for high rate machining of
              difficult-to-manufacture materials.  Phase II will develop TDWC sintering of
              nanograined materials for high precision tools, scaled for fabrication of
              conventional-size industrial cutters.
     TDWC based cutters are expected to
              revolutionize machining in the nonferrous, composite, and ceramics
              manufacturing industries, allowing high rate high precision machining of these
              advanced materials with significant reduction in manufacturing cost and
              increase in productivity.   Commercial sales of  TDWC-based inserts are
              anticipated for Phase III.
