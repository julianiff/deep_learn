Abstract    :
              9860435
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore the brazing of silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic components together
              for use at high temperature.  Thermodynamically, many devices such as heat
              engines operate most efficiently at high temperature.   Although SiC has the
              performance characteristics that make it attractive for extreme conditions, the
              high cost of producing complex components necessitates a reliable joining
              process by which a part can endure long term exposure to harsh conditions. 
              Traditional joining technologies, such as brazing, tend to form brittle phases
              within the joint due to excessive diffusion of elements between the silicon
              carbide and the braze foil metals.  Phase I will use a multilayer braze foil
              whose composition resists influx of Si, and forms diffusion barriers within the
              joint during the brazing process.  The resulting joint is expected to remain
              immune to decomposition and formation of brittle phases during long term
              exposure at temperatures above 1OOO degrees Centigrade.
     Commercial
              applications are anticipated in the production of complex components for high
              temperature environments such as those associated with combustion chambers, gas
              turbines, and heat exchangers.
