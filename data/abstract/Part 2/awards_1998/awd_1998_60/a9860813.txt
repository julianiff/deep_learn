Abstract    :
              9860813
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Immersion Corporation will lower barriers that blind and visually impaired
              students experience in science education.  Electrostatic fields, aerodynamics,
              molecular attraction, and mechanics are examples of undergraduate topics that
              intensively utilize visual media such as plotted data, computer graphics, and
              illustrations.  Immersion has developed low-cost computer mouse capable of
              force display.  This mouse will enable students to feel forces generated by
              simulations of these phenomena, turning inaccessible abstractions into tangible
              reality.  The proposed work will develop enabling software for Internet force
              feedback and will apply it to a demonstration module designed for blind and
              visually impaired students.  A team of blind scientists and educators will
              evaluate the application over the Internet.  The next phase of the research
              will continue enabling software development, concluding in-depth assessment of
              outcomes using visually-impaired novice learners, and it will expand
              implementation to multiple educational sites.
     This project will provide
              essential steps in integrating persons with disabilities into Word Wide Web
              based learning technologies.  While a number of investigators have examined the
              potential for mapping visual information to the sense of touch, to date, these
              have not proven commercially viable.  Immersion's proposed touch surface,
              however, has the potential to meet accessibility needs of the blind and
              visually-impaired while achieving volume economies through mass-market
              appeal.
