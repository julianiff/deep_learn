Abstract    :
              9860239
     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research  Phase I project
              from Structured Materials Industries Inc., will  show proof-of-principle that
              the firm  can make transparent Diodes (p-type ZnO by, PE-MOCVD). Japanese
              researchres recently announced that they had succeeded in forming nitrogen
              doped room temperature p-type ZnO transparent and conductive thin films.
              Heretofore, transparent (wide bandgap) conductive oxides have almost
              exclusively been n-type. We have been highly successful in producing a variety
              of n-type highly conductive. highly luminescent and near epitaxial ZnO based
              films. If stable p-type transparent oxides can be repeatedly and economically
              reproduced then a great variety of new and enhanced ,wholly transparent device
              applications become available. Applications include: diodes, transistors,
              photovoltaics, sensors, p-type semiconductor contact layers, LEDs, OLEDs, among
              other devices. Based upon our capabilities, we are strongly positioned to
              investigate and develop p-type ZnO based films and devices. We  propose, in
              Phase I, to perform a rapid proof-of-principle p-type ZnO materials deposition
              and characterization study, and for the first time,  demonstrate a transparent
              oxide solid state p-n junction diode. The films and diodes will be
              characterized  and material and device theory will be developed. In Phase II.
              SMI will focus on refining materials and processes and produce commercializable
              transparent p-n diode devices.
     Development of wide bandgap p-type
              transparent conductive oxides, combined with our existing n-type transparent
              conductive oxides could expand and generate several markets, including those of
              diode. transistors, wholly transparent displays. UV/blue emitters and
              detectors, and so on. Market leadership will result from materials
              capabilities.
