Abstract    :
              9860484
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop an innovative sensor based on photoacoustic spectroscopy, for real-time
              detection of trace impurities important in microelectronics manufacturing.  Gas
              feedback quality is an important measurement for any process control strategy
              because contaminants at the part per billion level can limit product yield. 
              The unwanted components are often ubiquitous in air and can enter process tools
              along a variety of pathways.  The sensor being developed should be useful for
              both corrosive and non-corrosive process gases, and will find application in
              virtually all microelectronic fabrication methods.  Furthermore, such sensors
              may be sufficiently cost-effective that one might be installed at each process
              tool.  Phase I experiments will focus upon trace moisture detection, and the
              associated tasks are designed to determine water vapor detection limits and to
              identify limiting noise sources.
