Abstract    :
              9860316l
     Material and process specifications are vital for any
              organization involved in complex manufacturing.  Specifications (specs) are
              often comprehensive and voluminous, covering hundreds of characteristics such
              as the material properties, testing parameters, and processing requirements. 
              The methods used to review and analyze specs, however, are labor-intensive,
              time consuming, and all too often produce results that have a negative impact
              on quality.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Renaissance Engineering, Inc. seeks to create a conceptual design for tools
              which provide computer-assistance in the interpretation of spec requirements
              based on the theories of Information Extraction.  The project bases the
              analysis of specification content on an emerging meta-specification created as
              a result of previous NSF support.  This meta-specification provides ontology
              for capturing and re-using the semantic knowledge contained in the body of
              specs.  The tools created as a result of this research would be used to convert
              existing test-based specs into the computer-sensible ontology.
     Tools that
              access specifications in an intelligent, computerized format such as those
              proffered by Renaissance Engineering are of importance to the many
              organizations that have their processing, inspecting, and testing controlled by
              specifications including the Federal Government, and suppliers and prime
              contractors for many industries, particularly aerospace, automotive, chemicals,
              pharmaceuticals, and electronics.
