Abstract    :
              9860582
     Wavefront Research Inc. will establish the feasibility of
              constructing high performance devices based on a novel Liquid Crystal (LC)
              composite material.  The composite nature of the material decreases the
              switching speed of the devices made with nematic liquid crystals by a factor of
              100-1000.  These materials are also capable of grey scale response, and can
              achieve a half-wave retardance at IR wavelengths in just a single layer,
              several microns thick.  During this effort, variable beamsplitters will be
              constructed and characterized, and the materials formulation and fabrication
              process will be engineered to optimize device performance.  The electrooptic
              devices developed in the project will combine the best features available in
              nematic- and ferroelectric LC-based devices.
