Abstract    :
              9860786
     This Small Business Innovation Phase I Project addresses a novel
              chemical approach to fabricating copper interconnects for integrated circuits.
              A silicon/silicon dioxide wafer surface will be patterned by electron beam
              writing using a charge-writing scanning electron microscope with lines 30 nm in
              width; these will then be decorated with positively charged l.4 nm gold
              nanoparticles from solution. These will be the seed layers for
              autometallographic deposition of metallic copper from a solution containing
              copper (II) ions in a selectively reducing environment. Before electron beam
              charge-writing is attempted, the individual steps in the process will be
              optimized using a modified xerographic or laser printer: instead of charged
              carbon, the amorphous selenium or cadmium sulfide transfer roller will be used
              to transfer the charged gold clusters onto membranes, where the patterns will
              be visualized by copper autometallography.
     The proposed approach may
              enable the fabrication of copper interconnects 30 nm (O.03 um) in width,
              significantly smaller than the 0.18 um which is the smallest current width,
              resulting in higher chip packing density and further miniaturizing the
              construction of electronic components. This chemical approach will also
              simplify IC fabrication by removing the photoresist masking and metal etch
              steps.
