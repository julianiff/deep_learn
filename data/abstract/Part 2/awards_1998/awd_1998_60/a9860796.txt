Abstract    :
              9860796
	This Small Business Innovation Research project from ACT Research
              Corporation seeks to establish the feasibility of a multi-user, volumetric 3D
              visual interface system that can be used for various applications involving
              volumetric 3D data handling in a computing environment.  The proposed system is
              based on a patented technology developed by ACT called Volumetric Image Display
              (VID).  VID is capable of displaying 3D volumetric images in real space, which
              can be viewed from all directions by multiple users without the use of any
              headgear.  The combination of spatial and omniviewing features enables most
              natural human-machine interaction through vision-motor coordination to
              effectively visualize and manipulate complex 3D data in a real space.  The
              Phase I objective is to develop a prototype software toolkit and to evaluate
              the system using radiation cancer treatment planning as the first application. 
              In this field, there is a need for methods to better visualize the alignment of
              treatment beams in relation to the cancer tissue and its surrounding healthy
              tissues.
	ACT Research anticipates near term application of the system for
              visualization in radiation treatment planning.  Commercial potential is also
              anticipated in other areas such as computer model visualization for product and
              building design, computed flow/flame field visualization for aerospacecraft
              design, geological data visualization for oil mining, molecular structure
              visualization for pharmaceutical development, and 3D game machines for
              entertainment.
