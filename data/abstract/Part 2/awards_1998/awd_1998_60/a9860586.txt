Abstract    :
              9860586
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore use of low value residual edgings from sawmill operations to
              manufacture a structural quality engineered wood composite called Structural
              Strand Lumber (SSL).  Edgings are created when round logs are sawn into
              rectangular pieces of lumber.  The SSL concept is to cut these edgings into
              strands, align them directionally, and then glue and compress them into a high
              value product.  Edging material currently is used for low value wood chips for
              paper making.  The SSL  manufacturing process should yield a high value added
              wood product, dramatically reduce waste, reduce demand on natural resources,
              and increase sawmill efficiency.  Phase I research will provide a fundamental
              understanding  for enabling optimal SSL processes and demonstrate their
              feasibility  in sawmill operations.  Phase II would demonstrate the operation
              of a SSL prototype manufacturing facility.
     SSL manufacturing is expected
              to  increase the efficiency of sawmill operations  dramatically,  while
              reducing environmental consequences of sawmill operations.  Up to 14% more of
              forest raw materials could be converted to high value wood  products with the
              proposed process.
