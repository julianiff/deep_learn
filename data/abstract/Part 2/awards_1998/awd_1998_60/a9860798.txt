Abstract    :
              9860798
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  will develop an
              in-line, FTIR-based sensor to monitor the chemistry of new deep ultraviolet
              chemically amplified resist materials used for advanced submicron
              photolithography in the semiconductor industry.  A novel Fourier Transform
              InfraRed microscope integrated directly upon a commercial lithographic cluster
              tool will be developed that will provide rapid data on the resist chemistry
              between process steps.  The sensor will incorporate optics and algorithms
              tailored to the analysis of photoresist chemistry.  The proposed technology
              will lead to improved understanding of new, chemically amplified resists used
              for sub-micron lithography of semiconductor devices, which will lead to
              decreased process and product development times, higher yields and potentially
              closed-loop process control for lithographic applications.
