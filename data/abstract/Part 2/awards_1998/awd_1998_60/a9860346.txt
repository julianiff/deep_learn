Abstract    :
              9860346
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              Brewer Science Inc. will demonstrate a new negative-working electron beam
              resist for sub-150 nm lithography.  The current portfolio of electron beam
              resist products is based primarily on organic polymers with poor plasma etching
              resistance.  Yet these resists are of critical importance in the
              microelectronics industry, for future mask production and eventually for IC
              production by projection and direct write electron beam lithography.  The
              resist concept which Brewer Sciences Inc. will pursue in this work will
              overcome the limitations of current resist products by utilizing a
              radiation-crosslinkable organotitanium polymer as the primary resist component,
              in order to achieve high sensitivity and resolution at 50kV exposure energies
              along with exceptional plasma etching resistance.
