Abstract    :
              9860110
     This SBIR Phase I Project focuses on mass production of triploid
              marine shrimp. Marine shrimp culture experienced exponential growth between
              1980 and 1990, increasing from 5% to 28% of total world production. Since then,
              farmed shrimp production has stagnated due to disease and water quality
              problems. Disease problems are largely due to dependence on wild caught shrimp
              broodstock and seed which carry many untreatable viral diseases. A solution to
              this problem is closed-cycle culture using specific pathogen free (SPF) and
              specific disease resistant (SDR) shrimp. Closed-cycle culture also permits
              genetic selection for improved culture performance. To protect a seed
              producer's investments in SPF, SDR and genetic selection, it is highly
              desirable to sell only sterile seed. Triploidy is a possible solution since
              triploids of other species are typically sterile but may exhibit superior
              culture characteristics. In addition, use of sterile triploids allows use of
              exotic shrimp species in environmentally sensitive culture areas where
              exclusion of exotics is a consideration. We propose to develop means of mass
              production of triploid, Mexican whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and giant
              tiger prawn (P. monodon) seed. Initial emphasis will be on tetraploidy
              induction.
     A successful outcome of our R&D effort will result in
              significant changes in marine shrimp culture. First, it will help stimulate
              large-scale investment in SPF, SDR, genetic selection and closed-cycle shrimp
              culture. Secondly, it will help create opportunities to expand use of exotic
              shrimp species into environmentally sensitive culture areas. Our company
              intends to be at the forefront of these opportunities.
