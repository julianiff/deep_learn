Abstract    :
              9860247
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              addressed to the development and testing of a wireless system which will make
              use of Acoustic Emission Technology that is both practical and affordable on
              longer sections of pipeline pipe. The resulting system will enable the user to
              locate, within plus or minus 5 feet, the origin of sounds of distress from the
              pipe, enabling far less expensive point repairs rather than outright
              replacement. Development is based on signal processing techniques to identify
              the very distinguishable sounds of distress and an exclusive method of
              determining the location of the sounds through use of multiple wireless
              sensors.
     If the research is successful, the results have the potential of
              saving water districts from $1million to $15 million per mile in replacement
              costs for the nation's 20,000+ mile ($40 billion) concrete water main
              infrastructure.  It will have application at water districts and electric
              utilities worldwide.  The company projects their acoustic pipe testing revenues
              to reach $36,000,000 within 5 years, assuming a 5% market penetration. Longer
              term application to other pipe and civil structures is also foreseen.
