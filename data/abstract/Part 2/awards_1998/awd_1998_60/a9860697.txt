Abstract    :
              9860697
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a
              planar magnetic levitator/positioner for precision microelectronics
              manufacturing equipment applications. This technology is based on the
              proof-of-concept magnetic levitation stage developed by the Principal
              Investigator during his doctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology. The maglev stage described in this proposal is the first to provide
              all the motions required for photolithography in semiconductor manufacturing
              with a single magnetically levitated platen. The platen is driven in all
              six-degree-of-freedom motions with small adjustments for focusing and alignment
              and large planar motions for positioning across the wafer surface. In this
              project, the feasibility and the performance limitation of the planar magnetic
              levitation technology will be investigated.
     Currently, three foreign
              companies share 80% of the photolithography wafer stepper market. The proposed
              technology herein may be a corner stone for the U.S. to solidify the leadership
              position in the highly profitable and competitive microelectronics
              manufacturing capital equipment business. Besides wafer steppers, this
              technology can be applied to other manufacturing equipment that require precise
              planar position control, such as wire bonders, surface profilometers, scanned
              probe microscopes, and precision inspection machines.
