Abstract    :
              9860053
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will explore improved imaging of subsalt oil and gas reservoirs  by
              incorporating converted wave energy into the seismic migration process.   It is
              difficult to obtain high-quality earth images -  necessary in contemporary
              reservoir development and exploration -  in complex subsalt geologic
              structures.  In such regions, conventional seismic technology, using
              compressional wave data without accounting for converted waves, may incorrectly
              position geological features, or otherwise not image them at all.   3-D seismic
              imaging is dependent on successful parameterization of the wave propagation
              phenomena with asymptotic Green's functions generated by ray tracing or
              finite-difference traveltime calculation.  To determine the feasibility of
              imaging with converted waves, a petrophysical analysis of subsalt reservoir
              environments will be coupled with realistic elastic synthetic modeling of
              seismic wave propagation.  The synthetic data will be compared to the results
              of elastic ray tracing to determine how the elastic ray tracing can effectively
              parameterize the important converted wave propagation effects.  Phase II would
              involve development of a converted wave imaging algorithm  seamlessly
              integrated with a standard imaging algorithm, so that the more expensive
              converted wave imaging calculations need only be carried out in small target
              areas.
     Subsalt oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico are costly to
              produce and therefore require sophisticated and detailed 3-D seismic imaging. 
              This seismic imaging technology is expected to be applied to exploration and
              reservoir development in geological environments of this kind.
