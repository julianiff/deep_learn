Abstract    :
              9860196
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project offers
              potentially enormous public health benefits while substantially reducing the
              costs of water quality monitoring.  There are 1. 5 million monitoring sites in
              the U.S. mandated by either the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act.
               Current sampling and analysis techniques are extremely labor intensive and
              costly. Using today's methods, monitoring costs frequently exceed remediation
              costs. More importantly, the current practice doesn't detect spikes, surges, or
              spills which, if undetected, can create the huge expense of cleanup or worse. 
              This project centers on a low-cost, continuous on-line monitor to detect the
              presence of heavy metals, nitrates, and other pollutants in public water
              supplies and wastewater effluents, and to provide uninterrupted "spike
              detection" for more than 100 toxic substances.  It combines two proven
              technologies. The research objectives will determine (1) how well the two
              technologies will each perform their intended function when working together,
              and (2) how robust the invention is, i.e., over what range of selected
              parameters will the invention perform its intended function.
     The
              technology will have broad applicability in municipal water and wastewater
              treatment systems, process industries, other significant industrial users, and
              filtration applications.
