Abstract    :
              9860643
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
              identify the means to produce a material which is injection moldable,
              machinable upon curing, and which exhibits strength properties comparable to
              steel.  Moreover, the cost can be an order of magnitude less than that of
              steel.  Such a material can be created on the basis of nanofiber reinforced
              cement (NRC), using macro defect free cement which has been densified with
              small particles and reinforced with coal derived carbon nanofibers. 
     This
              material can be used in markets currently occupied by specialty cement, and may
              also intrude in applications now occupied by steel and ceramics, such as
              structural reinforcement.
