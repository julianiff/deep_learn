Abstract    :
              9860374
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a proof
              of principle for the fabrication of high density, highly adhesive, lubricious,
              ultra hard boron coatings using a vacuum cathodic arc with a heated, solid
              boron cathode.  The preferred structure of the coating will be an amorphous sub
              oxide of boron (11 or 22 B to 1 O), which has a high surface hardness to
              elastic modulus ratio and has been and produced (with less commercially
              attractive methods) and studied at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). 
              The technical tasks are to improve an existing cathodic arc setup for better
              vacuum integrity, improve the structural integrity of the boron cathode and its
              support structure, as well as the method of heating the cathode.  The resulting
              films will be analyzed  at the same ORNL facility, where the previously studied
              boron coatings were produced and analyzed.  The emphasis in this phase is in
              achieving the correct stoichiometry.  The advantages of the cathodic arc are
              control of ion energies, low substrate temperatures and the avoidance of toxic
              gases involved in plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition.
     Boron
              coatings have excellent hardness, tribological (low friction) and corrosion
              resistance properties.  Their high temperature compatibility would make them
              ideal for advanced automotive applications.  For example, such coatings would
              eliminate the need for lubricants in high temperature, low heat loss diesel
              engines, leading to substantial reduction in particulate emissions.
