Abstract    :
              9860665
     The growth in the use and storage of multi and hyperspectral image
              data sets has necessitated the use of image compression for telecommunications,
              storage, and dissemination of this imagery due to the sheer volume of data. The
              need for high-quality low bitrate compression cannot be met with the current
              technological standard, JPEG. New technologies have been developed which
              significantly outperform JPEG. Wavelet/TCQ is among the best compression
              algorithms in the scientific literature and has been selected by the ISO JPEG
              standards committee as the baseline algorithm for the newly developing JPEG
              2000 standard. In Phase 1, we will develop a quad-tree spatial segmentation
              technique based on maximizing coding gain to add to JPEG-2000. Several
              different linear decorrelating transforms will be examined including band
              prediction and the KLT and will be compared against a 3D wavelet transform.
              Additionally, spectral segmentation of multispectral data will be developed
              based on global band correlation. Phase II will involve the investigation of
              more sophisticated segmentation techniques and design of a hardware/software
              system for the compression multispectral and multicomponent imagery.
    
              Numerous commercial and governmental applications utilize multispectral
              imagery. Applications include remote sensing, reconnaissance, and mapping.
              Medical imaging, telemedicine, and medical databases can also benefit from this
              technology. MRI and CAT data sets share many similarities with multispectral
              imagery.
