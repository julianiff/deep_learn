Abstract    :
              9860634
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              aims to develop a very inexpensive process for fabricating carbon
              nanostructures based on a newly developed technique for using microwaves to
              promote the uniform growth of very highly graphitic nanotubes. These fibers are
              reliably and reproducibly synthesized via a combination of plasma decomposition
              of methane and chemically catalyzed deposition of carbon. The resultant
              structures are <100 nm filamentary carbon strands with length of up to several
              hundred microns. 
     This project will characterize the noteworthy
              properties of these nanostructures, develop the means to reproducibly
              manufacture them, and show how they may be advantageously added to the
              production of cost-effective composite materials for aerospace, automotive and
              other commercial applications.
