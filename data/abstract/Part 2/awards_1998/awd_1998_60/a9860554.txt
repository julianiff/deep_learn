Abstract    :
              9860554
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              develop chromate-free conversion coatings for high copper-content aluminum
              alloys, such as 2024-T3, based on the formation of hydrotalcite.  Chemical
              conversion coatings have found widespread commercial and military applications
              in the protection of aluminum alloys, commonly used in automobile and aircraft
              manufacturing as structural materials.  This is due to their excellent
              corrosion resistances and their abilities to serve as effective bases for
              paints.  However, conventional chemical conversion baths contain hexavalent
              chromium and ferricyanide, which are highly toxic.  The continued use of
              chromate conversion coatings has made the metal finishing industry one of the
              most significant contributors to environmental pollution.  Thus, it is highly
              desirable to develop conversion-coating technologies utilizing non-chromate
              chemicals that can serve as alternative methods.  The key to this project is
              the use of environmentally benign chemicals to form hydrotalcite-based coatings
              with excellent corrosion resistances.  Conversion coatings will be performed
              with the aid of activators under optimal temperatures to accelerate the
              reaction rate.  The formed coatings will be further treated with a simple
              organic compound to obtain hydrophobic and self-healing characteristics to
              enhance their corrosion resistances.
     The developed non-chromate,
              hydrotalcite-based conversion coating process could totally replace the
              polluting chromate conversion coating in metal finishing.  This novel
              technology will be economically viable and be very beneficial with respect to
              environmental protection and human health.
