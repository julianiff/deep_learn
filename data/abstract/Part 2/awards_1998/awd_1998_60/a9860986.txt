Abstract    :
              9860986
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate novel optical buffers based on spatial-spectral holography (SSH)
              for use in optical networks. Such a buffering capability will make optical
              switches much more compatible with the incumbent electronic switching
              technology. This will greatly advance the penetration of optical networking
              into government and commercial optical fiber communications networks,
              particularly for data communications applications. During the Phase I effort,
              the following tasks will be accomplished: (1) develop a theoretical model for
              SSH recording and retrieval processes, (2) survey of potential recording
              materials, (3) pilot experiment to demonstrate SSH at 1550 nm, (4) explore
              options for operation configurations, (5) explore architectures for integration
              of optical buffers with optical networks, and (6) final report.
    
              Spatial-spectral holographic optical buffers have the potential to be the input
              buffers for Wavelength Selective Cross-connects (WSXC) and other optical
              network elements. As such, they will find widespread application in high
              performance WDM networks.
