Abstract    :
              9860365
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop, test and establish the feasibility of an innovative numerical imaging
              algorithm, the so-called Elliptic Systems Method (ESM), for the case of
              frequency-resolved data in Optical/Diffusion Tomography. The strategic goal is
              to build and market an Optical Mammography device. In pursuing this goal, in
              the ESM has decisive advantages over other competing imaging algorithms in
              Diffusion Tomography, such as high speed, robustness, and accuracy. This method
              has previously proven excellent for the more costly time-resolved data. The
              code will be tested on both simulated and experimental data. The mathematical
              tools will be developed in parallel with the development of an experimental
              hardware device (funds raised from private investors will be used for the
              hardware side).
     The principal commercial application of company's
              interest is in optical mammography. The technique which will be developed in
              this project is also applicable to optical imaging of targets in foggy
              atmosphere, optical imaging of underwater mines, nondestructive evaluation,
              etc.
