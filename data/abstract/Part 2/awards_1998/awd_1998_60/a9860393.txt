Abstract    :
              9860393                                                                         
                                                                                             
                    Large tracking volumes are needed for many virtual environments yet
              current commercial head-trackers, based mainly on magnetic technology, allow
              accurate performance only in a small volume.  This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project  from Resolution Displays, Inc. seeks to design,
              build, and demonstrate a head-tracker capable of measuring the positions (in
              six-degrees-of-freedom) in a practically unlimited volume.  Current
              head-tracking technology is dominated by magnetic field generation and
              detection techniques.  Magnetic head-trackers work well in a small volume
              (within a radius of 30 inches from the source) but the performance degrades
              sharply as a function of distance from the source.  A small tracking volume
              also makes it difficult to accommodate simultaneous users.  The proposed
              head-tracking system uses an innovative technique that allows the use of a
              large number of ultrasonic transducers thus greatly expanding the
              three-dimensional range at which measurements can be made and mitigating
              line-of-sight problems.  In addition, the use of inexpensive piezo ultrasonic
              transducers and the continually decreasing price of powerful digital signal
              processors makes it possible to devise a low cost product
     This project
              has the potential to make an important contribution to the field of computer
              simulation technology.  In virtual reality applications, poor accuracy
              manifests itself as jitter of the image in the head-mounted display (HMD). 
              Resolution Displays anticipates the technical specifications of its proposed
              head-tracking technology--translation jitter of 0.01 inches rms maintained
              within this volume with an update rate up to 200 Hz--to enable an increase in
              tracking volume so as to greatly expand the number of new computer simulation
              applications using virtual environments and to enable old applications to
              perform better.
