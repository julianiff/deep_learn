Abstract    :
              9860114
     This Small Business Innovation Research project will study the
              feasibility of commercializing a new lithium salt for Rechargeable Solid
              Lithium Batteries. These batteries are not commercially available, due to the
              problems related to the commercialization of a key part of the battery, the
              solid polymeric electrolyte (SPE). New materials are needed that will improve
              the performance of the SPE while maintaining a simple and cost effective
              formulation. To that end, this project will outline the design, synthesis and
              testing of a new lithium salt that will improve and simplify any given SPE. A
              multifunctional salt is presented that will both improve the conductivity and
              the morphology of the SPE by combining two key features, low lattice energy and
              plasticizing ability. The salt will be synthesized using well-documented
              procedures, formulated into test SPEs and evaluated and compared with the
              industry-wide standard commercially available lithium salt, lithium
              bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. This Phase I research plan will concentrate
              on direct comparisons between the salt used currently and the new salt
              described in this proposal.
     Solid state ion-conducting electrolytes can
              be used in a wide range of commercial applications. Flexible rechargeable
              lithium batteries will be used in mobile communication equipment, laptop
              computers, and electric vehicles. Outside of the battery industry,
              ion-conducting membranes will be applied to electrochemical sensors and
              artificial muscles.
