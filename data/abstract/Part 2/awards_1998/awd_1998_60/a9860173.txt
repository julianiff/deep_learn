Abstract    :
              9860173
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the
              goal of producing a 10W Non-Planar Ring Oscillator, similar in concept to the
              company's highly successful Lightwave Series 126, but borrowing ideas normally
              associated with lasers >1OW. LIGO interferometers rely on state-of-the-art
              single frequency lasers. The company has produced such lasers for these
              applications.  However, major simplifications can be made in the design, while
              improving performance. These new designs will be investigated.  The result of
              this research is expected to have long-lasting benefits, as various non-linear
              optical devices will be enabled through the technique of external
              resonantly-enhanced processes. This includes CW Optical Parametric Oscillators
              and CW second, third and fourth harmonic generation. The new design concepts
              proposed here reduces the size, cost and complexity of a 1OW LIGO-capable laser
              by a full order of magnitude. This factor of ten reduction is critical for
              commercial success of this useful technology.
     Through non-linear
              generation of the output of the laser described here, a variety of
              applications, currently served by ion lasers, can adopt the much more favorable
              solid-state technology. These include laser projection display,
              stereo-lithography, and reprographics.
