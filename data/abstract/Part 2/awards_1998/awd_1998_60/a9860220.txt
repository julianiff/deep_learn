Abstract    :
              9860220
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop microsensors for determination and control of air quality in building
              environments.  By one estimate, about two million commercial buildings have
              been reported to exhibit poor indoor air quality, which adversely affects
              fourteen million workers. Additionally, poor indoor air quality also has been
              identified to be responsible for over 125 million lost school days and over 10
              million lost workdays per year. Clearly, there is a need for reliable
              technologies that can cost-effectively determine, control, and improve  indoor
              air quality. This project seeks to develop non-stoichiometric,
              semiconductor-based sensors incorporating unique nanoscale materials (i.e.,
              those materials with grain sizes less than 100 nanometers) for detecting one of
              the most prevalent VOCs that adversely affects indoor air quality, namely
              formaldehyde.  During Phase I, Nanomaterials Research Corporation will
              determine optimum sensor compositions, address fabrication issues, characterize
              performance, and establish proof-of-concept that nano-precision-engineered
              sensors can be retrofitted into existing HVAC equipment.  The Phase II effort
              will seek to optimize the technology and produce prototypes for customer
              qualification. Phase III will commercialize the technology.
     The  research
              would provide robust sensors for determination and control of air quality. The
              effort will also help enable prevention of air quality problems in industrial
              buildings, homes, automobiles, and civic buildings.
