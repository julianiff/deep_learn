Abstract    :
              9860550
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to
              design and develop new water-based corrosion resistant silicon coatings.  There
              are a number of corrosion resistant coatings for aircrafts available in the
              market and the majority of them either contain carcinogenic chromates or are
              volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The use of these coatings containing
              carcinogens and/or VOCs is not acceptable due to the ill-effects of these
              chemicals to humans and the environment.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to
              develop water-based coatings containing environmentally safe ingredients, which
              have superior corrosion resistant properties.  This firm has invented a number
              of water-based coatings to coat aluminum, carbon steel and stainless steel
              substrates.  The preliminary results of these coatings on carbon steel show
              that the adhesion on the metal is excellent and the coatings possess corrosive
              resistant properties in atmospheric and aqueous environments.  The coated
              substrates will be tested for corrosion resistance up to 500 C and the salt fog
              test (ASTM B-117 and ASTM G85) will also be carried out.  Electrochemical
              Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) measurements will be performed on these coated
              substrates to ascertain the corrosion resistant nature of the coatings.  The
              results of Phase I and Phase II research will provide corrosion protection
              coating formulations for a range of metallic substrates and these coatings will
              be efficient,  low cost, and environmentally benign.
     The water-based
              coatings can be used in the exhaust components of automobiles and diesel
              engines.  They can be used for substrates ranging from aluminum for the
              aerospace industry to carbon steel for the automobile industry.  They can also
              be used as corrosion resistant liners in reaction vessels of the chemical
              industry.
