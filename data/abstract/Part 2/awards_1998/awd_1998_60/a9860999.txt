Abstract    :
              9860999
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              contribute mathematical services in signal and image processing to the
              distributed Java computing space. A major component of internetworked
              information is digital images and audio signals. Current vector, signal, and
              image processing standards are evaluated to achieve advanced signal processing
              for Java. Vector signal and image processing (VSIP) constitutes a viable option
              for commercialization in the distributed Java environment. This effort seeks to
              make the connection from the theoretical to the commercial for VSIP in Java,
              while identifying operational modes and service requirements for this
              non-traditional programming environment. If successful, a large community of
              Java programmers in academic, industry, and government could be enabled, as
              well as the service recipients. 
     Standardization for platform
              independence is a critical issue for Internet applications. An advanced
              commercially DSP tool-kit would provide for a greater level of portability for
              signal-processing-intensive Internet applications. This would provide for
              better support for processing audio/visual information in valuable application
              settings. Embedded Java applications will make use of the tool-kit to provide
              advanced signal analysis capabilities with mobility, portability, and high
              quality.
