Abstract    :
              9860863
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
              the need for gas microsensors for application in the fields of emissions and
              environmental monitoring as well as medical applications by demonstrating the
              use of photochemical reactions to enhance the stability and selectivity of
              chemiresistive semiconducting metal oxide (SMO) thin film sensors.  In this
              sensor, the target gas interacts chemically with the sensing film and because
              it is a semiconducting film, very small chemical changes can cause a measurable
              change in the resistance of the film.  Although SMO gas sensing technology is
              promising because of the highly sensitive transduction mechanism, improvements
              in selectivity and stability are required before this technology will be
              practical for many applications.  An opportunity exists to make improvements in
              this technology by using light to replace or enhance the thermal energy
              currently being used to control surface reactions.
     In the private and
              government sectors there are many applications for both in situ gas sensors and
              gas sensors in control systems.  Future product development resulting from the
              research associated with this proposal could produce a reliable, in situ gas
              sensor for the detection and monitoring of numerous gases.
