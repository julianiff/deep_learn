Abstract    :
              9860335
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves
              the development of Proof-of-Concept geometric mathematical software tools for
              the incremental reconstruction and control of high quality surfaces and volumes
              generated from point cloud data. This new incremental technique will make it
              possible to process the millions of points that come from today's laser and
              optical scanners. The tools will incorporate novel methods for geometric
              modeling based on a combination of concepts from discrete geometry and topology
              and from combinatorial and numerical algorithms.  The proposed software tools
              will address two crucial needs in surface reconstruction: the need to deal with
              large point clouds automatically and efficiently, and the need to create high
              quality surfaces from large point clouds satisfying certain tolerance
              conditions. Raindrop Geomagic, Inc. will rely on its proven mathematical
              technology to implement a proposed solution that is more general, more
              efficient, and more rational than any of the previous approaches to the
              problem.
     The ability to accurately and automatically reconstruct or model
              the surface and volume of an object defined by a large, unstructured set of
              points has the potential to fundamentally impact a number of major economic
              sectors including the CAD/CAM, animation, and medical modeling
              industries.
