Abstract    :
              9860537
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate the feasibility of a novel non-destructive testing (NDT)
              technique/apparatus. The objective of this research is to develop a new
              capability for detecting minute cracks on the surface of structural components.
              Economic losses in the U.S. due to crack induced failure is estimated to exceed
              one billion dollars annually. A key step in reducing these losses is
              identifying cracks prior to catastrophic failure. This SBIR project will
              develop an NDT apparatus based on microwave heating and thermographic detection
              of cracks.  The experimental apparatus consists of a rectangular waveguide
              which is open on one end. The open end may be pressed against a metal surface,
              thereby forming a microwave resonant cavity. With this arrangement the
              component being inspected forms one wall of the resonant cavity. The normal
              boundary condition for electromagnetic fields within the cavity requires that
              electric field components diminish to zero at the cavity walls. In the presence
              of a crack, however, this boundarv condition no longer applies and microwaves
              will be emitted from eddies of the crack.
     NDT is widely used for
              evaluating infrastructure such as bridges, pipeline, boilers, and
              transportation equipment. Immediate applications exist for new NDT methods
              which offer functional/economic benefit.
