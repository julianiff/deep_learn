Abstract    :
              9860892
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
              the challenge of manufacturing biodegradable polymeric micro-spheres which
              provide prolonged, controlled release of drugs. The gas anitisolvent
              precipitation technique, which uses near- or supercritical carbon dioxide as an
              antisolvent to rapidly co-precipitate drugs from solutions in organic solvents,
              will be used in conjunction with hydrophobic ion pairing to manufacture
              micro-spheres in the correct size range for pulmonary or subcutaneous
              administration. Research objectives include understanding the mechanism by
              which particles are formed, scaling our current bench top process by 50x while
              maintaining desired particle size distributions, and improving particle
              collection schemes. Research will use both experimental and theoretical
              approaches to predict scaleup parameters and identify process bottlenecks.
              Potential commercial applications of this technology include inhalable
              controlled release preparations for ipratropium, a common therapeutic agent for
              the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a subcutaneous
              depot formulation for isoniazid, a therapeutic agent effective for tuberculosis
              prophylaxis
