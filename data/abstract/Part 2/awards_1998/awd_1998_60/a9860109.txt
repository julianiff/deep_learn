Abstract    :
              9860109
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes
              the use of in-line treatment for 
functionalization of commercial substrate
              surfaces. The treatment will consist of an appropriate combination of plasma
              treatment and acrylate coating, and is expected to functionalize the surface of
              commercial substrates, particularly packaging films, to readily accept and bond
              with solventless printing inks, thus reducing the need for solvent-based inks.
              Use of solvent-based inks resulted in a recent annual release of 36 1/2 million
              pounds of printing ink solvents (primarily toluene) to the atmosphere over the
              USA. Regulatory and community pressure to reduce the use of solvent-based inks
              as a pollution prevention measure is already a significant driving force and
              will only intensify in the future. Upon successful proof-of-concept in Phase I,
              Sigma Technologies has the necessary full scale production equipment in place
              to immediately proceed to the Phase II and Phase III follow-on efforts wherein
              the successful surface functionalization process can be applied to a commercial
              packaging film for subsequent lamination and market testing by a major
              packaging film producer who is a current client of Sigma Technologies.
     An
              inexpensive, in-line process to promote adhesion of solventless ink to
              commercial substrates is anticipated which will result in significant pollution
              prevention by reducing the dependence of the packaging industry on
              solvent-based inks.
