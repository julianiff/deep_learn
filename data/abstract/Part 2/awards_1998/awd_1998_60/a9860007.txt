Abstract    :
              9860007
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project's overall
              objective is to provide oxide coatings that resist deterioration in a high
              temperature oxidizing environment.  A new, innovative process is proposed that
              should form strongly adherent, high temperature, oxidation resistant coatings
              on steel alloys, iron and nickel superalloys, aluminides, and superalloy matrix
              composites.  Using this process, the firm has produced two  protective
              coatings, with coating-to substrate bond strength that has been measured to be
              in excess of 7.3 kgf/mm2 (over 10,000 psi), and which have been formed on three
              different aluminum containing alloy substrates.  Full testing to evaluate the
              integrity of these coatings will be performed in Phase I.  Planned Phase II
              work will continue that and include lifetime testing of the coatings in cyclic
              and static, high temperature oxidizing environments.
     These coatings have
              broad application in industry throughout the nation.  Products that utilize the
              firm's coatings, can achieve longer lifetimes because of the surface protection
              provided by the coatings.  Such longer product lifetimes translate directly to
              user dollar savings that would yield both national economic benefits and create
              products that are more competitive in foreign markets.
