Abstract    :
              9860967
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              identify and fabricate ferroelectric materials optimized for use as cathodes in
              high-current-density high-repetition-rate electron guns.  An iterative process
              of materials synthesis, electron emission measurement, and characterization and
              evaluation, after emission, will be used.  The focus will be on lead
              zirconate-titanate and related perovskites, and the work will explore tradeoffs
              between electrical and optical properties to obtain desired electron emission
              properties while minimizing degradation. This project was motivated by recent
              research demonstrating that ferroelectric cathodes using commercial
              ferroelectric materials that were optimized for transducer applications can
              produce current densities in excess of 30 Amperes per square centimeter at
              500,000 Volts, and can sustain an emission pulse (at 50,000 Volts) for a time
              in excess of 2 microseconds.  In Phase II, this proposer will fabricate
              specimens of the optimized materials in appropriate sizes and shapes for
              testing as cathodes of an electron gun.
     Ferroelectric cathodes will be
              high-brightness electron sources for high-power microwave tubes, for electron
              accelerators for radiation oncology and research, and for beam applications
              including low-pressure switches and flat-panel displays.
