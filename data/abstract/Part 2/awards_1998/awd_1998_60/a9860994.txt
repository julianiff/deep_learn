Abstract    :
              9860994
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from
              TimeDomain CVD Inc. will develop molecular layer chemical vapor deposition
              (MLCVD) processes and equipment for deposition of barrier metals, which are
              employed in IC manufacturing to prevent undesired interactions between layers. 
              MLCVD techniques for titanium and tantalum-based barrier metals required for Cu
              metallization will be developed.  The films deposited are intrinsically
              conformal, as well as intrinsically uniform in thickness across the substrate. 
              Processing capabilities arising from this work can be incorporated in the
              barrier modules of cluster deposition tools.
