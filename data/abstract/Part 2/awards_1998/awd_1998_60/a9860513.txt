Abstract    :
              9860513
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will elucidate and optimize the fundamental electrochemistry involved in a
              revolutionary  zinc-air Fuel Cell Battery (FCB) for operation in
              low-temperature environments.  This technology will be utilized in a 500-watt
              remote portable power system to be coupled with a wind or solar recharger in an
              automated system.  The FCB exhibits  greater energy- and power-density than
              other battery technologies and is easily transportable, while avoiding the fuel
              logistics of a gasoline-powered generator and being far more environmentally
              benign.  The FCB anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials and reaction
              pathways will be optimized for low-temperature performance.  This research will
              explore the electrochemistry of the zinc-air FCB and will make an important
              contribution to the global commercialization of this promising technology.
   
               This technology is scalable to any power output from watts to hundreds of
              kilowatts.  It is expected to provide  power for small electrical devices,
              scooters, snowmobiles, snowplows, and automobiles, as well as remote power
              systems during winter seasons and in the cold climates of North America,
              Northern Europe, Russia, and the Polar Regions.
