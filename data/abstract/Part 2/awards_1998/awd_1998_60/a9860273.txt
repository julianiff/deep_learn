Abstract    :
              9860273
     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a
              nanostructural fabrication process for the production of high strength,
              lightweight metal-polymer nanolaminate materials. A patented ultra high
speed
              polymer deposition process allows the formation of large area laminates with
              thousands of nanosize
metal and polymer layers. The polymer materials have
              high thermal and mechanical stability, and the metal
layers can be any of
              several materials, including Al, Ti, Ni, steel and SS. The proposed
              investigation will
systematically explore the limits of this new process with
              particular focus on the mechanical material
properties. In the Phase I work,
              lightweight materials such as Al will be processed into
              nanolaminate
composites and the effects of metal layer thickness and
              metal/polymer thickness ratio will be compared to
basic bulk material
              properties. The Phase II work will seek further optimization and in-depth
              testing of
materials for specific industrial applications.
     High
              strength, lightweight polymer-metal multi-layer composites may have a range of
              applications that
includes lightweight structural component for industrial,
              civil, and aeronautical applications, automotive
parts and electrical and
              electronic applications.
