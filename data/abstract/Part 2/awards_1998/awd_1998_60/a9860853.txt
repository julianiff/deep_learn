Abstract    :
              9860853  
     This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate a
              technology to make chemically selective ultra-sensitive absorption measurements
              using prepared fiber optic segments which can be used to monitor trace chemical
              concentrations in remote locations. The sensitivity of this new approach is
              hundreds of times greater than that which can currently be realized using
              conventional fiber optic probes, and can be arbitrarily increased by increasing
              the length of the sensing fiber. This proposal details the technical approach
              we will take in demonstrating the technique and describes the tests we will
              perform to show proof-of-principle.
     The commercial applications of the
              program technology will be in the monitoring and mapping of trace chemical
              species in ground water and storage facilities, as well as in chemical leak
              monitoring around chemical storage and production plants.  This Phase I work
              will demonstrate the potential of a new method of making remote fiber optic
              spectral concentration measurements of trace species, which is compatible with
              remote field operation. The technology will be developed for rapid and
              sensitive analysis in scientific and commercial applications.
