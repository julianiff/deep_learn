Abstract    :
              9860948
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will  develop novel material systems for rapid prototyping of fully dense
              titanium and titanium alloy shapes that are functionally qualified.  Using a
              unique blend of tri-modal passivated powders and polymer, the Direct Metal
              Fabrication (DMF) process can obtain a very high packing density in a Selective
              Laser Sintering (SLS) powder bed.  With supersolidus liquid phase sintering,
              the process can provide uniform shrinkage and a fully dense sintered part. 
              This approach makes possible the direct prototyping of high strength reactive
              materials such as titanium and its alloys.  Potentially, the technology may be
              extended to other types of reactive material systems and alloys.   Phase I will
              attempt to achieve reproducible baseline titanium and alloy properties in such
              components.
     A solid free form fabrication technique for titanium and its
              alloys has an estimated market of $ 1-2 billion dollars per year in the
              medical, sporting, golf clubs, and bicycle components for use as improved
              structural integrity prototypes. It is anticipated that this rapid prototyping
              technology will have extensive other applications in titanium as well as other
              reactive metals and alloys.
