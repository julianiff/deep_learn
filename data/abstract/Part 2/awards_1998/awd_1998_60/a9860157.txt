Abstract    :
              9860157
     Ultra-pure water is required for the semiconductor fabrication and
              pharmaceutical industries. One extremely important water quality parameter is
              dissolved organic carbon content. The electronics industry currently limits
              total organic carbon (TOC) content of semiconductor fabrication process waters
              to >10 ug/L. The majority of analytical instruments which are currently
              available to monitor TOC at these levels utilize specific conductance detection
              of the dissolved HC03-/CO2= species which result from the photo-oxidation or
              combined chemical oxidation and photo-oxidation of dissolved organics. We
              propose an investigation of methods which can be used to improve sensitivity of
              TOC monitoring instruments by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude by
              chemically amplifying the conductivity signal. The proposed technology is based
              upon the transport of C02, resulting from the oxidation of dissolved organic
              species, across a semipermeable membrane into a alkanolamine solution where
              ionic compounds are formed by chemical reaction with C02-.
     Successful
              development of a TOC detection methodology which provides substantially lower
              limits of detection than can be achieved using currently available
              instrumentation is expected to result in the design, manufacture, and marketing
              of an advanced generation of instruments for ultra-pure water characterization
              in support of semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries. The new detector
              will be suitable for use in both laboratory instruments and continuous flow
              process analyzers.
