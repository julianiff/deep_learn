Abstract    :
              9860678
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will investigate a two-wavelength imaging pyrometer, using an indium gallium
              sulfide (InGaS)-based camera, to monitor high-temperature materials processes. 
              The innovative two-wavelength imaging uses intensity ratios to provide accurate
              temperature measurement of objects with emissivity variation.   Single
              wavelength imaging sensors mistake absolute intensity changes, caused by
              emissivity variation, for temperature changes.  Temperature is a central
              parameter in many forms of high-temperature materials processing.  Temperature
              control over long production runs provides product consistency and uniformity
              at reduced manufacturing costs.   Phase I will design and construct a prototype
              two-wavelength, imaging pyrometer with InGaS camera and perform laboratory
              evaluations and tests in materials processing facilities of selected industrial
              and research organizations. 
     This thermal imaging sensor is expected to
              meet industrial needs for accuracy, high temperature operation, and low cost. 
              The developed thermal imaging sensor, with its 1-2 micron sensitivity, will
              find wide application to industrial needs for process control sensors for high
              temperature materials processing.
