Abstract    :
                  9808376  Duman  Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have now been identified in a
              number of poikilothermic (cold blooded) animals and plants.  The most active
              AFPs are found in certain insects, such as the overwintering larvae of the
              beetle Dendroides canadensis.  Dr. Duman has purified and characterized several
              of these proteins, and using recombinant DNA techniques he has cloned 13
              similar AFPs from this species.  The studies in this proposal will continue to
              ascertain the relationship between the structure and antifreeze function of the
              D. canadensis AFPs.  Also, the possibility that various structural differences
              in the 13 different beetle AFPs translate into functional variation in
              abilities of the AFPs to lower the freezing point of the hemolymph, prevent
              freezing initiated by outside ice across the surface of the insect, and/or
              promote supercooling will be determined.  Certain aspects of the antifreeze
              activity of the beetle AFPs can be substantially increased by certain protein
              and low molecular weight solutes such as succinate.  The mechanism of these
              enhancers will be investigated to understand how to optimize the activity of
              the AFPs.  Information provided by these studies will have a direct bearing on
              the numerous potential applications of these extremely active AFPs, such as
              expression of the insects AFP genes in plants.
