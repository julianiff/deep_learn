Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF)  will assist the Department of Chemistry of SUNY at Stony   Brook in
              acquiring a preparative ultracentrifuge.  The areas of chemistry   enhanced by
              the equipment include: (1) the design and characterization of   new magnetic
              contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, (2) the   synthesis of coenzyme
              A and palmitoyl-coenzyme A analogs, (3) the folding  of the ribosomal protein
              L9 and of the E3/E1P domain, (4) the role of   protein surface loops and hinges
              in the reactions catalyzed by   triosephosphate isomerase and the interfacial
              enzyme cholesterol oxidase,   (5) the binding site for fertilin-beta in its
              receptor, (6) the synthesis   of polyfunctional organosilanes as inhibitors of
              aspartic and   metalloproteases, (7) the study of the interfacial enzyme
              phospholipase D   and (8) the spectroscopic analysis of the molecular forces
              leading to   catalysis in the reactions catalyzed by enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase
              and   enoyl-acp reductase.  The instrument will also be used in two advanced  
              undergraduate laboratories.  Ultracentrifugation is a technique used   mainly
              to aid in the isolation and purification of proteins.  The   capability of
              chemists to carry out cutting edge research in bioorganic   chemistry  demands
              access to state-of-the-art preparative   ultracentrifuges.
