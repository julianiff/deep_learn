Drs. Cochran
              and Hatzes will continue the European Southern Observatory Planetary Survey, a
              high precision radial velocity survey to explore planetary environments beyond
              our solar system by detecting Jovian-mass planets in orbit around nearby solar-
              type stars. The survey will yield improved statistics on the fraction of
              solar-type stars with planetary systems, and the diversity of these systems. 
              This award is made through NSF's special competition for Life in Extreme
              Environments, with participation by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and
              the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical
              and Physical Sciences.
