Abstract    :
                  9808141  Claiborne  The fish gill is a multi-purpose organ.  Analogous to
              the lungs in land-dwelling animals, the gills allow the fish to breathe oxygen
              and excrete carbon-dioxide.  Further, the gills perform functions of the
              kidneys as they eliminate toxic metabolic acid from the animal.     Dr.
              Claiborne has hypothesized that saltwater fish may excrete acid using a family
              of sodium hydrogen exchanger proteins (NHE) within the gills.  These proteins
              were first discovered in mammals but our preliminary data indicate that they
              are also present in more primitive animals like fish.    The PI will
              investigate the genetic regulation and protein expression of the NHEs in the
              gills of two different marine species - the sculpin and the killifish.  This
              should provide new insight into the physiology of gill acid-base and ion
              regulation and shed new light on evolutionary relationships between the
              vertebrates.  Further, since it is known that the cellular mechanisms within
              the gills are similar to those currently being studied in the mammalian kidney,
              a new understanding of the physiology of the kidney and other organs may also
              be achieved.
