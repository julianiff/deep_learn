Abstract    :
                    9808791  Callis  This proposal will investigate the regulation of protein
              degradation in higher plants and examine the functional roles that the highly
              conserved proteolytic ubiquitin pathway serves in controlling plant growth
              processes.  The proposal will focus on the AUX/IAA family of proteins that are
              highly expressed in response to the plant hormone, auxin but rapidly degrade. 
              Major objectives of this proposal are to determine which amino acids constitute
              the degradation signal, to identify the proteolytic mechanisms involved in
              AUX/IAA degradation, and to isolate mutants defective in the degradation of the
              AUX/IAA proteins.  Another major objective of the proposal is to investigate
              the expression and function of RUB, a protein related to ubiquitin that is
              involved in auxin responses in plants.  Together, the proposed studies will
              elucidate how controlled proteolysis functions. in auxin and other signaling
              processes.  In addition, the work will increase our fundamental understanding
              of ubiquitin pathway function in eucaryotic organism.
