Abstract    :
                  9808729  Wang  Transduction of biotic and abiotic cues to the cell often
              requires the function of phospholipases.  Activation of Phospholipase D (PLD)
              generates second messengers and is involved in a broad range of cellular
              processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, reproduction,
              and defense responses.  The goals of this project are to understand the
              mechanisms by which PLDs exert their cellular effects and to identify cellular
              targets of PLD activation.  To elucidate the cellular activation of PLDs, this
              study will address if PLDs are regulated by phosphorylation and how different
              PLDs interact with and are stimulated by polyphosphoinositides.  To identify
              the downstream targets of PLD activation, this project will determine if
              protein physphorylation and reactive oxygen generation are altered in
              PLD-deficient transgenic Arabidopsis and if PLD activation affects other lipid
              signaling processes.  In addition, the role of PLD in the phytohormone,
              abscisic acid, response will be investigated.  Completion of this project will
              fill critical gaps in the current knowledge of PLDs and lipid-based signaling
              in plant growth and development.  This study may also identify novel ways to
              enhance seed germination and to decrease plant post-harvest and in-field
              losses.
