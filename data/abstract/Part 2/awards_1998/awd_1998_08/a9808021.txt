Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enhance the expression, secretion, and
              recovery of mammalian proteins from transgenic plant suspension cultures. 
              Various human lymphokines including human granulocyte-macrophage
              colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukins (IL-2,IL-4, and IL-10) are
              to be employed as model secreted transgenic proteins.  The expression of
              mammalian proteins in plant cells will be increased by using strong
              constitutive and inducible promoters, or by adding the non-translated leader
              sequence of the tobacco etch virus (TEV).  The targeting and secretion of
              transgenic proteins will be examined by adding various plant signal peptide
              sequences.  The effect of glycosylation on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
              targeting/retention sequences are to be investigated.  Protein recovery will be
              maximized through the testing of a variety of additives for their effectiveness
              in stabilizing secreted transgenic proteins.  A novel affinity chromotography
              bioreactor is to be developed that uses the nickel-chelate nitrilotriacetic
              
column to increase in situ production and separation of the secreted
              mammalian proteins from plant suspension cultures.
