Abstract    :
              Rank  9808835    The PIs will examine mechanisms of temperature adaptation in
              the leaf  beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis living in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, 
              California. The PIs have selected beetle populations living in three  drainages
              characterized by steep altitudinal and thermal gradients: Big  Pine Creek,
              Bishop Creek, and Rock Creek. The PIs will characterize the  thermal
              environment of these drainages and determine the body temperatures  of beetles
              living in a variety of microhabitats. Air temperatures will be  measured
              continuously over the summer at three altitudes per drainage. The  PIs will map
              sunny and shady habitats in each locality precisely. The PIs  will use digital
              thermometers equipped with micro-thermocouples to measure  the body
              temperatures of adult beetles and larvae over the course of the  summer: at a
              single location during the day, at different altitudes over  several days, and
              in sunny and shady sites in each locality. The PIs will  also quantify tissue
              levels of the heatstress inducible protein HSP70 in  beetles of known body
              temperature. Finally, the PIs will use enzyme  electrophoresis to characterize
              the populations genetically. These results  will allow us to quantify
              environmental temperature variation and the  beetles' response to it. Both
              field and laboratory portions of this project  will involve extensive
              participation of undergraduates.
