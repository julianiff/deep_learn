It has recently been demonstrated in this laboratory that
              epigenetic transcriptional inactivation occurs in algae as well as in higher
              plants. In Chlamydomonas, two mechanisms, namely chromatin/nuclear domains and
              DNA methylation, are hypothesized to be the responsible mechanisms. In order to
              test these working hypotheses, this project has the following specific aims: 1)
              To isolate tagged mutants defective in transcription gene silencing, 2) To
              clone and characterize a tagged gene(s) involved in transcription repression,
              and 3) To map the chromosomal location of silenced and stable transgenic
              loci.

The production of transgenic plants and animals is rapidly becoming
              routine, but the introduced genes are often unstably expressed, leading to the
              loss or reduced manifestation of newly acquired traits. This phenomenon of
              transgene silencing often results from a variety of epigenetic mechanisms,
              operating at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In most
              cases the underlying molecular processes have not been precisely identified.
              The results of this work could contribute to a greater understanding of
              epigenetic phenomena in eukaryotes, since preliminary data suggest that the
              molecular mechanisms might be evolutionarily conserved. The analysis of
              epigenetic gene silencing in Chlamydomonas can provide a genetic approach for
              understanding essential features of chromosomal/nuclear organization
              controlling gene expression. From a practical perspective, the results could
              contribute to the development of methods to overcome epigenetic silencing
              methodology, which could contribute to the generation of transgenic plants and
              animals.
