Abstract    :
                This project will consist in the recuration of scale  insect (COCCOIDEA)
              collection.  A large part of the  collection is from China and Southeast Asia,
              and  represents the world's largest collection of scale  insects and hosts
              plants from this region.  The entire  scale insect collection consists of
              50,000 glass slide-  mounted specimens, 200 primary types, 16,000 samples of 
              dried plant material with scale insects in situ, and 500  line drawings,
              correspondence, and field notebooks.  All of the scale insects and host plants
              are identified  to genus, and in most cases, species.  This collection  is of
              unique scientific value: the specimens are from  areas that can no longer be
              collected; both the scale  insects and the plant hosts are identified; all 
              developmental stages and parasites are often included;  and these dried
              specimens make ideal material for  molecular systematic studies.    For long
              term safekeeping of this invaluable resource,  four major curatorial needs must
              be addressed: placement  in acid-free containers, protection from insect pests,
               updating specimen taxonomy, and facilitation information  retrieval.  In many
              cases the specimens themselves are  in need of curatorial attention or of
              stabilization.  Additionally, the slide collection will be evaluated for 
              relabeling or remounting and will be bar coded.  The  majority of dried
              specimens on dried plant material are  housed in individual cardboard boxes,
              which are highly  acidic and must be replaced.  The enclosed specimens  need to
              be re-wrapped in buffered tissue for added  protection.  In addition, roughly
              3,000 dried specimens,  mostly from exotic locations, are  still housed in 
              various kinds of packaging just as they were received  through the mail.  These
              specimens need to be moved into  standard sized archival boxes like the rest of
              the  collection.  Each new box plus contents will be sealed  in plastic bags to
              eliminate damage by insect pests.
