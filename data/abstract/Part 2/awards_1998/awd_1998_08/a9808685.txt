This award supports research on new approaches to strongly 
              interacting many-body quantum systems with the aim of  elucidating the
              electronic properties of materials such as  the high temperature
              superconductors, related perovskite  ruthenates and nickelates, Bechgaard
              salts, and other  organic superconductors.  The PI intends to continue a 
              coordinated study of the properties of doped Mott  insulators. Specifically it
              is intended to investigate the  properties of conducting stripe ordered, stripe
              liquid, and  stripe liquid crystalline phases, the mechanism of high 
              temperature superconductivity in these phases, an most  ambitiously, to study
              the consequences of topological doping  for the anomalous normal state of "bad
              metals."  The PI  plans an approach that includes controlled approximate 
              solutions of microscopic models as well as developing more  phenomenological
              theory with the aim of understanding the  implications of experimental
              observations.  Specific plans  include: (1) studies of solvable electronic
              models which  exhibit stripe phases, (2) an investigation of the  consequences
              of fluctuations of the phase of the order  parameter on the properties of
              superconductors with low  superfluid densities, (3) studies to establish the 
              conditions for the stability of possible liquid crystalline  and isotropic
              liquid stripe phases, and to elucidate the  electronic properties of these
              phases.  %%%  This proposal involves new approaches to the study of  electronic
              properties of materials with strongly interacting  electrons; a challenging
              problem at the forefront of  condensed matter theory.  The role of  `striped
              phases' and  superconducting fluctuations in high temperature  superconductors
              are a focus of this work.  ***
