Abstract    :
              Abstract  9808785  Riedel  Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important
              hormone that controls cell growth and cell movement.  PDGF acts by binding to
              and thereby activating a specific cell surface PDGF receptor.  This activated
              receptor then attracts several intracellular proteins into a signaling complex.
              Preliminary studies from this laboratory suggest that a recently discovered
              growth factor receptor binding protein (Grb10) participates in this signaling
              complex and specifically in the cell growth stimulatory signal initiated by the
              PDGF receptor activation. The goals of this study are to determine how Grb10
              functions in the PDGF receptor signaling complex and how it affects cell
              growth.  A combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology
              methods will be employed in the  experiments. Initially the site at which Grb10
              binds to the PDGF receptor and how the latter is activated will be determined 
              The interaction of Grb10 with other proteins in  the signaling complex will be
              established and studies will look at how it affects the function of these
              proteins.  These studies will elucidate an unexplored mechanism in an important
              signaling pathway which occurs in many cell types.  These results may also
              contribute information about other signaling pathways involved in the control
              of cell growth.  This research is studying a recently discovered protein,
              growth factor receptor binding protein (Grb10) which is involved in the
              signaling complex initiated by the activation of the platelet growth factor
              receptor(PDGF). These studies will examine the mechanism of action of this
              factor in an important signaling pathway of many cell types, and may provide
              information about other signaling pathways involved in cell growth.
