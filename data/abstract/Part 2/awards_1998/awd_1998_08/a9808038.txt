Abstract    :
              Although gender equality in higher education has been identified as an important
              goal by governments and organizations throughout the world, prevailing patterns
              of educational gender stratification have not yet been systematically examined
              in a comparative context. The proposed research aims to describe and to explain
              historical and international differences in women's representation in higher
              education in advanced industrial societies. Three distinct dimensions of
              equality will be considered: (1) overall female representation in tertiary
              education; (2) gender distributions across tertiary sectors (e.g.,
              universities, two-year colleges, vocationally-oriented training institutes);
              and (3) gender distributions across programs of study. The first objective is
              to describe historical and cross-national variability with respect to these
              three dimensions. Although it is well known that women's overall tertiary
              enrollment has increased worldwide in recent decades, international trends in
              sectoral and programmatic gender segregation have not yet been rigorously
              examined. The second objective is to account for the observed patterns of
              cross-national variability. Three sets of explanatory variables will be
              considered: (1) structural features of the national educational system; (2)
              structural features of the economy; and (3) the prevailing ideological climate,
              or degree of gender egalitarianism characterizing the national culture.  
              Analyses will cover 24 advanced industrial societies during the period between
              1950 and 1995. The aggregate-level international and historical data employed
              are superior, in terms of comprehensiveness, level of detail, and
              comparability, to those used in any other previous research of this type. The
              project is also distinguished by its application of new log-linear modeling
              techniques to supplement traditional methodological approaches and measurement
              models. This approach mitigates conceptual and methodological difficulties that
              have long hampered comparative stratification research.
