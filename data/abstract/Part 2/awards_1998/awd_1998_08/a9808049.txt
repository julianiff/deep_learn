Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities  (CRIF)
              Program  will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University  of Oregon
              to upgrade a time-resolved laser pump/probe apparatus in the  Shared Laser
              Facility (SLF).   The new equipment will be used to perform  time-resolved
              studies of solvent cage effects in organometallic radical chemistry, of
              nonequilibrium solvation dynamics, and one- and two-photon fluorescence
              spectroscopy of proteins.

Lasers can provide important information about
              chemical reactivity.  Laser techniques may enable breakthroughs in our
              understanding of the properties of reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules.
