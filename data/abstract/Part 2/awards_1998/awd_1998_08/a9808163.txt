Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-980816      HOBBS, PETER  UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON    The PI
              proposes to conduct an airborne measurement program designed to examine the
              role of clouds on heat adsorption and radiation, and to measure the spectral
              reflectivity of ice floes in the Arctic Ocean.  Clouds properties and
              reflectance of radiation from the ice surface both influence climate feedback
              mechanisms.  The field program will be conducted in conjunction with the
              Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project in the Beaufort Sea. 
              Airborne measurements will be combined with measurements taken at the SHEBA
              station on the ice to examine the effects of the ocean-atmosphere-ice system on
              climate.  The SHEBA results will be used to improve global circulation models
              used to predict climate response to changing environmental conditions.
