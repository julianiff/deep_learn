The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at the University of Chicago supports a broad research program carried out in
              three interdisciplinary research groups and exploratory seed projects, as well
              as a wide range of educational activities, including the K-8 Partners in
              Science Program with outreach to Chicago area public schools.  The Center is
              raising public awareness of materials science through a new partnership with
              Chicago's Museum of Science and Technology.  The Center supports well
              maintained shared experimental facilities, which are accessible to outside
              users and also supports interactive efforts with industry and other sectors. 
              

One of the three interdisciplinary research groups is exploring the
              self-assembly of ultra-small structures.  The materials of interest include
              polymer films, colloids, and semiconductor nanocrystals.  A second group is
              carrying out experimental and theoretical studies of certain physical
              properties of solids with broad implications for an improved understanding of
              the condensed state of matter.  The properties include quantum phases,
              transitions, and fluctuations of complex systems.  The materials of interest
              include disordered ferromagnets, organic conductors and conducting polymers. 
              The third group studies macroscopic motion in granular materials and liquids. 
              Potential applications of these problems can be found in the construction of
              highways and dams, movement of grain and coal, design of ink jet printers,
              turbulence, avalanches, and bubble formation.  A seed initiative on molecular
              overlayers examines fundamental issues in the surface properties of molecular
              overlayers, including self-assembled monolayers.  A second seed initiative on
              bio-interfacial science is concerned with understanding the properties of
              interfaces in biological environments.  This knowledge is important for the
              design of implants, cell culture and preservation, and the construction of
              sensors that combine biological and engineered components.  

Participants in
              the Center currently include 26 senior investigators, 7 postdoctoral
              associates, 20 graduate students, 14 undergraduates, and 9 technicians and
              other support personnel.   Professor Steven J. Sibener directs the MRSEC.
