Abstract    :
              9808301  Gavin    Myosins are molecular motors that catalyze intracellular
              linear spatial displacement along actin microfilaments.  Examples of
              myosin-based motility include the contraction of muscle cells and cytokinesis
              (the cleavage of a cell into two during cell division).  A wide range of types
              of non-muscle myosin proteins have been discovered, although the specific
              functions of the various types or classes of myosins have not yet been fully
              elucidated.  The Principal Investigator's laboratory recently demonstrated the
              existence of two new members of the myosin superfamily in the ciliated
              protozoan, Tetrahymena. These are the first myosins to be discovered in
              ciliated protozoa.  One of these, Myo1p, is a novel unconventional myosin that
              may be the founding member of a new myosin class.  The other, p180, exhibits a
              novel localization to actin microfilaments at the bases of the motile cilia,
              which raises the intriguing possibility that a myosin might integrate
              interactions between microtubules and microfilaments.  Tetrahymena is amenable
              to genetic manipulation and is an excellent experimental organism for studies
              of protein function in vivo.  The goals of this project are to complete the
              cloning and sequencing of MYO1, to clone and sequence the cDNA for p180, to
              identify the subcellular location(s) of these myosins, and to determine their
              function(s) in Tetrahymena.  Antibodies will be raised against each myosin,
              based on predicted amino acid sequences.  These antibodies will be used for
              immunolocalization studies as well as for functional studies.  Function will
              also be assessed by genomic knockouts.  If myosins are involved in
              microtubule-microfilament synergy, as for example, regulation of ciliary
              activity at the level of the basal body, the results of this work may well have
              implications not only for motility in ciliated protozoa but for ciliary
              activity in vertebrate cells as well.
