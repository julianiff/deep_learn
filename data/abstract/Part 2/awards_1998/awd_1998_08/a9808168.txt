Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University   of Oregon
              to acquire a computer-controlled thermal analysis system.  The   system
              includes modulated differential scanning calorimetry,   thermogravimetric
              analysis coupled to a mass spectrometer and a central   computer controller
              with data analysis software.  The instrument will be   used in a wide range of
              research areas involving polymeric materials and   solid state structures
              including: formation of carbon-rich polymers,   transformations in
              photodegradable polymers, evolution of sol-gel   precursors to crystalline
              solids, production of nanocrystals and of   `unnatural` crystal morphologies,
              and reactions in the solid state to   produce kinetic-controlled products.   
              Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal analysis technique   which
              measures the temperatures and heat flows associated with   transitions in
              organic, inorganic and polymeric materials as a function   of time and
              temperature.  The data obtained provide qualitative  and   quantitative
              information on physiochemical changes that involve   exothermic or endothermic
              processes, or changes in heat capacity.
