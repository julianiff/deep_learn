Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at North   Carolina State
              University to acquire a nanosecond time resolution,   step-scan
              Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer bench with FTIR   microscope and
              attenuated total reflection (ATR) attachment.  Step-scan   FTIR spectroscopy
              will be used to observe enzyme intermediates in novel   dehalogenating enzymes
              and structural dynamics that accompany electron   transfer in iron-sulfur
              dendrimers, to determine time scales for   substrate interactions with enzyme
              binding sites and for conformation   changes in the flexible framework of
              halozeotype micropores.  FTIR in ATR   mode will be used to measure the
              vibrational spectrum of opaque crystals   and polymers.    Fourier-transform
              infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has become a very powerful   tool in recent years.
               Improvements in the stability and reproducibility   of interferometers have
              resulted in significantly improved sensitivity in   FTIR spectrometers.  New
              FTIR sample geometries, including grazing   incidence and attenuated total
              reflection spectroscopy, have increased   the repertoire of samples to include
              opaque crystals, surfaces and   polymers.
