Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry   at the
              University of Delaware to acquire a matrix-assisted laser   desorption
              ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. This   equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the   following:  (1) copolymer
              characterization, (2) secondary structural   analysis of oligonucleotides, (3)
              bond-selective photodissociation in   proteins, (4) laser desorption/ionization
              experiments using subthreshold   pulse energies, (5) molecular dynamics studies
              of the   desorption/ionization process, (6) homopolymer desorption and  
              cationization mechanisms, (7) quantitative analysis of natural and   synthetic
              polymers, and (8) IR-MALDI using ice as a matrix.  Mass   spectrometry (MS) is
              a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules.  It affords the   chemist one of the most powerful
              tools available for the characterization   of compounds. The acquisition of
              enhanced capability in mass spectrometry   is essential for the prosecution of
              frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.
