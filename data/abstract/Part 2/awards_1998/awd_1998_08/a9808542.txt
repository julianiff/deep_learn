This grant is for a
              coordinated international effort which combines laboratory, numerical and field
              investigation to address an important engineering problem in coastal
              hydraulics: the proper design and operation of coastal structures that will
              absorb the wave energy and minimizing overtopping.  The integration of these
              research efforts has been carefully planned.  It is expected that the resulting
              validated numerical model will find utilization by design engineers.  Should
              this result, the contribution to the nation's wealth will readily justify the
              allocated support.
