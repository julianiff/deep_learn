Abstract    :
              9808430  Gold  The overall aim of this project is to further understanding of
              manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the
              lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.  The specific
              objectives are to characterize the structures, mechanisms, and functions of
              these enzymes.  Using a homologous expression system developed by the PI, they
              plan to construct, express, and characterize several site-directed mutants of
              MnP.  These include several mutations at Arg177, an amino acid residue which
              interacts with the Mn ligand Glu35, and additional mutations of Mn bindidng
              site residues.  They will determine the effects of these mutations on the
              function of MnP.  They also plan to continue to characterize  MnP Phe190
              mutants by biophysical methods and to construct and characterize MnP Phe45
              mutants.  To better understand how LiP oxidizes polymeric lignin, the LiP
              oxidation of a lignin model polymeric substrate, ribonuclease, will be
              examined.  In particular, the role of veratryl alcohol in this reaction will be
              examined. Using a series of dimethoxybenzyl alcohol LiP substrates, the PI will
              determine the requirements for forming and stablizing cation radical
              intermediates in the LiP reaction.    Lignocellulose comprises-95% of
              terrestrial biomass, and the presence of lignin greatly retards the microbial
              breakdown of cellulose; thus, lignin plays a key role in the earth's carbon
              cycle and is central to a wide variety of biotechnologies for biomass
              utilization.  This proposal focuses on several unresolved questions concerning
              the structures and mechanisms of the fungal enzymes which are chiefly
              responsible for catalyzing lignin biodegradation in nature.  The proposed work
              has important ecological and biotechnological applications.
