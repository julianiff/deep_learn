	This project develops new algorithms to take
              advantage of high-resolution spatial, spectral and temporal data sets-images
              obtained by remote sensing of forests.  This project has three objectives. 
              First, a new "ground truth" forest plot in the rich, mixed mesophytic forest is
              located and mapped.  Second, using state-of-the-art sensors, images of the
              ground truth plot are sampled to obtain imagery with very high spatial,
              spectral and temporal resolution.  The goal of this part of the study is to
              collect data of unusually high quality and resolution in anticipation of the
              capabilities of future broad-area sensors.  The third goal of the project is to
              evaluate the ability of existing and new algorithms to segment and identify
              individual tree canopies.  
	The ability to segment and identify individual
              trees from images obtained by remote sensing will, in turn, (1) permit improved
              forest community classification, (2) contribute to parameterization and
              validation of individual-based population and community models of diverse
              forest communities and their responses to global or regional environmental
              change, (3) aid in assessment of forest ecosystem health and changes in forest
              health, and (4) open new possibilities for bioprospecting for rare individuals
              of either detrimental or beneficial species of special concern.
