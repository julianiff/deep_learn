Abstract    :
              9808040  Liu  The PI proposes to complete the construction of a retinal 
              prosthesis designed to provide artificial vision to people  blind due to the
              degeneration of retinal rod and cones,  experienced in diseases such as
              retinitis pigmentosa and age-  related macular degeneration.  The prosthesis is
              divided  into two parts, one outside of the eye to acquire, code, and  transmit
              an image, and the other inside the eye to receive  and decode image data, and
              then apply the requested  stimulation pattern to the retina.  The system design
              must  minimize power consumption and be biocompatible.    The external portion
              consists of a special pair of glasses  onto which is mounted a mini-camera,
              video-capture circuit,  and power and video-data transmission circuit. 
              Electrical  power is transmitted wirelessly to the electronics in the  eye
              using a two wire-coil arrangement similar to a  transformer.    Inside the eye,
              a chip has been designed to stimulate the  retina in such a way as to form a
              20x20 pixel image.  This  chip receives it's power and video-data wirelessly
              from a  transmitter on the glasses.  The improved version of this  chip should
              be capable of sending operating-status back to  the glasses for monitoring. 
              Chip specifications are based  on preliminary biological testing at Johns
              Hopkins.    Biological testing of the prosthesis will take place at  Johns
              Hopkins University, using dogs that are blind due to a  genetic disorder that
              causes rod/cone loss similar to RP in  humans.  ***
