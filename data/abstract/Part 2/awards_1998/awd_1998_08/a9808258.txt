Abstract    :
              This project provides opportunities for presentation and participation at the
              ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Symposium. 
              The presenters will be recipients of National Science Foundation Division of
              Undergraduate Education (NSF_DUE) funding grants.    This project will
              provide/supplement travel funds to participants to the SIGCSE Technical
              Symposium in February 1998.  The SIGCSE Symposium is an international
              conference held annually in the United States, and it is one of the few
              dedicated solely to issues of undergraduate computing education.  The
              conference attracts over 700 educators from primarily the United States and
              Canada with a growing worldwide participation.  The conference features five
              parallel tracks of refereed papers, panels, and seminars over a two and a half
              day period, with additional opportunities for workshops before and after the
              technical sessions.  The technical sessions and workshops cover a wide variety
              of current topics such as:  *recent innovations in curriculum development 
              *samples of specific course materials and presentation  *issues in educational
              research and pedagogy
