Abstract    :
                                     PROJECT SUMMARY      The Michigan State University
              Herbarium (MSC) lichen  collection has the potential to serve as one of the
              best  resources in the world for lichenologists. The collections  number
              approximately 145,000 and include many very important  sets of exsiccatae
              totaling over 13,000 specimens and dozens  of type specimen.  However, the main
              strength of the  collection is its extensive geographic coverage, especially 
              areas of the temperate Southern Hemisphere and subantarctic  regions, Caribbean
              Islands, and temperate and alpine regions  of North America. The Southern
              Hemisphere collections  include many islands that have rarely, if ever, been 
              collected. Only recently have the general collections become  widely available
              to the lichen community, and many of the  most important fioristic collections
              are still unavailable  because they have not yet been processed. The MSU
              herbarium  staff lacks sufficient time to process these 55,000  specimens and
              there is not sufficient space to integrate  them into the collections.  This
              project will:                                install a compactor system to     
               alleviate space problems, facilitate curation of the       collection, and
              minimize damage due to crowded storage       conditions;         process
              current backlog of 55,000 specimens and make  them available to      
              lichenologists for study.
