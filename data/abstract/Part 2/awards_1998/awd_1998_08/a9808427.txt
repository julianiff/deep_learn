Abstract    :
              9808427  Jameson  The object of this research is to improve the understanding of
              subunit interactions and conformational dynamics of ribosomal "stalk" proteins,
              both isolated and associated with other ribosomal components.  The specific
              systems to be studied include the Escherichia. coli ribosomal proteins L7/L12
              and L10, free and reconstituted into ribosomal subunits and the yeast
              eukaryotic proteins YPO, YP2( and YP1(. Cysteine residues, specifically placed
              at appropriate locations within these proteins by site-directed mutagenesis
              techniques, will be labeled with sulfhydryl specific fluorescence probes. 
              Fluorescence methods, including both steady-state and time-resolved
              anisotropies, will then be utilized to characterize the rotational properties
              of different domains of these proteins, free in solution and incorporated into
              ribosomes.  These latter studies will be aimed at elucidating thermodynamic
              aspects of the dimer/monomer equilibria as well as studying subunit exchange
              between dimers free in solution and in the various complexes.    The ribosome
              is the cellular organelle that makes new proteins and hence is essential to the
              proper functioning of the cell and to life.  These studies will help to provide
              a better understanding of how the various parts of the ribosome move as they
              carry out their biological function.  The training aspects of the research
              program will also help to develop human resources.
