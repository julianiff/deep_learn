              Topological Localization without Explicit Localization    Localization is
              crucial to the realistic implementation of sensor based exploration, which is a
              task that enables a robot to explore and build a map of an unknown environment.
              The robot needs localization to determine if it is exploring new territory or
              re-encountering an already mapped region.  First, the proposed work suggests a
              new map, termed the topological Voronoi graph, which only stores the nodes,
              adjacency relationships between the nodes, and the distance between nodes of
              the generalized Voronoi graph structure. Instead of using complicated sensor
              and encoder error models to determine the robot's location, the robot exploits
              the topology and geometry of the topological Voronoi graph to determine its
              location in this graph, and thus infer its location in the work space.    This
              method is theoretically well founded and simpler to implement than conventional
              methods. Furthermore, the proposed method extends into any dimensioned space
              where conventional methods are computationally intractable.    The proposed
              work will be demonstrated in a 10,000 square feet area. The Post-doctoral
              candidate, having mastered the Voronoi graph approach, will bring his vast
              experience in mobile robot programming.
