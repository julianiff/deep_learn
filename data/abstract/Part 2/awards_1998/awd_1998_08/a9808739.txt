Abstract    :
              9808739

The aim of this project is to design. implement and optimize a system
              enabling taxono-mists, conservation biologists. and decision-makers to access
              large quantities of data regarding the distribution and diversity of birds
              based on data from systematic collections and observational data sets. It will
              be composed of three geographically separated func-tional subsystems The first
              subsystem at the University of Kansas (KU) still allows man-agement of and
              access to integrated data housed in five large. geographically separate
              databases in institutions in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The second
              subsystem at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, will permit user-designed
              analysis and visualiza-tion of results from the data subsystem using a GIS
              database. The third, Java-based sub-system, situated on users' machines, will
              perform GIS mapping using results from the first two subsystems. The system
              builds on an existing database and map server developed at KU and the
              Biodiversity Insight System developed at SDSC. Open protocols such as Z39.50
              and CGI will be used throughout to ensure scalability to additional databases
              and other taxa. allowing the system to encompass many additional sources of
              data.
