Abstract    :
                      9808792  Jones  Dr. Jones has recently obtained molecular genetic
              evidence that auxin-binding protein I (ABP1) is an auxin receptor that mediates
              auxin-regulated growth and cell wall formation.  Constitutive expression of
              maize ABP1 in maize cell lines causes increases in both cell size and wall
              thickness.  Furthermore, inducible expression of arabidopsis ABP1 in tobacco
              causes increased growth as measured in leaf explants.  Consistent with receptor
              function, the ABP1 effect in both systems is strictly dependent on auxin.  The
              molecular mechanism by which ABP1 causes increase in growth is not known and is
              the topic of investigation for this proposal.  Based on its subcellular
              distribution, the PI hypothesizes that the ABP1-auxin complex triggers a change
              in the control of rate and/or direction of flow of wall precursors and/or
              growth-limiting factors through the endomembrane pathway or alters the sorting
              and activity of wall precursors or their biosynthetic enzymes.  To test this
              hypothesis, the PI will investigate auxin-regulated cell and tissue growth,
              auxin uptake, and polar auxin transport will be assessed in arabidopsis and
              tobacco plants and explants that have both increased and decreased levels on
              ABP1.    This proposal addresses a central question in plant cell biology,
              growth, and development: How does auxin regulate plant growth?  The signal
              transduction pathway delineated by auxin and ABP1 is certainly only part of
              multiple pathways that lead to cell expansion but all the evidence so far
              indicate that it is novel.
