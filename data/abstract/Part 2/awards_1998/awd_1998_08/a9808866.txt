Abstract    :
              LAY ABSTRACT  IBN 9808866    The circadian clock that controls daily rhythms of
              many bodily functions  and behaviors can be reset in by vigorous exercise.
              Whether or not the  clocks reset depends on the time of day and intensity of
              the exercise.  This project will focus on the behavioral and neural mechanisms 
              underlying this response. Because not all individuals show the response,  the
              first part of the project will develop criteria to predict which  animals show
              activity-induced resetting. Next, an artificial selection  study will be
              conducted to create a line of hamsters enriched with  animals that show
              resetting. This enriched line will then be used to map  regions of the brain
              that are activated during resetting. This will be  followed by experiments that
              examine the involvement of GABA, a  neurotransmitter in a part of the brain -
              the geniculohypothalamic tract  - that has previously been implicated in
              activity-induced resetting. The  results of this study will enhance our
              understanding of the process of  clock resetting in the mammalian brain.
              Furthermore, the participation  of undergraduate students in this project will
              provide them with  valuable hands-on learning experiences that will complement
              and extend  their standard course work.
