Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to identify the components of leaf vascular pattern formation,
              using a molecular genetic approach in Arabidopsis. The formation of the leaf
              vascular pattern has developmental consequences beyond the simple siting of
              veins. The developing veins of the leaf primordium appear to serve as
              morphogenetic centers that organize spatially much if not most of the
              differentiating leaf cell types. This makes functional sense, since many of the
              cell types must function in cooperation with the veins, requiring a defined
              spatial relationship. However, little is understood of the basis of the
              vascular pattern formation process, and both descriptive and experimental work
              is needed. Based on preliminary studies, vascular patterning is subject to
              genetic manipulation, in some but not all cases with effects on leaf
              morphology. This project includes the following three aims:

1. Characterize
              four existing molecular markers for provascular cells in leaf primordia 

2.
              Use a cell ablation strategy to address whether the developing vascular pattern
              directly influences leaf morphology and cell differentiation (as the PI
              hypothesizes) or whether vascularization accomodates leaf shapes and cell
              patterns created by other means

3.   Determine the roles of genes identified
              by existing and new vascular patterning mutants
