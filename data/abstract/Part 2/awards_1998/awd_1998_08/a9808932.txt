Abstract    :
              Jensen
The work addresses mechanisms of salinity tolerance in higher plants.
              Previous results showed that activation of inositol biosynthesis constitutes
              one essential aspect of a plant's adaptive response to excess sodium influx.
              The investigators concentrate on two aspects, of biochemical characterization
              of the enzymes of the pathway and the flux through the pathway in stressed
              plants and inositol transport. They will obtain a complete description of the
              metabolic flux that is necessary to sustain inositol concentrations high enough
              for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and signaling molecules which
              utilize inositol. The characterization of a recently detected sodium/inositol
              symporter protein, its expression characteristics and response to salt stress
              signaling, will be pursued. Data indicate that sodium-inositol co-transport
              might be the mechanism that synchronizes photosynthesis (carbon fixation),
              growth and sodium uptake. This aspect of work has the potential of changing a
              dogma held by plant physiologists, assuming sodium/proton antiport as a
              tolerance mechanism.  That the inositol-dependent uptake of sodium into the
              leaves is the controlling factor in salt stress tolerance.
