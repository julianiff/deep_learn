Abstract    :
              In everyday life, people judge and make decisions about events that will take
              place either in the relatively near or distant future. Examples include
              decisions about future education, jobs, close relationships, and health-related
              events. This program of research investigates how temporal distance from future
              events influences judgments and decisions regarding those events. It is
              hypothesized that people will use more abstract thinking when considering
              distant future events than when considering near future events. As a result,
              judgments and decisions regarding distant future events are more likely to be
              based on relatively general, superordinate, and decontextualized features,
              whereas judgments and decisions regarding near future events are more likely to
              be based on relatively specific, subordinate, and contextualized features of
              the events. A series of experiments will test this hypothesis and its
              implications for time-dependent changes in information processing, predictions,
              and preferences regarding future events. The findings are expected to identify
              advantages and disadvantages of decisions at different points in time, and will
              ultimately help us understand and improve the way people think, plan, and make
              choices about their future.
