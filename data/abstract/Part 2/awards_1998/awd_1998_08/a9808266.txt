Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse   University to
              upgrade two high resolution, 300 MHz and 500 MHz,  nuclear   magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectrometers.  This equipment will enhance   research in a number of
              areas such as the following: (1) Isotope labeling   of hydrocarbons for study
              of organic reaction mechanisms, (2) the study   of RNA and DNA structure and
              dynamics, (3) the preparation of   intermediates for the synthesis of
              macrolides and other natural products,   (4) the synthesis, structure
              determination and reactivity of organo   alkaline earth derivatives, (5) the
              synthesis of boron cluster compounds,   and (6) the preparation of oxovanadium
              and oxomolybdenum compounds.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances,
              characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study
              the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
