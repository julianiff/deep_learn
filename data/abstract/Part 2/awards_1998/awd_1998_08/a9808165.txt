Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Clemson   University  to
              upgrade a rotating anode-based X-ray diffraction analysis   system by
              replacement of the serial detector with a CCD area detector.      The equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas such as the   following: (1) the
              chemistry of fluoropolymer superacids which have   important applications in
              fuel cell membranes, (2) the synthesis and   characterization of complex metal
              sulfides , (3) the preparation of metal   oxides, nitrides, and sulfides in
              novel media such as geothermal brine.    The instrumentation will also be used
              in the teaching of X-ray   crystallography techniques to a large number of
              students. 

CCD detectors   allow large sections of the X-ray diffraction
              pattern of a crystal to be   measured at once and provide a powerful tool for
              the study of very small   and weakly diffracting materials.  Such systems are
              especially useful in   applications related to materials chemistry.
