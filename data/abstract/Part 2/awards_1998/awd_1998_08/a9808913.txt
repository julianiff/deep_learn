Abstract    :
                Receptor kinases (RKs) play an important role in the mechanism with which
              organisms perceive and respond to environmental signals, regulating growth and
              development in both animals and plants.  The long-germ goal of this  project is
              to elucidate the signal transduction cascade regulated by plant RKs.  With the
              cloning of the rice disease resistance gene, Xa21, conferring resistance to
              Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae(Xoo) (Song et al., 1995), this laboratory is in an
              excellent position to elucidate the molecular basis of RK mediated disease
              resistance in plants.  Xa21 encodes a receptor-like kinase carrying a presumed
              glycosylated leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain, a single pass transmembrane
              domain, and a serine threonine kinase (STK domain).  Based on the sequence of
              the Xa21 gene product (XA21) and information from receptor kinases in bacterial
              and animal systems, it is proposed that the LRR domain of the XA21 protein is
              extracellular and interacts with a ligand.  Ligand binding induces a
              conformational change in the protein, activates the intracellular kinase
              domain, triggers a downstream defense response and restricts pathogen growth. 
              In support of this model it has been demonstrated that the kinase domain is
              capable of autophosphorylation and that the LRR domain is sufficient for
              race-specific recognition.  The specific objectives of this research are to: 
              1. Define the sub-cellular localization of the XA21 protein and 2. Clone the
              Xoo encoded avirulence gene (avrXa21).    Accomplishment of these objectives
              will not only lead to the characterization of the determinants specifying
              disease resistance in the rice Xa21/avrXa21 interaction but will expand our
              knowledge of RK mediated signal transduction in plants.  Information gained
              from these studies will facilitate the development of environmentally safe
              strategies for disease control in rice and other agronomically important crops.
