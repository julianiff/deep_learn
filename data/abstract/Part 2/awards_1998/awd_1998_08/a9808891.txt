This award renews support of efforts to define effective methods
              for cryopreservation of a large variety of single-celled algae (microalgae)
              including over 2000 strains found in the UTEX collection of freshwater algae
              directed by the principal investigator of this award.  Such microalgae are used
              for basic research in genetics, ecology and physiology, and for varied
              commercial purposes. Development of reliable methods for their cryopreservation
              will eliminate the need for maintenance of strains through serial culture
              techniques.  Serial culture techniques are costly and, as importantly, permit
              the genetic makeup of the strains to change over time, thereby limiting their
              usefulness for some types of research.  Thus the development of reliable
              cryopreservation methods is of scientific as well as economic importance to the
              researchers and others who use microalgae.  Progress to date suggests that well
              over 50% of the strains in the UTEX collection can be cryopreserved.  Work
              supported through this work will allow completion of the testing of the
              collection and additional efforts aimed at development of new methods for
              dealing with those strains so far refractory to existing cryopreservation
              methodology.
