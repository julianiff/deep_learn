Abstract    :
              Luce   Experimental studies and attempts by decision analysists to use extant
              models to predict people's behavior for decisions involving mixed consequences
              of both gains and losses have not been very successful.  Examples where trouble
              has been seen is in medical decision making.  Because of the great importance
              of such applications, it is urgent that better models be developed and tested. 
              Recent theoretical work by the PI has shown why the troubles may arise.  He has
              shown under very plausible, empirically testable conditions that the
              computations one should use considerably more complex expressions than the
              weighted averages of utilities of  consequences that are commonly employed. 
              Indeed, he derived two distinct mathematical forms from slightly different
              assumptions.  One goal of the project is to pit these assumptions against one
              another directly and to see empirically which is more accurate.  Also, attempts
              will be made to determine whether these new expressions actually provide
              improved predictions of observed behavior.  Some numerical fitting will be
              based on existing data, but considerable additional data are needed for more
              thorough-going tests.  The PI will continue to develop the area theoretically. 
              In particular, he will focus considerable attention on the form of the
              weighting functions whose properties as far less specified than are those of
              the utility function.
