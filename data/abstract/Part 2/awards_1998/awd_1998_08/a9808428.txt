Abstract    :
                    9808428  Murray  Gap junctions between adrenal gland cells may provide a
              passageway for movement of regulatory molecules involved in adrenal function. 
              Dr. Murray will test the hypothesis that gap junctions between adjacent adrenal
              cells participate in adrenal gland function and that gap junction expression is
              dependent on the functional state of the adrenal gland.    Mice will be treated
              with compounds and/or procedures known to influence adrenal cell proliferation,
              steroidogenesis and morphology.  Specifically, the effect of
              adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), dexamethasone, low sodium diet, hypophysectomy and
              adrenal regeneration on gap junctions will be studied in vivo (Objective 1). 
              Adrenal glands from each of these treatment groups will be harvested for
              further study in cell culture (Objective 2).  Transgeneic (lack Cx43 gap
              junction protein) mouse adrenal glands will e transplanted into adult mice. 
              Adrenal gland viability, growth, steroidogenesis and cell proliferation will be
              measured in the adrenal transplants which either have or lack gap junctions
              (Objective 3).  The protocols described are expected to increase our knowledge
              of the role of gap junctions in hormone responses.  This information is
              critical to our understanding not only of hormone response in the adrenal gland
              but also to a general understanding of organ development, differentiation, and
              growth.
