Abstract    :
                                    ABSTRACT        Miami University and the Willard Sherman
              Turrell Herbarium will    purchase new herbarium  cases and 2) employ graduate
              teaching fellow equivalents to process and  curate (including barcoding)
              approximately 105,000 specimens  acquired  as gifts, bequests, orphan
              collections and backlog during 1994. The  project will upgrade the herbmum
              faclity by the acquisition of seventy  herbmum cases, forty five of which
              represent replacements for cases  that have exceeded their useful life and are
              in such poor condition as  to jeopardize the collections housed in those cases.
              Twenty-five new  cases will complete the current herbarium facility and to
              allow for the  processing and intercalation of approximately 105,000 specimens.
               Acquiring new herbarium cases will also allow for the total  reorganization of
              the Herbarium so that it is a more user friendly  facility for both teaching
              and research by faculty and students at  Miami University as well as a
              significant visitor and borrower  population. It is anticipated that the
              completion of intercalation and  reorganization of the collection will better
              serve the environmental  and conservation community that depends of the
              collection and  associated data in the development of various management
              strategies  both within    and outside the state of Ohio.               Once
              the specimens have been processed and intercalmed into the  Herbarium it will
              be ranked as the largest herbarium facility in the  state of Ohio. The
              collection will be especially valuable because it  will represent one of the
              major non-vascular plant holdings in any  university in the mid-western United
              States with approximately 180,000  algal, bryological and mycological specimens
              and approximately another  260,000 vascular plant specimens. The herbarium's
              mycological  collection will be among the ten largest in a university setting
              in the  United States. This project is a necessary prelude to computerization 
              of the collection in the near future.
