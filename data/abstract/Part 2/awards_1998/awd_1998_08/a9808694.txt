Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the nature of constraint  systems that can be used
              to solve problems in the compile-  time analysis of programs that manipulate
              arrays.  Accurate  analysis of array references is critical to the automatic 
              optimization of scientific programs for parallel  supercomputers.  Empirical
              evidence has shown that this  analysis can be described accurately using
              constraints  (which is not surprising), and that the resulting  constraints can
              be manipulated efficiently (which is quite  surprising, given the constraint
              system involved).  This  project will investigate the apparent discrepancy
              between  the worst-case complexity of the general constraint solver  (2^2^2^n)
              and the observed efficiency of constraint-based  dependence analysis, seeking a
              formal description of a  constraint system that includes many of the cases that
              arise  during analysis of benchmark programs but can still be  manipulated
              efficiently.  Such a formal description will  provide a deeper understanding of
              the practical applications  of constraint manipulation algorithms and provide a
              guide  for potential users.  The new constraint manipulation  algorithms will
              be implemented within the framework of the  National Compiler Infrastructure
              and made freely available.
