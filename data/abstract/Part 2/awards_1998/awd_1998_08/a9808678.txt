Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry   at Arizona
              State University to purchase a  nuclear magnetic resonance   (NMR) spectrometer
              console.  The console will provide the department with   an upgraded 500 MHz
              NMR spectrometer.This equipment will enhance research   in a number of areas
              such as the following: (1) the study of fundamental   processes involved in
              damage and repair of DNA by  proteins, (2) the   development of optical probes
              capable of monitoring conformational   changes in single protein and
              protein/DNA molecules, (3) structural and   mechanistic studies of proteins
              from snake venoms that have long-lasting   toxic action on muscle cells, (4)
              mechanistic studies of chemicals that   can lead to selective fragmentation of
              DNA,  and (5)structure   determination of glycoproteins that are involved in
              immune response.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
