Abstract    :
              9808656  LALLIER   The formation of  the vertebrate central  nervous system is
              characterized by two major cellular processes:  1) the instruction of the
              ectoderm to differentiate into nerve  cells (neural induction), and 2) the
              movement of this ectoderm  from the surface of the embryo into the interior
              (neurulation).  While much is understood about the cellular mechanism
              underlying  the first, little is known about the second.  Dr. Lallier will 
              investigate how the cells of the future brain and spinal cord move  inside of
              the embryo using the frog Xenopus laevis as his model  system.  Dr. Lallier has
              previously demonstrated that a cell-  surface molecule called alpha-6 integrin
              is necessary for  neurulation.  Alpha-6 integrin helps anchor presumptive
              neural  ectoderm to its extracellular environment; specifically, to the  axon
              stimulating molecule laminin.  The present studies are aimed  at discovering
              whether this molecule is required for neural  induction or neurulation. 
              Preliminary data suggest that the alpha-  6 integrin is not required for the
              induction of a series of genes  expressed specifically during the early phases
              of neural  induction.  Therefore an in depth study of the role of  alpha-6 
              integrin in the cellular and mechanical events of neurulation are  planned. 
              These results will enable researchers to better  understand this essential
              early developmental event in the  formation of the nervous system.
