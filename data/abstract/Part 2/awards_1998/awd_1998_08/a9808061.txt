Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist
              faculty in the Department of Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute   of
              Technology to acquire an upgrade of an existing 500 MHz nuclear   magnetic
              resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance   research in a
              number of areas, including studies on transition   metal-ligand interactions,
              studies on bonding in a terminal carbide   anion, development of chiral
              catalysts for stereoselective synthesis, and   studies of oligosaccharide
              structures.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
                It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these studies have potential technological   impact in areas
              such as catalysis and molecular sensors.
