Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at The University   of
              California in Davis to  acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector.  
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the  
              following: (1) studies of the geometry and reactive sites in fullerene  
              chemistry; (2) identification of species produced during metalloporphyrin  
              oxidative degradation; (3) structural parameters of luminescent   heavy-metal
              complexes; (4) new superconducting materials with interesting   magnetic and
              optical properties; (5) chemistry of model biological   compounds and their
              metal complexes; and (6) recovery and synthesis of   new natural products with
              biological activity.   The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and
              precise   measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule.
              The   information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances  
              and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information   about
              the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring  
              molecules.
