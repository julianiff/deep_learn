Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at The University of Washington to   acquire a DEC
              workstation cluster.  This upgrade will increase   computational speed by more
              than a factor of five and also allow large   core jobs access to a core memory
              capacity enhanced by a factor of eight.    These enhancements will meet the
              computational needs of chemists working   in a variety of research areas
              including (i) surface and materials   chemistry; (ii) theoretical organic
              chemistry; and (iii) free energies of   complex systems and Bose condensation. 
                A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer  
              network` also serves as a development environment for new theoretical   codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization  
              facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of  
              parallel processing.
