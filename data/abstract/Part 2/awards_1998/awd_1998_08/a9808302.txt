Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important enzyme in folate
              metabolism as its reaction product, tetrahydrofolate, is required for DNA
              synthesis and other metabolic pathways. The type II R-plasmid encoded DHFR,
              typified by R67 DHFR, is especially interesting as it is not homologous with
              chromosomal DHFR.
R67 DHFR is a homotetramer with a monomer length of 78 amino
              acids,
making it one of the smallest enzymes known to self-assemble into an
              active quaternary structure.  A high resolution crystal structure identifies
              the central pore as the binding site for both substrate, dihydrofolate, and
              cofactor, NADPH.  The single active site pore possesses exact 222 symmetry
              which minimizes the expenditure of energy and DNA in encoding the genetic
              information.  A disadvantage of this symmetry is the presence of multiple,
              nonproductive binding modes, e.g. R67 DHFR-2 NADPH and R67 DHFR-2
              dihydrofolate, which block formation of the productive complex, R67
              DHFR-NADPH-dihydrofolate.  The consequences of this symmetry on binding and
              catalysis will be explored using NMR and site directed mutagenesis techniques. 
              Breaking the symmetry of the R67 DHFR active site pore and making asymmetric
              mutations may allow enhancement of enzyme activity.  Artificial quadruplication
              of the R67 DHFR gene has produced a single polypeptide possessing the essential
              structure of tetrameric R67 DHFR.  Single mutations in this construct may allow
              independent manipulation of each face of the active site pore, facilitating
              optimal interaction with each individual ligand.

This research focuses on
              the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This particular protein, R67 DHFR,
              is encoded by an extra-chromosomal DNA element that can be readily transferred
              between bacteria.  This study of R67 DHFR addresses the following questions: 
              how does R67 DHFR catalyze its reaction?  how does enzyme activity evolve? and
              ultimately, what is the design of potent inhibitors of this DHFR?
