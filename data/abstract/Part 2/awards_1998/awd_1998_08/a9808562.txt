Abstract    :
              Davidson
Pyrimidines are essential to normal cellular metabolism, proliferation
              and viability and to normal animal development. The research to be conducted is
              focused on the first three steps in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines (i.e.
              the enzymes carbamyl phosphate synthetase [CPSase], aspartate transcarbamylase
              [ATCase], and dihydroorotase [DHOase]). In mammals, these three enzymes are
              found in a single translation product of ~240,000 daltons called CAD. Three
              specific aims will be pursued. The first is to learn how the carboxyl end of
              the DHOase domain contributes to enzymatic function when it is so different
              from its counterpart in E. coli. Specific site-directed substitutions made in
              the hamster DHOase will be analyzed for enzymatic kinetics both when the DHOase
              is expressed as a monoenzymatic protein and as a domain in CAD. The second aim
              is to identify those residues in the allosteric domain of the CPSase that bind
              the negative effector, UTP, and the positive effector, PRPP. CAD carrying
              substitutions in the allosteric domain will be assayed in vitro for activity in
              the presence or absence of UTP and PRPP and will be introduced into Drosophila
              in order to see how alterations in allosteric regulation affect fly development
              and pyrimidine levels. The third aim is to examine the pattern of regulated CAD
              expression in mouse embryos and in adult mouse organs. Tissue slices will be
              hybridized with 35S-labeled CAD antisense RNA to reveal those cells expressing
              CAD RNA and by inference the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The 
              results of this research will provide new data on the structure and function of
              an essential multienzymatic protein, on the importance of regulating the first
              step in a biosynthetic pathway and on when and where CAD is expressed in animal
              tissues.
