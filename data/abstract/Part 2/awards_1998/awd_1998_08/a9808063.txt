Abstract    :
              Investigators are performing a series of observational and theoretical programs
              on the structure and dynamics of magnetic fields in filament channels,
              particularly the origin of the axial field.  Using several ground- and
              space-based observational telescopes, they study magnetic features and plasma
              flows in and around filament channels on the Sun.  They are searching for
              evidence of magnetic reconnection in small-scale emerging or canceling bipoles
              near polarity inversion lines.  In addition, they seek to deduce axial fields
              in prominences and filament channels observed near the limb, as well as the
              evolution of filament channels and filaments at high latitude, and the
              formation of the polar crowns.  Finally, they use satellite data to study the
              role of magnetic reconnection in establishing observed global patterns of
              helicity in prominences and coronal arcades.
