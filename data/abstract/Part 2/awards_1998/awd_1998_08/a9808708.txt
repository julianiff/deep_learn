Abstract    :
                  9808708  Fajer  The long term goal of Dr. Fajer's research is to determine
              molecular events which transform chemical energy of ATP into mechanical energy
              of muscle.  Although muscular action is limited to animals, it is likely that a
              similar mechanism underlies action of other biological motors involved in
              cellular motility, cytoplasmic transport, separation of chromosomes, and
              activities necessary for any survival of all biological organisms.  As with any
              motor, biological or not, one can expect moving parts and changes in relative
              disposition of proteins involved.  Therefore, the investigation of protein
              dynamics and their orientation is indispensable in the attempt to understand
              the mechanism of biological motors    In this grant the PI proposes to combine
              the spectroscopic methods capable of measuring both dynamics and orientation of
              labeled proteins with the chemical approaches trapping the biochemical cycle of
              actomyosin in well defined states.  Since the myosin head does not behave as a
              rigid body, the PI plans to develop new labeled sites in the regulatory domain
              of myosin complementing the behavior of the catalytic domain.
