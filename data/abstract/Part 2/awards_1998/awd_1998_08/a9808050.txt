Since the nineteenth century, scholars have written
              voluminously  on homicide the U.S. to try to explain why this country has the
              highest rates of violence among industrialized nations.  Little work has been
              done on homicide and other violent crimes where rates are low.  Northern New
              England, where violent crime rates are among the lowest in the nation, has been
              largely neglected.  Studies of Southern, immigrant, minority, urban violence
              rest on assumptions, usually implicit, about why homicide rates are low among
              Northern, settled, native, rural, white people. The purpose of this  project,
              therefore, is to create a long-term, disaggregated time series of violent
              crimes and violent deaths in New Hampshire and Vermont.  The study includes
              suicides, accidental deaths, and casualties of war, because the history of
              homicide is intricately intertwined with the history of reckless behavior ,
              although the focus is homicide.  Data will be compared to those from selected
              counties in Ohio, Georgia, and Virginia so hypotheses concerning northern New
              England can be tested.  Data analysis methods include exploratory data
              analysis, log-linear analysis, and other appropriate techniques.   Results of
              this work are expected to  have a major impact on sociolegal theorizing about
              the factors that contribute to violence and will provide an historical contrast
              for policy makers who hope to intervene to reduce current levels of
              violence.
