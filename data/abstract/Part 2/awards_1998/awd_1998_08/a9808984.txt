Abstract    :
              Social scientists ordinarily classify the economic life of communities by a
              dominant mode of subsistence, such as foraging, agriculture, pastoralism, petty
              manufacture, etc. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology
              student at the University of North Carolina will study how hunter-gatherers of
              Madagascar meet their needs for subsistence and consumer gods thorough a
              diverse array of economic and ecological decisions.  While all the members of
              the society hunt and gather to some extent, many households also maintain a
              diverse portfolio of maize and tuber cultivation, cattle and goat herding,
              fishing and manufacturing of mats and baskets for sale. Within this suite of
              possibilities a particular household is faced with options, between subsistence
              and cash, activities in different environmental zones, immediate and delayed
              returns, men, women and children's labor, and among diverse markets.  This
              project will study the economic activities and decisions of a set of households
              in order to understand how risk is managed to survive in an unpredictable
              environment with a rudimentary technological tool kit.  Understanding
              strategies within such a diverse economy is vital for understanding the general
              processes of economic and cultural change, whether they occur at the origins of
              agriculture or in the ongoing transition of small, rural populations into the
              global market economy.
