Cupp-Vickery
     Cytochrome P450 monoxygenases are a widely
              distributed class of b-type heme-
proteins that catalyze mixed function
              oxidations of hydrocarbon substrates. In
mammalian physiology, P450
              monoxygenase systems participate in the metabolism of
steroid hormones,
              vitamin D, bile acids, and provide one of the primary means by which
the body
              rids itself of toxic substances.  The studies focus on two
              macrolide	
hydroxylases from Saccharopolyspora erythraea which are involved in
              erythromycin
biosynthesis: the C6-hydroxylase P450eryF and the C-12
              hydroxylase P450eryK. The
specific aims of this project are to:
	1.
              Characterize and crystallize P450eryK for structure determination.	
	2.
              Determine the structure of steroids complexed with cytochrome P450eryF.
	3.
              Determine the mechanism of flavonoid activation of P450s.

    The long range
              goal of this work is to determine the active site three-dimensional structure
              and specific protein-substrate interactions which dictate substrate and
              hydroxylation specificity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The crystal structure of
              P450eryK will contribute to the determination of the active-site
              three-dimensional structure and specific protein-substrate interactions which
              dictate substrate and hydroxylation specificity. In addition, the
              P450eryF/steroid structures will be the first P450/steroid structures and will
              identify the steroid-protein interactions which may be critical for binding and
              hydroxylation specificity. Furthermore, the determination of the
              P450eryF/flavonoid complexes will identify the flavonoid binding site and
              provide insights into the mechanism of flavonoid activation of P450 enzymes.
              The results from these studies should lead to a better general understanding of
              cytochrome P450 function and structure, and they should enable us to develop
              better models of the active sites of mammalian P450 enzymes and their complexes
              with steroids and modulators.
