Abstract    :
                    9808148  Amasino  This conference will provide researchers the opportunity
              to share research findings on the model plant system.  The conference will
              include oral research presentations on gene regulatory mechanisms, new genetic
              approaches, biochemical genetics, biotic stress and environmental responses,
              development, reproductive systems, plant pathogen interactions, signal
              transduction, and cell-cell interactions.  Poster presentations on these and
              other topics will also be included.  The proposal will provide travel support
              for speakers, especially young PIs, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.
