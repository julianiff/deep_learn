Abstract    :
                   The retina is the nerve tissue inside the eye, forming a  complex
              processing stage for visual information.  It is the  crucial first stage where
              light reception starts to turn into  vision.  This conference is the fourth
              biennial one in a series  devoted to the retina.  The five day meeting will
              cover issues of  retinal development, cellular functions that support neural 
              signaling in the retina, neural circuits in the retina that  process visual
              information, coding of information in the optic  nerve from the retina to the
              brain, and some of the resulting  abilities and limitations of visual behavior.
               The conference  format is designed to promote a lot of discussions, not simply
               formal talks, and includes two workshops.     This meeting will have an impact
              on visual neuroscience, and  because of the emphasis on fostering the careers
              of young  investigators, it will also have an important impact on the 
              infrastructure of neuroscience.
