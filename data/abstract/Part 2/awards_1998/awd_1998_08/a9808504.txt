              of community assembly will be expanded by examining northern pitcher plants and
              the organisms that live within them.  This work will develop models of the
              inquiline organisms that inhabit pitchers while conducting field and laboratory
              experiments to elucidate the factors driving community colonization,
              persistence, growth, and dynamics particularly as related to in-plant nutrient
              dynamics.  This work will provide an overview of the linkages between inquiline
              communities and their host pitcher plants.  Considerations of plant performance
              with different inquiline communities will expand upon previous efforts that
              have emphasized the animal component of these associations. Markovian models on
              individual leaves will be combined with matrix models of pitcher-plant growth
              to assess overall plant growth and the roles of N and P limitation in these bog
              habitats.  More generally, the data gathered will enable the development,
              refinement, and testing of a mathematical model of community assembly in
              dynamic habitats.  This model will integrate a broad range of ecological
              features and will eventually be applicable to a diversity of community
              assemblages.
