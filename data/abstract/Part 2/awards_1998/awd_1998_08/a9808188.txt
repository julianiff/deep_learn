Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon   University
              to acquire a MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance
              research which includes (1) polymer characterization; (2) design,   synthesis
              and characterization of solid state organic materials with   novel  electrical,
              magnetic and optical properties; (3) biocatalytic   synthesis of specialty
              polymers; and (4)characterization of peptide   nucleic acid oligomers.  Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details
              and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of
              matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) extends   the range of MS
              to non-volatile molecules, such as proteins and nucleic   acids.  It affords
              the chemist one of the most powerful tools available   for the characterization
              of compounds. The acquisition of this capability   in mass spectrometry is
              essential for conducting frontier research in   many fields of chemistry.
