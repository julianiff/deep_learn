Abstract    :
                   The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) forms  some of the
              largest aggregations of mammals known to mankind, with  single caves in
              south-central Texas housing upwards to 20 million  individuals. Although it is
              commonly assumed that these aerial  predators feed on insect populations in
              both natural and managed  ecosystems, relatively little is known about their
              population  densities and nightly foraging behavior.              In this
              three-year study, the density, composition, diet, and  foraging behavior of
              Brazilian free-tailed bat populations in south-  central Texas are being
              measured and modeled for use with  previously published data on food habits,
              pesticide use, and crop  production to evaluate the impact of these bats on
              agricultural  production. Population densities and spatial patterns of foraging
               bats are being assessed using advanced infrared and Doppler radar  imaging to
              provide the basic data for GIS analysis.  Remote sensing  methods and the
              resulting integrated economic model have important  applications for assessing
              demographic and behavioral  characteristics of other animal species and their
              economic impact  on selected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
