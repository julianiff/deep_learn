Abstract    :
                  9808823  Cheng  The overall research goal of this laboratory is to elucidate
              the regulatory pathways through which nitrate and light signals act
              coordinately to regulate nitrate reductase (NR) gene expression.  This research
              program is important to the advancement of science because these regulatory
              pathways are fundamental to plant growth and development.  Nitrate assimilation
              and photosynthesis are the two most energy-consuming pathways in plant.  One
              way to achieve balance of these two pathways is to place expression of the NR
              genes under the control of a plant's photosynthesis capacity. 
              Photomorphogenesis during seed germination marks the onset of photosynthesis. 
              Among the regulatory mutants we have isolated that affect NR gene expression,
              one mutant, cr88, is also defective in photomorphogenesis.  This discovery
              genetically links expression of the NR genes with the photomorphogenic
              signaling cascade.  The research proposed here will 1) determine the
              growth-stage specific requirement of CR88, 2) position CR88 in the
              photomorphogenic pathway, 3) isolate additional cr88 mutant alleles and clone
              the CR88 gene, and 4) elucidate the biochemical and physiological function(s)
              of CR88.  Studies of CR88 will provide insights into the mechanisms by which
              expression of some of the genes involved in nitrate assimilation and
              photomorphogenesis is regulated coordinately.  This understanding may allow
              genetic manipulation of crop plants that respond to nitrate and photosynthetic
              activity optimally for agricultural practices.
