Abstract    :
                  9808309  Nothnagel  This is the 20th Annual Symposium in Plant Physiology
              entitled "Cell and Developmental Biology of Arabinogalactan-Proteins," to be
              held on January 21-23, 1999 at the University of California, Riverside.  This
              conference will provide researchers the opportunity to share research findings
              on Arabinogalactan molecules that are a class of complex macromolecules found
              on plant cell surfaces.  Recent research indicates that these molecules serve
              important roles in plant growth and development.  This meeting will bring
              together researchers in the field and to provide researchers the opportunity to
              establish future collaborative research projects.  The meeting will involve a
              combination of oral and poster presentations.  This meeting is unique in that
              it is the first meeting that will be focused specifically on plant
              arabinogalactan molecules.
