This
              research will address the question: Why and how do individuals with the same
              genetic constitution sometimes produce strikingly different forms? The problem
              will be investigated by using spadefoot toad tadpoles as a model system.
              Spadefoot toad tadpoles are unusual in that any given individual can develop
              into two different forms. Following ingestion of fairy shrimp or other
              tadpoles, typical omnivorous tadpoles may alter their behavior and development
              to assume a distinctive carnivorous form, which then metamorphoses into an
              adult toad more quickly. The specific goals of the research would be to: (1)
              determine what developmental and physiological processes cause these two forms
              to be produced, (2) determine if there is a genetic basis to the variation, and
              (3) identify the environmental factors that maintain the two forms within the
              same population.
Spadefoot tadpoles are excellent model animals for studying
              and teaching others about developmental biology and ecology. The planned
              research is important in that it will address how the environment interacts
              with an organism's genes during development to produce alternative forms. Such
              research will provide critical insight into developmental processes and the
              role of development in enabling organisms to adapt to changing
              environments.
