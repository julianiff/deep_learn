Abstract    :
              9808944  Driscoll  This LTREB research will continue to support long-term
              ecological and biogeochemical studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest
              in New Hampshire to evaluate patterns and trends in the chemistry of
              atmospheric deposition, stream water and lake water, and to support efforts at
              synthesis and ecological integration of this information. Biogeochemical data
              that have been collected over the past 34 years and that will continue to be
              collected will be used to test critical hypotheses on (i) atmospheric
              deposition of strong acids and surface water acidification, (ii) the role of
              atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, nitrogen uptake by vegetation, and climatic
              factors on ecosystem nitrogen loss, and (iii) the effects of changing land-use
              on water quality. We will use long-term measurements of biogeochemistry and
              hydrology, the small watershed-ecosystem approach, and simulation models to
              test these hypotheses. An important aspect of the long-tern studies at Hubbard
              Brook is to separate the effects of local human-caused, land-use changes and
              natural forest succession from the impacts of regional disturbances, such as
              acid rain and climate changes.
