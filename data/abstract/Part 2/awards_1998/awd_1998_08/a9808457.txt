Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Purdue University to acquire a 400   MHz solid state
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This will   enhance faculty
              research in a number of areas, including studies on 1)   photocatalysis and
              photoluminescent solid-state materials; 2) complex   encapsulated microporous
              and mesoporous systems and heterogeneous   catalysts; 3) structure and
              stability of organic solids including   pharmaceutical solids; 4)
              nanostructured electronic materials; 5)   structure and dynamical studies of
              polycarbonate materials; and 6)   structure and synthesis of supramolecular
              systems based on carbohydrates.      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in materials science.
