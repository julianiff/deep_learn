Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Florida State University to acquire   a
              time-resolved spectrometer based on a titanium:sapphire laser.  This   system
              will provide new capabilities for greater time resolution, a wide   range of
              sample excitation wavelengths, and the recording of transient   absorption
              spectra into the ultraviolet.  Research will focus on   condensed phase
              studies, including a) probing photoinduced phenomena in   organic molecules in
              solution; b) excitation dynamics in complex   molecular systems; c) probing
              photochemical reaction mechanisms in the   femtosecond time domain; and d)
              photophysical and photochemical processes   in metal/silica solids.    The
              laser system is an extremely versatile spectrometer that can be used   to
              accomplish numerous photophysical and photochemical studies.  The   faculty
              will be able to probe extremely fundamental processes, and these   studies will
              yield information not previously attainable.
