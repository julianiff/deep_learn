This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Research award is for a
              project on "Ulam's Problem and Related Questions in Algebraic and Geometric
              Topology" between Dr. Slawomir Kwasik of Tulane University and Professor Witold
              Rosicki of the University of Gdansk.  The researchers propose to study various
              questions which revolve around Ulam's Problem, homotopical equality of h-equal
              CW complexes and the problem concerning manifold spines.  They will also study
              a problem of a more computational nature related to algebraic K-theory.  They
              will use methods of low-dimensional and high-dimensional topology together with
              techniques of surgery theory and gauge theory.  They also will employ
              computational techniques related to algebraic number theory.

This research
              in mathematics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
