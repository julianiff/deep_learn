Abstract    :
              9808948  Terleckyj  The objective of the project is to develop a prototype of a 
              system of quantitative indicators which will identify, for a  specified time
              period, components of growth of employment  and earnings of states and of
              smaller economic areas.  The  indicators will detail changes in employment
              (earnings) of  firms in technology intensive and in other industries, and  will
              further detail these changes by size classes of firms  at the beginning of the
              period, also identifying new firms  established during the period.  The
              proposed data system  prototype will be developed with data from the
              cooperative  federal-state ES-202 employment data program for one state, 
              Virginia, and for its regional economies.  The project will  also explore the
              potential for replicating such indicator  systems in other states.  This
              proposed project is intended  to show how existing company data in the ES-202
              databases  can be organized into quantitative regional indicators that  would
              allow researchers and policymakers to address at least  some of the important
              questions about the actual role in the  processes of regional growth of new,
              small, and large firms  in technology-intensive and other industries.  ***
