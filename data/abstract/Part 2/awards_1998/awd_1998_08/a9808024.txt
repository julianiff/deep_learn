Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF)  will assist the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State   University
              in purchasing two powder X-ray diffraction systems that will   complement each
              other as bulk powder analysis and thin film analysis   instruments.   The x-ray
              equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas including the following:
              (1) rare earth Zintl materials,  high   pressure structural studies and thin
              film studies, (2) silicon based   materials and polymerization, (3) conducting
              polymer nanostructures and   nanostructures as secondary batteries, (4) Van der
              Waals epitaxy,   electrochemical oxidation of superconductor thin films and
              epitaxial   growth of chalcopyrite semiconductors, and (5) nonclassical metal  
              carbonyls.    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise  
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The  
              information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances   and
              bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information   about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
