Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University to acquire   instrumentation
              for nanosecond time-resolved infrared measurements.  The   instrumentation will
              be used to study a variety of chemical systems,   including (a) important
              intermediates in the photophysics and   photochemistry of organometallic
              compounds, nitrenes, and psoralens; (b)   charge carrier relaxation in
              electroluminescent conducting polymers; (c)   the structure and dynamics of
              electron transfer processes in artificial   photosynthetic systems; and (d) the
              photocleavage of DNA by charge   transfer states.    The laser system is an
              extremely versatile spectrometer that can be used   to accomplish numerous
              photophysical and photochemical studies.  The   faculty will be able to probe
              fundamental processes at a level of detail   not previously attainable.
