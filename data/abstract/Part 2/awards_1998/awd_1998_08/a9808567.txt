Abstract    :
              IBN 98-08657  SCHMAUSS      This study uses genetically modified mice with cells
              that lack  two proteins known to be involved in the processing of 
              neurochemical information in the brain. This information is  mediated by an
              important neurotransmitter chemical, dopamine,  which is released as a signal
              by other nerve cells and normally  interacts directly with these two receptor
              proteins. By studying  the consequences of a "loss of functions" in these mice,
              the  experiments will define the precise functions of these two  receptor
              proteins. It is known, that both proteins modulate  (alter) motor, cognitive,
              and motivational behavior. However, how  they modulate this behavior is still
              unknown. The study therefore  aims to find which particular form of these
              receptor molecules is  targeted to which particular area of nerve cells to be
              made  accessible to dopamine and thus, to mediate specific functions. 
              Furthermore, the expression (occurrence in cells) of other  molecules of the
              brain whose function is tightly associated with  the activity of the two
              receptor proteins that are missing in the  genetically modified mice will be
              studied to determine whether  these molecules are also essential for mediating
              the effects of  dopamine. Finally, another series of experiments studies the
              role  of the two receptor proteins for the normal development of the  brain.
              Altogether, the goal of the study is to obtain novel and  important information
              about some of the fundamental biological  mechanisms by which the brain
              processes information that is  mediated by one of its major neurotransmitters.
