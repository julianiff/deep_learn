Abstract    :
              KUPFER, J.A., CAIRNS, D.M., and ALLEN, T.R.  The study examines pattern and
              process of the deciduous-coniferous ecotone (DCE) in Great Smoky Mountains
              National Park.  It is predicated on the assertion that changes in ecotone
              location or form can be used to detect the effects of climate change on plant
              communities because, at ecotones, many species are essentially at the limits of
              their ranges.  Thus, small changes in climate should lead to a comparatively
              quick and readily noticeable change in vegetation structure or composition. 
              The research strategy has three components:  (1) analysis of remotely-sensed
              data on vegetation type and condition; (2) field-based observations of forest
              composition; and (3) modeling of carbon cycles below, at, and above the DCE. 
              Results of this research will provide insight into the nature and dynamics of
              ecotones as well as being important to understanding potential changes in
              ecosystems brought about by climate-change scenarios.
