Abstract    :
                Cunningham  9808267    This project investigates the impact of the powerful
              1997 El Nino Southern Oscillation Event on coastal marine organisms. During
              E.N.S.O. years, the ocean current that normally brings cold water south along
              the Western United States changes direction.  This change in direction not only
              reverses the direction of flow, but raises sea surface temperatures far beyond
              normal.  During E.N.S.O. years, many marine organisms are found far to the
              north of their normal geographic ranges.  In this project, we are asking
              whether E.N.S.O. events have an effect on the genetic population structure of
              the common acorn barnacle Balanus glandula.  Previous work has shown that
              barnacles collected to the south of Monterey Bay have a characteristic genetic
              signature.  We will be asking if the proportion of southern individuals north
              of Monterey increases as a result of the northward flowing current.      This
              project is important because the warmer conditions of E.N.S.O. years provide a
              window onto the consequences of global warming on the geographic ranges of
              marine species.  These studies can help identify which species will benefit,
              and which ones will be hurt by global warming.  This study takes the unique
              perspective of studying the effects of warming trends on the genetics within
              species.  This is especially useful, because genetics can provide information
              about past distribution and dispersal patterns.
