Abstract    :
                Blue monkeys live in groups with a single adult male for most of the year,
              although other males may join the group during the mating season, even 'moving
              in' for several months.  By measuring paternity in two blue monkey groups in a
              Kenyan rain forest, this project will assess whether long-term resident males
              and temporary intruders are equally successful at siring offspring in the
              group.  We will thus test an assumption which underlies theories that explain
              different social systems, namely that males live in groups to maximize access
              to females and thus to increase their reproductive success.  Reproductive
              behavior of males and females will be monitored in detail during the breeding
              season by teams of observers.  We will relate patterns of male-male competition
              (chases and fights) and female mate preferences to offspring paternity.  We can
              then assess whether male dominance correlates with increased reproductive
              output, and whether female mate preferences influence paternity.  Our results
              will not only provide information on one species with an unexpectedly dynamic
              social system, but also comparative data from a little-studied primate
              radiation that can be used in testing and developing theories applicable to
              other primates and animals.
