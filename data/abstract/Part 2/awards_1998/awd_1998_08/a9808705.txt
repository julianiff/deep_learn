Abstract    :
              Scott Matthew, P.  IBN-9808705    Funds are requested for partial support of the
              57th Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology, to be held at
              Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, June 20-25, 1998.  Dr. Scott is
              requesting partial support of the expenses for the invited plenary and symposia
              speakers, as well as partial support of the travel expenses for undergraduate,
              graduate and early postdoctoral students who will be presenting their work at
              poster sessions. The meeting will have about 800 registrants and will provide
              opportunities to hear the latest work from international leaders in the field,
              as well as from younger scientists whose work will be chosen from the abstracts
              for oral presentation. There will be two large poster sessions, each for two
              days, allowing everyone a chance to present their work to a richly diverse
              audience. The topics of the plenary sessions have been chosen to represent some
              of the most exciting areas of current developmental biology research, including
              early development, signaling systems, neural development and patterning, and
              cell guidance systems. Symposia topics are far ranging: organogenesis, signal
              transduction, coordination and maintenance of gene regulation, cell biology of
              development, axial patterning, development and evolution, eye development,
              medicine and development, morphogenesis, and homeobox gene function and
              evolution. Work with plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi will be included, and
              multidisciplinary approaches will be emphasized, including connections with
              human biology. Continuing the success of issue-oriented workshops at recent SDB
              annual meetings, we will hold workshops on education, ethics, and applications
              of computers and imaging technology, funding and future directions in science.
