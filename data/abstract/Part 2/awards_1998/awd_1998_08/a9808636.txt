Abstract    :
              Porter
The expression of mammalian cytochromes P450 in Escherichia coli has
              become an important means to evaluate the metabolic roles and specificities of
              these ubiquitous hemeprotein monooxygenases. More recently, catalytically
              active P450 systems have been established in bacterial cells in vivo by
              coexpressing NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, the obligate electron transfer
              partner for the endoplasmic reticular P450's. This advance has opened the door
              to a number of biotechnological opportunities, including the use of these
              recombinant bacteria in complex chemical syntheses, in bioremediation, and, in
              combination with directed and undirected mutagenesis, the selection of
              microorganisms and enzymes with novel catalytic properties. The utility of P450
              expression in bacteria remains largely unexplored and is subject to some
              technical limitations. First, intracellular NADPH levels may limit catalytic
              activity in the absence of high 02 and carbon substrate levels. Second, some
              P450's, including cytochrome P450 2E1, require cytochrome b5 for maximal
              activity. And third, many P450's are poorly expressed in bacteria, limiting
              catalytic activity in both in vivo and in vitro preparations. This research
              will address these limitations by (i) converting NADPH-cytochrome P450
              reductase to an NADH-specific enzyme; (ii) enhancing the activity of cytochrome
              P450 2E1 by coexpressing cytochrome b5 and its NADH-dependent electron transfer
              pathway; and (iii) increasing the expression of cytochrome P450 2EI by
              identifying and modifying factors that impede translation or promote
              degradation. These studies are designed to further our knowledge of the factors
              that influence P450 expression and activity in E coli, and to facilitate the
              development and implementation of biotechnological uses for this versatile
              enzyme.

Cytochrome P450 is a versatile enzyme that carries out many chemical
              reactions that are difficult to achieve synthetically. The many different forms
              of this enzyme are of interest to the biotechnological research community, but
              it has proven difficult to obtain sufficient levels of these enzymes in pure
              form for commercial applications. This research will explore the factors that
              limit the expression and activity of these enzymes in bacteria. Structural
              modifications will be made to the enzymes to increase their activity and 
              stabilize their expression in bacteria. Additional enzymes that enhance the
              activity of cytochrome P450 will be coexpressed, with the goal of obtaining
              recombinant laboratory organisms that can be used for the commercial production
              of these enzymes, as well as facilitate their use in various biotechnological
              applications, including fine chemical syntheses, testing of chemicals for
              mutagenic/carcinogenic potential, and, perhaps eventually, bioremediation.
