Abstract    :
              In an observational study or nonrandomized experiment, treated and control
              groups formed without random assignment are compared in an effort to estimate
              the effects of a treatment.  Observational studies are common in most fields
              that study the effects of policies, programs, or hazards on people.  In an
              observational study, treated and control groups may have differed prior to
              treatment in ways that are relevant for the outcomes under study, and these
              pretreatment differences may be mistaken for an effect of the treatment.  If
              the groups differed in terms of relevant pretreatment variables or covariates
              that were observed and recorded, then there is an overt bias.  If the groups
              differed in terms of covariates that were not recorded, then there is a hidden
              bias.  Controlling overt biases and addressing hidden biases are central
              concerns in an observational study.  The proposed work concerns improvements in
              both research design and analysis to reduce and address the biases that arise
              in observational studies.  The work is of methodological relevance to the
              diverse fields that study the effects of interventions on human populations,
              including epidemiology, psychology, economics, and educational research.
