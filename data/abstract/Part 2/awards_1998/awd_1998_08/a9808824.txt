Abstract    :
                The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium, a National  Systematics Research
              Resource Center, is the country's  largest repository of plant and fungal
              specimens. It is  a vast, actively managed, and intensively used  collection of
              6,000,000 specimens  representing all  plant and fungal groups and is worldwide
              in scope.  Because of the size and richness of the collection, the  NYBG
              Herbarium serves as a primary source of research  materials for botanical
              studies throughout the world.  Virtually all major taxonomic revisions of
              plants of  the Americas and parts of the Old World include  examination of
              specimens deposited in the NYBG  Herbarium.    The NYBG Herbarium regularly
              sends more specimens on  loan than any other herbarium in the world.  An
              average  of 46,529 specimens (643 loans) were sent out in each  of the last
              five years.  Of these 27.5% were sent for  study by students and 72.5% for
              study by professional  researchers; 68.4% were specimens of vascular plants 
              and 31.6% were of non-vascular plants. During the same  period, 1124 visiting
              researchers from 62 foreign  countries and 42 states of the U.S.A spent 10,529
              days  using the collection.  In addition to providing loans  and on-site
              services, NYBG provides data about its  specimens via the internet.  The NYBG
              Herbarium  collections, of all groups of plants and fungi, are an  essential
              resource to professional and student  researchers throughout the world.    This
              project will include assistance for 1) sending  specimens on loan to
              researchers at other institutions  and refiling them upon their return, 2)
              facilitating  studies of specimens at NYBG by visiting researchers,  3)
              fulfilling reasonable requests from academic users  for data or samples from
              specimens housed at NYBG,and  4) requesting and receiving loans of specimens
              from  other herbaria for study by researchers visiting NYBG.
