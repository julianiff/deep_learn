Abstract    :
                9808857  Johnson  Mononuclear molybdenum or tungsten centers coordinated by
              the dithiolene units of one or two special pterin derivatives termed
              molybdopterin, terminal oxo/sulfido groups and/or protein side chains (serine,
              cysteine or selenocysteine) constitute the active sites of more than 30
              distinct classes of oxotransferase enzymes involving formal oxygen atom
              transfer to or from water.  The ubiquitous molybdoenzymes are involved in the
              metabolism of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur catalyzing a diverse range reactions
              spanning more than 800 mV in redox potential, whereas the tungstoenzymes are
              largely confined to thermophilic anaerobes in which they catalyze low potential
              conversions at the level of carboxylic acids and aldehydes.  The objective of
              this research is to explore the structural and mechanistic diversity in this
              class of enzymes with particular emphasis on the role of the molybdopterin and
              terminal oxo ligands and the factors dictating the choice of tungsten or
              molybdenum.  The approach is spectroscopic and exploits recent successes in
              using resonance Raman to probe the active site structures and catalytic
              mechanism via oxygen and sulfur isotopic labeling experiments and the
              combination of variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism and EPR to
              investigate ground and excited state electronic structure.  Detailed
              understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of metallo-enzymes at the molecular
              level will ultimately lead to improved enzymes and catalysts for important
              biological and industrial applications.  In addition to the biotechnological
              implications, this class of enzymes offer a unique opportunity to explore how a
              novel type of metalloenzyme active site has evolved via changes in the metal
              and ligand environment in response to evolutionary terrestrial changes and the
              need to catalyze a wider range of oxotransferase reactions.
