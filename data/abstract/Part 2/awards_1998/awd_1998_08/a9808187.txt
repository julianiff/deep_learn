Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry  at Louisiana   State
              University  to acquire a matrix-assisted laser desorption   ionization
              time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. This equipment   will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following:  (1)   the synthesis of
              base- and sugar-modified oligonucleotides, peptides    incorporating
              non-natural amino acids, phosphonate peptide analogs and   nucleic acids, (2)
              the development of new sequencing methodologies for   phosphorothiolate
              oligonucleotides, (3) the analysis of conducting   oligomers and polymers, (4)
              the synthesis and characterization of   three-dimensional electronic organic
              structures, and (5) studies in the   the area of organized media.  Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used   to probe intimate structural details
              and to obtain the molecular   compositions of a vast array of organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic   molecules.  It affords the chemist one of the
              most powerful tools   available for the characterization of compounds. The
              acquisition of   enhanced capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the
              prosecution   of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
