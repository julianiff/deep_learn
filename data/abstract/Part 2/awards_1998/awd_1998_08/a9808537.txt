Abstract    :
                  9808537  Druffel                              ABSTRACT                      
                         As part of a rapid response effort to study the consequences  of 
              the 1997-1998 El Nino on carbon fluxes in the waters off  of  California, the
              Principal Investigators, Drs. E. Druffel  and J. Bauer, will measure carbon
              isotopes in samples to  be  collected in collaboration with Dr. Ken Smith.  A
              record  of  deep  ocean sediment fluxes has been initiated by Dr.  Smith  using
              moored time-series sediment traps at a site previously  occupied  by  this
              group for a period of  7  years.   It  is  hypothesized  that  the  current El
              Nino  will  dramatically  alter carbon fluxes, and hence have a significant
              impact  on  the  cycling of organic carbon (OC) in the water column  and  the
              delivery of OC to the seafloor and hence the response of  the  benthic
              community. The 1997-1998 El Nino is  considered  to  be a major event within
              this century and the opportunity  should  not  be missed to collect and analyze
               these  unique  samples.   Such  data  would provide new  insights  into  OC 
              cycling, provide important constraints on the effects of  El  Nino  on  the 
              benthic  communities,  and  would  allow  for  improved  understanding  and 
              planning  of  future  El  Nino  studies.   Due  to the rapid response required 
              to  initiate  this  study  during  the ongoing El Nino  season,  the  SGER 
              process  is  being  used to continue the time-series  record  though  1998  and
               to conduct studies of sediment  community  response (Ken Smith, lead PI
              OCE-9807103).  Drs. Druffel and  Bauer  will  use  14C and 13C isotopes and 
              measurements  of  particulate, dissolved and sinking OC to evaluate the effect 
              of  the El Nino on OC distributions and turnover under these  anomalous
              conditions.
