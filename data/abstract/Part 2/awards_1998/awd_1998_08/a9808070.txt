Abstract    :
              The research examines how present landscape patterns are influenced by
              contemporary processes as well as being preconditioned by antecedent variables.
               Contemporary theory in disturbance ecology and vegetation dynamics is
              increasingly sensitive to historical context and attentive to spatial
              heterogeneity.  The study takes advantage of one of the largest forest
              blowdowns in the southern Rocky Mountains, which occurred in late 1997 and
              affected almost 8000 hectares.  Pre-blowdown disturbance history will be
              determined from tree-ring data and mapped on the basis of pre-blowdown aerial
              photographs.  Comparisons to post-blowdown conditions will be made.  Nearby
              sites will act as `controls` to examine the full set of potential disturbance
              interactions such as those arising from fire, bark beetle outbreaks, or logging
              operations.  Results will provide insight into vegetation dynamics and will
              have critical implications for management of forest resources under future
              environmental change scenarios.
