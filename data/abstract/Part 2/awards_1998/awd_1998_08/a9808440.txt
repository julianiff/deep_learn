Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at Arizona State   University
              to acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer with CCD   detector. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   including the following:
              (1) synthetic high hardness materials and   ferroelectrics; (2) multi-component
              molecular optoelectronic devices; (3)   designed microporous materials with
              tailored specific chemical behaviors;   (4) new III-V semiconductor materials;
              (5) previously untenable in situ   pressure/structure/function/studies; and (6)
              recovery and synthesis of   new natural products with biological activity.  
              The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of
              the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained
              gives the precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of
              the molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
