Abstract    :
              Stomotal function will be investigated from the perspective of environmental
              control of epidermal-guard cell water relations.   Biophysical models
              predicting stomatal aperture from turgor and mechanical relationships of guard
              and epidermal cells will be developed.  Additional modeling would be used to
              incorporate the work into leaf-level models that incorporate spatially explicit
              influences on stomata to predict stomatal conductance and photosynthetic
              capacity.
