Abstract    :
              The eighteen databases of the Oregon Coalition for  Interdisciplinary Databases
              (OCID) and the over 250 databases  of the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER)
              at the H.J.  Andrews Experimental Forest will serve as a testbed for a  project
              to develop Web-based software that will make it  possible to integrate
              distributed databases into a seamless  virtual database. The proposed software
              framework will include  Web-based tools for defining metadata to describe what
              aspects  of each database are appropriate for cross-referencing against  other
              databases, as well as software agents that mediate among  independent
              repos-itories of data. The project will  demonstrate how the software can be
              deployed to cross  disciplinary agency and hardware/software boundaries to
              create  a virtual database of bio-logical, geophysical, and climatic  data.
              Such a resource will offer a much richer context for  studying the biology and
              ecology of the northwestern region of  the United States than has been
              available previously. As a  model for interlinking other similar regional and
              national  databases, it will be a valuable resource not only for  research and
              natural resource management, but also for  education. The project brings
              together a multidisciplinary  team led by a computer scientist specializing in
              helping  multidisciplinary groups adapt advanced computing technology  to their
              specific needs and an ecologist-statistician-infor-  mation manager from the
              LTER program. Each of the scientists  who have agreed to coop-erate with the
              PIs has already built  at least one research database of national significance.
              The  close collaboration of computer scientists and biological  scientists on
              this project will yield a practical, well-tested  foundation that database
              owners throughout the country can  exploit to link their own resources with
              colleagues at distant  institutions or in other disci-plines.    ***
