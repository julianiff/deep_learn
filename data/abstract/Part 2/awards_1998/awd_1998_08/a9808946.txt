Abstract    :
              Tiling is a well-known optimization technique that has been used  to obtain
              orders of magnitude performance improvements on certain  types of computer
              programs -- ones with nicely structured loops  and regular memory accesses. 
              This research will extend tiling and  related optimization techniques to a
              larger class of programs.  The methods employed to carry out these goals are:
              (1) Collect a  corpus of scientific applications, including unstructured
              programs  and programs with irregular memory accesses. (2) Build a high-  level
              analysis tool to study this corpus and to provide  information that can be used
              to guide program transformations. (3)  Develop more powerful transformations to
              extend tiling to this  corpus. These transformations will be embodied in a
              source-to-  source program restructurer. (4) Build an architecturally-driven 
              guidance system to guide the choice of transformations. This  system will model
              the multitiered parallelism and memory  hierarchies of modern computers. (5)
              Evaluate the new  transformations compared to hand-optimized versions of the 
              applications. The projected impact of the work is the development  of compiler
              technology that will automatically improve the  performance of a broad class of
              computer programs for scientific  applications.
