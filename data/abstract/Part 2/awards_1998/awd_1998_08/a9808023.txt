Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              School of Chemistry at Clark University to acquire a 400 MHz   solid state
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This will   enhance faculty
              research in a number of areas including studies on 1) the   state of gases in
              synthetic membrane and nanoporous materials by   xenon-129 NMR; 2)
              translational diffusion in polymeric systems; 3)   structure and dynamics in
              polymers using magic angle sample spinning   experiments; and 4) one and
              two-dimensional solid state line shape   studies of reorientational dynamics.  
               Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool  
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It
              is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results
              from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis,
              and in biology.
