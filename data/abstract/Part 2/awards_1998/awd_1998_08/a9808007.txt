Abstract    :
                   This project extends and applies the hidden Markov  model methods, which
              were developed under previous NSF  support, to the problems of finding remote
              homologies  between proteins, producing multiple alignments of related  protein
              domains, and classifying protein domains into  families and subfamilies based
              on common structure, function  and phylogenetic relationship.  New methods of
              combining  mRNA expression data along with sequence similarity to do 
              functional analysis and discover pathways of interactions  between proteins are
              also being developed.  More  sophisticated models of protein structure will
              provide  better recognition of active sites and better detection of  remote
              homologies.  In developing more powerful and  comprehensive computational
              methods for protein  classification and analysis, and making them available on 
              the world wide web, this work will contribute to the basic  study of a wide
              variety of fundamental protein families and  may also lead to the discovery of
              important new protein  families.
