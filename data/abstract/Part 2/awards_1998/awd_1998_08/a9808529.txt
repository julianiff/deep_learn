Abstract    :
                        Thaddeus  9808529    This project is aimed at a number of problems,
              mostly in algebraic geometry but also in symplectic topology, which are
              expected to have consequences for gauge theory, and specifically for
              Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory.  First, it is proposed to study the quantum
              cohomology of symmetric products of Riemann surfaces.  This problem has great
              interest in its own right and is tractable using algebro-geometric methods. 
              Second, considering the Floer theory for a mapping torus of a finite-order map
              leads to a conjecture, of independent interest, about the symplectic topology
              of a symplectomorphism of finite order.  A longer-range goal is a proper
              understanding of the quantum category associated to Seiberg-Witten theory. 
              Several other topics at the interface of algebraic geometry and gauge theory,
              ranging from loop groups to secant varieties, will also be investigated.     
              This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
              figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
              from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
              fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
