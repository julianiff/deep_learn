Abstract    :
              9808902  Honig    This project represents the continuation of a research program
              whose overall objective is to further understanding of the physical principles
              that determine the structure and function of membrane proteins.  Theoretical
              calculations based primarily on numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann
              equation will be used to study important biological processes such as the
              association of proteins with membrane surfaces, lateral  domain formation in
              lipid bilayers and protein-protein interactions in src family kinases. 
              Electrostatic free energies obtained from the calculations will be used
              construct testable models which can explain that remarkable localization
              phenomena that lead to the formation of distinct phases in biological membranes
              and to the precise recognition of specific protein domains for one another. 
              Subcellular localization is a central feature of many biological phenomena such
              as viral assembly and signal transduction. At present there is only limited
              understanding of the processes that underlie these phenomena and their
              physical-chemical basis is even more poorly understood. The proposed
              calculations and the related collaborations with experimental groups are
              intended to fill this existing gap in knowledge by providing detailed
              atom-level explanations of localization and specificity near membrane surfaces.
