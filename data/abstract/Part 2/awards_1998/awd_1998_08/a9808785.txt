Abstract    :
                Harlow  9808785    The black bear may be a paradox. These animals remain
              within their winter  den for 5 to 7 months at or near normal body temperature.
              However, in spite  of prolonged starvation and confinement, overwintering bears
              may not show  apparent characteristics of skeletal muscle atrophy. The PIs
              hypothesize  that bears under natural winter conditions have no loss of muscle
              fiber  number, size, proportion of oxidative fibers or protein content.  The
              PIs  propose to take muscle biopsies from bears and monitor changes in muscle 
              morphology, protein content and protein turnover during early and late  winter
              and midsummer. Bears appear to be capable of rapid and sustained  locomotor
              activity when disturbed at any time during the winter. The PIs  will measure
              strength and activity of the fore and hind- limbs of bears  during the winter
              and summer using noninvasive and nonsubjective  methodologies, The prospect
              that bears can maintain muscle integrity and  strength during a period, with no
              protein intake and tight confinement has  the potential to aid doctors in the
              prescription of treatments that will  help humans adjust to conditions such a s
              prolonged bed rest, limited  activity or extended space travel.
