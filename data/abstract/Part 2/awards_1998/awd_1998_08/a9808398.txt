Abstract    :
                  9808398  Zhu  Osmotic stress caused by drought and salinity has been a major
              selective force in plant evolution and an important factor influencing plant
              growth and development.  Understanding the mechanisms by which plants detect
              and respond to osmotic stress is of critical importance not only for aspects of
              basic plant biology but also for efforts to improve crop performance under
              adverse environmental conditions.  Dr. Zhu proposes to unravel the mechanism
              osmotic stress signal transduction by studying several mutations in the model
              plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  These mutations cause aberrant regulation of
              stress responsive genes.  Detailed genetic, molecular, biochemical and
              physiological characterization of the mutants will be carried out to establish
              the specific functions of the wild type genes in plant tolerance to drought and
              salinity.  One of the genes will be genetically mapped at high resolution in
              order to have it cloned.  The proposed studies will enhance our understanding
              of how plant cells respond to osmotic stress and improve our ability to develop
              rational strategies for breeding stress-resistant crops.
