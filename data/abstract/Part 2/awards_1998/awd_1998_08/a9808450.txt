Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Yale University to acquire a 400   MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research on a number of   projects
              ranging from synthesis of natural products and other   biologically active
              compounds to elucidation of reaction mechanisms,   transition metal chemistry,
              organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and   development of reagents for
              stereocontrolled synthesis.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
              the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances,
              characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study
              the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
