Abstract    :
              UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA  PEPPER  EEC-9808028    This award to the University of
              Arizona is to study the feasibility of establishing an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Water Quality.  The proposed center will create
              new scientific knowledge on the physical, chemical, and microbial processes
              that affect the quality of surface and subsurface water, and transfer the
              knowledge to industry.  The initial portfolio of research projects, and the
              structure and organization of the proposed center will be discussed at an
              industry/university workshop to be held at the end of the grant period.
