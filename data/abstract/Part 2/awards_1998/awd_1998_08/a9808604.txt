Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist faculty in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at
              the California Institute of Technology to acquire an Electron Paramagnetic
              Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.  The new instrument will support the research of
              six major users.  Among the research programs in which EPR spectroscopy will
              play a vital role are: 1) interactions of radicals with DNA; 2) organometallic
              approaches to hydrocarbon oxidations; 3) biophysical investigations of
              metalloproteins; 4) studies of oxygen activation in heme proteins; 5)
              long-range electron transfer in binuclear metal complexes; 6) electron transfer
              process in iron and copper proteins; 7) electron transfer triggered protein
              folding; 8) studies of polypeptide motifs as platforms for metal cation
              sensing; and 9) investigations of the enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase.

An
              electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to
              obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules.
              It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
              which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety
              of chemical reactions.
