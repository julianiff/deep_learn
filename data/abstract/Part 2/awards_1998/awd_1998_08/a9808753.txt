Abstract    :
              Seemann  9808753         Since the start of the industrial revolution, the
              concentration of C02  in the earth's atmosphere has risen by approximately 30%,
              primarily as a  result of fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes, and is 
              conservatively projected to double by the end of the 21st   century. 
              Photosynthesis, the major physiological process in the biosphere and the  only
              biological process that removes a significant amount of C02 from the 
              atmosphere, is itself extremely sensitive to C02 concentration. In the  short
              term (hours to days) following exposure to 21st  century C02  concentrations,
              the rate of photosynthesis is substantially increased, but  in the long term
              (days to weeks) it may be significantly reduced as a  result of an
              "acclimation" of photosynthesis, a process characterized by a  reduction in the
              level of components of the photosynthetic apparatus. This  acclimation
              phenomenon will have significant effects on both the global  carbon cycle and
              ecosystem structure and function, but its biochemical and  molecular basis are
              poorly understood. Furthermore, plant species may  differ substantially in the
              extent that they may acclimate photosynthetic  capacity to elevated atmospheric
              C02. The objectives of this research  project are to: (1) understand the
              biochemical pathway(s) by which plants  sense elevated C02 and signal changes
              in the expression of genes for  photosynthesis; (2) identify the molecular
              mechanisms that in fact alter  gene expression and consequently photosynthesis
              at elevated C02; and (3)  determine the biochemical and molecular bases for
              species differences in  photosynthetic acclimation to elevated C02,
