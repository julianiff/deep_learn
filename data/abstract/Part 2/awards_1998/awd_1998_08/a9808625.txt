T-DNA insertional mutagenesis will be used to identify
              plant genes that are expressed in a cell or tissue-specific manner in nodule
              and/or lateral root development and that control nodule and/or lateral root
              development.  Binary vectors with a promoterless B-gluronidase (uidA, gus)
              reporter gene adjacent to the T-DNA border are used.  Up to 2,500 transgenic
              lines will be generated by Agrobacterium transformation protocols and screened
              for GUS expression and mutant phenotypes.  The most promising marker lines and
              mutants will be characterized by segregation analysis and expression patterns. 
              cDNAs will be isolated and used to determine the genomic sequences responsible
              for the desired markers and mutations.  Other types of characterizations will
              also be done.

Genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for nodule
              formation will be investigated using the model legure Lotus japonicus.  The
              approach used will involve using insertional mutagenesis with a T-DNA vector
              carrying a promoterless uidA tracer gene.  The working hypothesis that nodule
              and lateral root development are related will be investigated also by the
              insertional mutagenesis approach.  The success of this project will add
              significantly to insight into legume nodule formation, a process central to
              life as we know it
