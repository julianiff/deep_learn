Biochemical and Structural Studies of Gamma-Tubulin in
              Arabidopsis

Abstract

Microtubule arrays are essential for cell division
              and morphogenesis in plant cells, but how these arrays assemble and rearrange
              is largely unknown.  In animal and fungal cells a protein called gamma-tubulin
              is important for microtubule assembly.  In animal cells gamma-tubulin forms
              large ring-shaped complexes that nucleate microtubule assembly and remain
              attached to the microtubule ends.  In plant cells gamma-tubulin is also
              present, but how it associates with microtubules is unclear.  Ring complexes
              have not yet been identified, and whether or how gamma-tubulin might control
              microtubule assembly is unknown.  The overall goal of this project is to
              clarify the functions of gamma-tubulin in plant cells.  The first specific goal
              is to determine if gamma-tubulin forms ring complexes in cells of Arabidopsis
              thaliana and if they do form, to purify them and determine their ability to
              nucleate microtubule assembly.  The second specific goal is to determine
              whether purified Arabidopsis gamma-tubulin binds in vitro at the ends of
              microtubules or along their sides.  Evidence for ring complexes and nucleation
              of assembly by gamma-tubulin will support an important role of gamma-tubulin in
              formation of microtubule arrays in plant cells in vivo.  If gamma-tubulin
              behaves differently in plant cells than in animal cells, the studies will
              establish a good starting point to determine the actual functions of this
              protein in plant cells.
