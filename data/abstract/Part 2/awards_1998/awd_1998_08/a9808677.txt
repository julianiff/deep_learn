This Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              is a collaboration between Stanford University, the University of California at
              Davis and IBM Almaden Research Center.  The MRSEC focuses on the interface
              science of polymeric and surface-active molecules that will enable advances in
              information technologies. The Center also provides seed funding for new
              opportunities in materials research.  The Center supports regional, national
              and international outreach efforts that impact education at all levels,
              including summer research experiences for undergraduates, international
              exchanges of students and faculty, development of instructional materials for
              high school students and materials science education of the general public
              through a regional museum.  The MRSEC also supports shared experimental
              facilities that are accessible to center participants and to outside users, and
              broad industrial outreach efforts.

Research in this Center, which has been
              named the Center on Polymer Interfaces and Macromolecular Assemblies, is
              organized into two interdisciplinary research groups.  One group investigates
              the structure, dynamics and properties of polymers confined to surfaces and
              interfaces with the goal of understanding lubrication and adhesion processes at
              the molecular level.  A second group emphasizes the development of thin film
              polymeric membranes as biomolecular materials for sensor and diagnostic
              applications.  Participants in the Center currently include 17 senior
              investigators, 11 postdoctoral associates, 13 graduate students, 10
              undergraduates, and 3 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor
              Curtis W. Frank directs the MRSEC.
