Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry   at Texas
              Tech University to purchase a 400 MHz liquid phase nuclear   magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectrometer.   This equipment will enhance   research in a number of
              areas such as the following: (1) covalent   modification of antigenic peptides
              by the quinonoid sponge metabolite   puupehenone, (2) synthesis and solid
              solution phase structures of   biologically active substance P analogs, (3)
              synthetic organic hosts for   the recognition of ionic guests, (4) catalysts
              for asymmetric reactions   and (5) the synthesis of taxol derivatives.  Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance   (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for   the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify   unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within   molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in   solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to  
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these   NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in   biology.
