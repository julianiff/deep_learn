Abstract    :
              Abstract  9808701  Zhou        Plants have evolved a number of biochemical
              mechanism to resist attack  by pathogenic organisms.  One mechanism which is
              the subject of this research.  In tomato, plants which have the resistance gene
              Pto are resistant to Pseudomonas syringae  strains which express the gene
              avrPto.  The Pto protein is a cytoplasmic protein kinase, which interacts with
              AvrPto inside the plant cell.  These investigators have been looking for
              signaling components of this reaction, and have identified a serine/threonine
              kinase Ptil, which is a substrate of Pto kinase and seems to act downstream of
              Pto.  They found that Pto also interacts with a class of transcription factors
              in tomato - Pti4, Pti5 and Pti6 which bind to a promoter of disease resistance
              genes.  The focus of this research  is to study the in vivo functions of the
              Pti proteins by looking at Pti mutants which do not interact with Pto, the
              effect of antisense RNA on Pti function and looking at he expression of the Pti
              proteins. This research will  provide new information on the Pto-mediated
              signaling mechanisms, and also provide more information on the defense
              responses in disease resistance.            Higher plants have the ability to
              sense and ward off invading pathogens.   The mechanism  by which this occurs is
              not known at the molecular level.  These studies will characterize 4 tomato
              genes that play a role in plant defense.  These studies will broaden our
              knowledge of plant-microbe interactions.
