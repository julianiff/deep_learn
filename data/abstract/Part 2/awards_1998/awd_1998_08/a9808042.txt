              Lasers    Abstract    This research  project is a preliminary investigation of
              the quantum optical states of semiconductor laser emission. Specifically, a
              complete measeaurement of the quantum states will be made using the newly
              developed techniques of optical homodyne tomograpgy. The goal of this
              investigation is to gain a clear understanding of the quantum state and to
              control the field statistics in order to achieve Heisenberg limited emission.
              The generation of Heisenberg limited, photon-number squeezed optical field will
              enable a wide range of fundamental studies in quantum optics.
