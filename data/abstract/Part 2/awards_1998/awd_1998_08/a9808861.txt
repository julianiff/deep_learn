Abstract    :
              IBN 98-08861 LI (Christine).  Different components of the nervous  system
              communicate with each other through the use of chemical  messengers.  These
              chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, are  strictly regulated within the body.
               Imbalances in the levels of  neurotransmitters can have severe effects on the
              behavior of an  animal.  For instance, decreased levels of the neurotransmitter
               dopamine is the basis of the behavioral deficits seen in patients  with
              Parkinson's Disease.  The laboratory of Dr. Christine Li has  been examining
              the regulation of neurotransmitters in a simple  model system, the roundworm
              Caenorhabditis elegans.  C. elegans  offers many experimental advantages, such
              as ease of genetic  manipulations and generation of transgenic animals. Dr. Li
              has  been examining a specific family of neurotransmitters, the "FLP 
              neuropeptides", in C. elegans.  There are over 50 similar, but  distinct
              members of the FLP family in C. elegans.  The goal of her  lab is to elucidate
              the function of these different transmitters  and to determine how these
              chemicals signal to other parts of the  nervous system.  Thus far, it appears
              that despite the structural  similarities between different FLP transmitters,
              they have  different roles in C. elegans, and are present in different parts 
              of the nervous system.  This research may give insights into the  function of
              homologous transmitters in mammals, such as humans,  and reveal how these
              chemicals are used for communication among  different parts of the mammalian
              nervous system.
