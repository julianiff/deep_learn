Abstract    :
              9808508  Thunell    This award supports a sediment trap calibration-study of the
               climate record preserved in the Santa Barbara Basin, California.   The current
              sediment trapping and hydrographic monitoring program  in this basin will be
              extended for an additional two years in order  to capture the sedimentary
              response to the strong El Nino  conditions that were present throughout 1998 in
              the eastern  Pacific.  This will allow verification of the various biotic, 
              geochemical and stable isotopic proxies of climate change that   have been
              accurately recording the anomalous conditions associated  with this El Nino.
