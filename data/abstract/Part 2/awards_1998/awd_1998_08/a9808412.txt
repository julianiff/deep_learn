Abstract    :
              9808412  Wolberger         Genes in eukaryotes are frequently regulated by
              multiprotein complexes that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and control
              mRNA transcription.  This type of transcriptional regulation, termed
              combinatorial control, is thought to make possible the more complex regulatory
              networks found in higher eukaryotes.  The structural studies described in these
              studies are aimed at gaining insight into the molecular basis of combinatorial
              control mediated by homeodomain proteins.  The 2.35   crystal structure will be
              determined of the yeast (2 homeodomain bound DNA, thereby extending the
              resolution and accuracy of the existing model of that complex.  The
              crystallization and x-ray structure determination will also be carried out on
              an a1/(2-DNA complex containing a triple-alanine mutant with unusual
              DNA-binding properties.  The crystal structure of the Tup1 protein, a general
              transcriptional repressor that is recruited by (2, will be determined from
              crystals of a 50 kD fragment of the protein.  Analytical ultracentrifugation
              experiments will also be carried out to determine whether this fragment is
              capable of binding to the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4, an
              interaction that has been proposed to be part of the mechanism of repression by
              the Tup1 protein.  Attempts will also be made to co-crystallize the Tup1
              protein with an a1/(2 N-terminal domain heterodimer, which recruits Tup1 in
              yeast.  To extend these studies of combinatorial control to other proteins, the
              structure of the human HoxB1/Pbx 1 homeodomain heterodimer bound to DNA will be
              determined from crystals diffracting to 2.35   resolution.    The goal of this
              research is to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular details of gene
              regulation by the yeast MAT (2 protein, which is widely regarded as a paradigm
              for the study of combinatorial control of transcription.  The higher resolution
              structure of (2 alone bound to DNA will help elucidate remaining questions
              about DNA-binding specificity, while the struct ure of the a1/(2-DNA complex
              containing a mutant (2 protein with all three major groove-contacting side
              chains to alanine will make possible an understanding of the unexpected ability
              of the mutant heterodimer to bind DNA with near-wild type affininty.  The
              structure and solution studies of the Tup1 protein will be the first of a
              general yeast repression factor and will aid in an understanding of how (2
              represses transcription in vivo through recruitment of Tup1.  The insights
              gained from the (2 system will be broadened to other systems through the
              structural study of the HoxB1/Pbx1-DNA complex, which is a human homologue with
              many features in common with the yeast a1 and (2 proteins.
