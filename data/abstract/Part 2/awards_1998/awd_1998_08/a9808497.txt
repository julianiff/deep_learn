Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Washington   University to
              purchase a  300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)   spectrometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   such as the following:
              (1) the synthesis of complex organic molecules,   (2) the use of combinatorial
              technology in the development of new ligands   for transition metal catalyzed
              asymmetric reactions, (3) organometallic   solution-liquid -solid growth of
              ternary III-V semiconductor   nanowhiskers, (4) the molecular design of
              silylenes, (5) the   identification and preparation of pure site-specific  
              photoproduct-containing DNA, and (6) synthetic polymer chemistry.     Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
