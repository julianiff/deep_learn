Price
This proposal is on research which would demonstrate a system
              whereby the motion of a subject/patient undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging
              (MRI) examination is monitored in near real-time and the information is fed
              back to the MRI scanner to produce "motion-free" images.  The need for
              effective motion correction is to make it possible to study important study
              groups (particularly children) and patients who can not lie still for long
              imaging sessions.  This research will evaluate two methods of motion
              correction, each method integrates a three dimensional tracking device (POLARIS
              Optical Position Tracking System-OPTS) with a conventional MR scanner.  These
              methods include: (1) an off-line post-processing method utilizing a Siemens
              SP-4000 scanner, and (2) an on-line near real-time method utilizing a General
              Electric Echospeed (5.X) scanner.  This proposed research has the potential to
              produce important advances in MRI technology.
