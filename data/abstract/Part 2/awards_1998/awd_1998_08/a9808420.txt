              NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  9808420    PI: John B. Phillips     
              Many species of animals can return to their homes from great  distances. 
              Studies of homing orientation by the eastern red-  spotted newt Notophthalmus
              viridescens will investigate the  use of spatial variation in one component of
              the earth's  magnetic field, magnetic inclination, to derive one  coordinate of
              a bicoordinate navigational map used in  homing.  The newts responses to small
              changes in magnetic  inclination in the laboratory will be used to estimate 
              characteristics of the local gradient of magnetic  inclination in the vicinity
              of their home pond.  The  estimates derived from the newts' behavior will then
              be  compared with actual measured values of the spatial gradient  of magnetic
              inclination to determine whether this gradient  is being used to derive one map
              coordinate.  In addition,  since magnetic inclination is the angular difference
              between  the magnetic and gravity field vectors, a separate series of 
              behavioral experiments will be carried out to determine the  sensitivity of the
              newt's gravitational responses.      The proposed experiments will contribute
              to a better  understanding of the role of  the earth's magnetic field in 
              animal navigation.  In addition, because of the high level  of sensitivity that
              is required to derive map information  from the geomagnetic field, these
              experiments will help to  determine the lower limits of the sensitivity of a 
              biological system to variation in the geomagnetic field and,  at a more general
              level, the precision with which the  vertebrate nervous system can measure
              physical stimuli.
