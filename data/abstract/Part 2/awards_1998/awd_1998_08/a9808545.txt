Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist  the Department of Chemistry at George   Washington University to
              acquire thermal analysis instrumentation for   polymer, inorganic and materials
              research.  This equipment includes a   differential scanning calorimeter and
              differential thermal analysis and   thermogravimetric analysis instrumentation.
              This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas including (i) low
              temperature solution   routes to non-oxide ceramics, (ii) characterization of
              monodisperse rigid   rod polymers, (iii) synthesis of covalently bound
              organometallic   compounds, and (iv) the study of electron-phonon coupling in
              cuprates.    Differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis
              and   thermal gravimetric analysis are basic tools of materials chemistry and  
              science.  They provide fundamental information on the thermal stability   and
              characteristics of novel materials.
