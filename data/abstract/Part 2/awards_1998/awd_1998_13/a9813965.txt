	"Physics-2000 Popularizing Modern Physical Sciences
              through Virtual Interactive Experiments".  This project involves a professional
              staff of programmers and artists to develop science units in various
              presentation schemes in conjunction with faculty, graduate students,
              undergraduates, and high school teachers in an effort which integrates research
              and education.  Physics-2000 is a multi-disciplinary educational-technology
              project which aims to bring to students, educators and the general public an
              accessible set of interactive virtual experiments embedded in a popular
              exposition of the underlying science; all made available on the Internet.  This
              activity is being joint funded by PHY and OMA.
