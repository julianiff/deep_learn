This US-Brazil collaborative research proposal between Dr.
              Jaan Valsiner and colleagues, Clark University, Worcester, MA, and Drs. Maria
              D. C. P de Lyra, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Angela U. Branco,
              Universidade de Brasilia, is a two-year, multi-disciplinary study of
              development of human communicative processes in different socio-cultural
              contexts.  This study in metacommunications will involve the PI, eight U.S.
              researchers, and 4 graduate students in developmental psychology and education.
               Each researcher will focus on a different, but related factor of
              socio-cultural psychology ranging from the investigation of language
              development in different cultures, the mechanisms of national identity,
              formation, and maintenance, human adaption to varied physical and family
              environments including stress generated by low income economies, and issues
              ofviolence in personal relations.  Brazilian teams will gain further
              elaboration of their research methodologies - especially in the area of
              statistical data analysis, while US scientists will extend their perspectives
              by gaining a better perspective on the phenomena of communicative and
              metacommunicative processes in the context of a different society - one whose
              academic background is based upon a French model.  Presentation of findings is
              expected at a international conference in 2000 and in the publicaiton of joint
              research papers.
