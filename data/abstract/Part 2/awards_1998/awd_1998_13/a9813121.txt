Abstract    :
              Research performed under this grant will develop methods to rapidly assess early
              engineering designs.  To assess many designs using conventional approaches
              requires a significant and often economically infeasible amount of computation.
               The approach to rapid assessment of early designs to be researched under this
              grant utilizes set-based representations of early design descriptions thereby
              permitting approximate assessment of the performance of regions or sets of the
              design space.  This work will extend initial results to efficient mapping of
              sets in high dimensional design spaces, and to design problems with realistic
              mappings (nonmonotonic performance evaluation functions).       The results of
              this research will permit engineering designers to rapidly and inexpensively
              determine the approximate region of performance that a candidate set of designs
              will exhibit.  Set-based design can increase concurrency by permitting
              information to be passed to downstream or parallel groups as sets of possible
              designs.  These results will permit designers to exchange imprecise, partially
              complete, design information to accelerate the design process and shorten the
              engineering design cycle.
