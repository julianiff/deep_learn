Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to invent and develop new technologies for
              interactive querying of online databases which support electronic commerce and
              electronic transactions. The specific problem addressed in this project is that
              if the answer set to a query consists of a very large number of items, users
              may not be able to examine all the answers but rather limit themselves to
              subsets of answers. Consequently, if a user's decision is based only on some
              subset of answers retrieved from the database, certain vendors may end up
              getting preferential treatment. Thus, online databases used in browsing and
              purchasing will be forced to develop "fair" information presentation issues.
              This project aims to develop information presentation strategies for such
              networked environments. A novel approach is being explored to create "fair"
              presentation models based on explicit contracts between vendors and the
              database system. Such contracts specify how often a given object is to be
              displayed in response to relevant user queries. In particular, query processing
              algorithms with respect to the display size of the client are being developed.
              Moreover, a prototype is built to experiment with the theoretical performance
              of the algorithms with respect to scalability. This research will have a
              potentially large impact on the technologies used in information sources for
              electronic commerce, including web search engines, online catalogs, and
              electronic advertising.
