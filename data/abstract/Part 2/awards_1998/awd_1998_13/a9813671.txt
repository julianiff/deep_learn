Title: The
              Surface of the Antarctic Plateau as a Natural Laboratory for Radiation
              Processes in the Global Upper Troposphere: Water Vapor and Ice Clouds


This
              project will provide new information on the infrared absorbing properties of
              water vapor and ice clouds at the very low temperatures present in the upper
              troposphere. The approach is to measure these quantities experimentally using
              ground-based equipment at the South Pole Station, where temperatures and vapor
              amounts approximate those in the high atmosphere at midlatitudes.  Working in
              the natural atmosphere rather than in a confined laboratory space, it is
              possible to use long experimental path lengths and thereby obtain more precise
              data than possible otherwise.  The principal instrument in these experiments is
              a high-resolution interferometer covering the wavelength range from 2 to 40 *m.
               Infrared radiation will be transmitted out and back over a round-trip distance
              of 1 km and the interferometer will be able to estimate the absorption along
              the path.  Instruments to measure the air temperature, vapor content, and type
              and concentration of ice crystals will provide data in support of the
              interferometer measurements.  The result of the work will be a better
              understanding of the radiative properties of ice crystals and water vapor at
              very low temperatures.  This information is needed to improve the accuracy of
              (1) radiative transfer calculations, (2) remote sensing observations of the
              atmosphere from satellites, and (3) the approximations for
