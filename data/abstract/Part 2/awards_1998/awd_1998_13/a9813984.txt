Professor
              Christos Takoudis of U. Illinois at Chicago proposes to utilize surface-enhance
              Raman and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopies to analyze catalytic
              surfaces and intermediates under reaction conditions (up to 550 C).
              Simultaneously, reaction kinetic data will be obtained by means of mass
              spectrometric detection of gas phase species. The catalysts will be prepared by
              electrodeposition on roughened gold surfaces. Reactions to be studied include
              the decomposition and oxidation of alcohols and formic acid on Rh, Pt, Pd and
              Ir, and the oxidation of butadiene on Ag. An extensive range of temperature and
              pressures (up to 1 atm) will be utilized.
