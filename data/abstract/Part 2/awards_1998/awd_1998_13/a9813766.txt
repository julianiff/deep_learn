     This award will provide support for speakers and others,
              in particular,
graduate students, who attended the symposium entitled
              ``Reflections on the
Foundations of Mathematics'' at Stanford University from
              December 11-13, 1998.
The turn of the millenium is an especially appropriate
              time to reflect on the
proof theoretically inspired foundational
              investigations of this century that
have roots in the work of 19th century
              mathematicians, e.g., Dedekind, Cantor,
Frege, and Kronecker.  These
              investigations have been merging over the past
decades with developments in
              set theory and recursion theory; however, their
special emphasis on broad
              philosophical issues has remained prominent.  The
symposium was timed to
              coincide with the 70th birthday of one of the guiding
spirits of foundational
              research over the past four decades, Solomon Feferman,
which served further to
              focus attention on where we have been in this effort
and on where we may be
              going.  Participation by graduate students was of
obvious importance to the
              latter.  The efforts of the organizers to prepare
a detailed agenda and widely
              representative program were rewarded by a
strikingly successful symposium, and
              the proceedings volume that will appear
in due course promises to be a
              valuable and influential resource for the
community for years to come.
