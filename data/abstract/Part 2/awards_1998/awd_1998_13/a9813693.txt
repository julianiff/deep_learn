Abstract    :
              ATM9813693

The investigators will continue studies of ionosphere/thermosphere
              storms using data from the incoherent scatter radar chain, other ground and
              space-based instruments, and theoretical models.  The study concentrates on
              case studies of specific storm intervals, and includes the coordination efforts
              involved in bringing scientists together in collaborative data analysis
              activities.  The storm study is a cooperative effort among scientists in the U.
              S. and overseas concentrating on specific ionosphere/thermosphere storm
              intervals with particularly good data coverage.  The aim is to involve
              interested scientists with F-region/thermosphere data or modeling capabilities
              in coordinated efforts to understand the coupled upper atmospheric regions at
              different heights and on a global scale during geomagnetically disturbed
              conditions.  As the next solar cycle maximum approaches, many more storm
              intervals will become available which can be chosen for coordinated study using
              state of the art models and distributed instruments.  The effort includes
              coordination activities to bring collaborating scientists together to discuss
              the analysis of storm data.  Scientific investigations include storm effects on
              F2 region electron densities, the role of electric fields and neutral winds,
              neutral composition changes, and reduction in ionospheric electron densities
              due to the presence of vibrationally excited species.
