Abstract    :
              Dunning is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue
              his studies of chemical processes induced by high Rydberg atoms.  A
              comprehensive study of the formation and properties of a variety of negative
              ion species will be performed, with emphasis on (1) the dynamics of
              dissociative electron capture at thermal and sub-thermal electron energies, (2)
              the lifetimes of autodetaching species and their stabilization by energy
              transfer via interactions with a second body,  (3) the physical and chemical
              properties of dipole-bound negative ions, and (4) the search for
              quadrupole-bound negative ions.  Outcomes from this research are expected to
              enhance the fundamental understanding of electron exchange between donor and
              acceptor systems.

A large number of chemical reactions involve the transfer
              of electrons between molecules.  Rydberg atom collision methods provide new
              opportunities for improving the understanding of electron exchange processes
              leading to negative ions.  Negative ions and their properties impact various
              practical applications, including plasma processing of materials and the
              development of nonconducting media for high-voltage electrical equipment.
