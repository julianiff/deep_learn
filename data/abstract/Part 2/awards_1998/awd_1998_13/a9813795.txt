Abstract    :
              	Dr. Lindzen continues to investigate a number of topics related to the role of
              equilibration in atmospheric dynamics.  The two broad areas of interest are: 
              (1) potential vorticity mixing and its implications for atmospheric structure,
              and the reduction in growth rates of planetary scale baroclinic instability and
              (2) the enstrophy budget, and its role in limiting the amplitude of forced
              Rossby waves.  These two topics are important for understanding the dynamics
              of, respectively, the extratropical and tropical atmosphere structure and
              critical components in the development of physically based climate models. 
              Particularly interesting should be an observational analysis examining the
              relationship between changes in the sea surface temperatures associated with El
              Nino events and changes in the intensity of the Hadley circulation.   

In
              addition, Dr. Lindzen will continue to study stationary Rossby waves in general
              and including their interactions with ice sheets.  He will look at both the
              contribution of ice sheet to the formation of Rossby waves and, in turn, their
              influence on the development and ablation of the ice sheets.  This is important
              not only in its application to present day ice sheets, but potentially could be
              useful in understanding ice age glaciations and deglaciations.
