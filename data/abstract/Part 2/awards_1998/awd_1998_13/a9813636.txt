Abstract    :
                          Abstract  EEC-9813636  Mudgil & Rajagopalan    The purpose of this
              award is to broaden the scope, and enhance the quality of the research program
              of the ERC for Particle Science and Technology at the University of Florida by
              implementing a collaborative research program with Princeton University. Other
              participants of this collaborative effort are: Center for Research and
              Education in Optics and Laser, and NASA's Space Shuttle Microgravity
              Laboratory. The specific focus of this project is on the fundamental issues
              relevant to crystal growth, phase transition, and formation of nanocrystalline
              materials. Charged colloids will be used as models of condensed matter to
              investigate atomic level dynamics of nanocrystalline and nanostructured
              materials. The experiments will include direct visualization and optical
              manipulation of the microstructures. The data will be examined by a variety of
              theoretical techniques. The fundamental understanding gained from this
              collaborative effort will be applicable to the ERC's Engineered Particulates
              Thrust and Dispersion, Agglomeration, and Consolidation Thrust.
