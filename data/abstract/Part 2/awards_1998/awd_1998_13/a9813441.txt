The investigators propose to continue an atmospheric sampling
              program that was initiated in winter 
1997-98 with a pilot program at 10,600
              feet altitude at the summit of the Greenland Ice Cap. The 1997-98 pilot project
              was the first attempt to measure atmospheric chemistry during the winter season
              and the first attempt by NSF to support a science team at the Summit station
              during winter conditions.  The scientific success of the pilot project and the
              logistics lessons learned prove that the proposed continuation of a winterover
              sampling program is a viable method for determining the variables that control
              the transfer of the atmospheric chemistry into the ice core record. The
              calibration of the atmospheric chemical record with the snowfall record will be
              used to determine how the atmospheric record is transferred into the ice
              record.  The ultimate goal is to interpret the past atmospheric chemistry using
              samples of the Greenland Ice Sheet Two (GISP2) project ice core that was
              collected previously at the site. The100,000 year annual record of the GISP2
              ice core will provide the opportunity to examine the record of atmospheric
              changes from both natural and anthropogenic causes.
