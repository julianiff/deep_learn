Abstract    :
              9812800  Marc Rotenberg  Association for Computing Machinery    Special Project:
               Student Fellows Programs at ACM Policy 98 Conference     This grant provides
              funding for twelve policy98 Student Fellows to attend and participate in the
              ACM Policy98 Conference.  The conference provides a multidisciplinary forum
              planned to stress the contributions that computer professionals can make in
              policy-making by providing informed testimony and expanded policy options.  The
              purpose is to forge stronger links between computing professionals and policy
              makers.  The conference includes distinguished keynote speakers, technical
              panels and workshops and is primarily funded and administered by ACM.  The
              twelve Fellows that will be funded by this grant all have strong interests in
              public policy issues and several are pursuing graduate degrees in this and
              related topics.
