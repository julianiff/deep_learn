This one-year US-France dissertation enhancement award
              supports collaborative research between graduate student, Randi Smith Bessette
              of the University of Maryland, and Thierry Vedel of the French National
              Foundation for Political Science.  Ms. Bessette is a student of Ernest Wilson,
              Director of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at
              the University of Maryland.  Ms. Bessette will spend three months in France
              investigating the development of French policies regulating encryption. 
              Encryption, the technology that employs mathematical formulas to secure data
              and communications, is a controversial public policy issue.  Long under the
              exclusive purview of the intelligence community during the Cold War, encryption
              now represents a flashpoint of modern conflict among scientific, business,
              national security/law enforcement, and civil libertarian communities.  Public
              demand for encryption has multiplied with the spread of the personal computer
              and the development of the Internet.  With a shift of activity into the private
              sector, governments worldwide are trying to decide whether and how to control
              this technology.  In the early 1990s, France implemented one of the strictest
              encryption control policies in the world, whereby the import, export, and
              domestic use of encryption were heavily regulated by the government.  In 1996
              France gradually relaxed these restrictions.  The objective of the research is
              to examine first-hand what influenced the recent changes in French government
              policy.  Using France as a case study, the project will examine the political
              relationship between government and the scientific community and broad
              international political and economic factors reshaping modern state-scientist
              relations.
