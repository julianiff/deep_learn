Abstract    :
              OCE 98-13451  Dilek  Proposal is for support of a Penrose Conference on
              "Ophiolites and Oceanic Crust: New Insights from Field Studies and Ocean
              Drilling Program" for supplemental funds to cover one month of salary during
              conference planning and execution, for funds to publish results, and for
              associated conference costs that include a fieldtrip and subsidization of
              travel costs for conference attendees.  The conference is designed to bring
              together both marine and land scientists for  discussion of multidisciplinary
              studies involving the nature and origin of the oceanic crust. Emphasis will be
              placed on integrating recent Ocean Drilling Program drilling results from a
              variety of oceanic environments with recent studies of ophiolitic land
              analogues, with special emphasis on results from the Oman and Troodos
              ophiolites. Specific ODP results to be discussed include those resulting from
              drilling in upper oceanic crust near a mid-ocean ridge (Costa Rica Rift),
              tectonic exposures of middle to lower oceanic crust and mantle (Mid-Atlantic
              Ridge, Hess Deep, and Southwest Indian Ridge), and tectonic environments
              associated with oceanic volcanic arcs (Lau Basin, Tonga forearc, and
              Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc and backarc).  This Penrose Conference will augment
              the objectives and activities of the ODP Architecture of the Oceanic
              Lithosphere Program Planning Group.  It will consist of a three day meeting for
              70 participants, followed by a fieldtrip and a day of informal discussions, to
              be held 9/13/98-9/17/98.  ***
