Abstract    :
              Professors Paul Sides and David Sholl will investigate the origin of the
              morphological instability occurring during homoepitaxial chemical vapor
              deposition of CdTe thin films from organometallic precursors.  They will use
              Monte Carlo Simulations and continuum growth models as well as experiments of
              CdTe deposition on (100), (110), (111)CD and (111)Te.  Morphology will be
              determined with nomarsky and scanning tunneling microscopy in a time-resolved
              manner, and the observations will be compared with the simulations.  A new
              monoloayer-sentitive technique will be developed based on scattered total
              internal reflection infrared spectroscopy.  Radiaiton below 900 nm will be
              directed through the crystal towards the CdTe-vapor interface with the purpose
              of detecting the appearance of steps.  The hypothesis that Schwoebel barriers
              are responsible for the morphological instability of CdTe deposited by OMVPE
              will be tested.
