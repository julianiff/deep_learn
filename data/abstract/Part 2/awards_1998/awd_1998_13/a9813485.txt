The Third International Mathematics and Science
              Study(TIMSS)has exposed serious weaknesses in the ways U.S. students are
              learning math and sciece.  Although our students have been improving in math
              and science, they have also been slipping behind, relative to other countries. 
              The TIMSS results have generated calls within the U.S. educational community
              for increased rigor in both science and mathematics, and for a stronger
              foundation to math and science in middle grades.  This is an an appropriate
              response, perhaps, but it carries with it the danger that rigor will be
              misconstrued as "more" or "earlier," but not "deeper" understanding.  We have
              the an opportunity to take advantage of  the current call for change math and
              science learning to develop deeper, cross-disciplinary ways to acquire and
              organize scientific understanding.  We can do this by employing the full power
              of modern information technologies.
