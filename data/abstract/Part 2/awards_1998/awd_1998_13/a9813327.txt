Abstract    :
              	This award is one of two made to provide support for a collaborative research
              project.  The companion award is to Dr. Mahowald, University of California at
              Santa Barbara (ATM-9902987).

	The project involves the development of a
              chemical transport model in isentropic coordinates.  Isentropic coordinates
              have the advantage of potentially better capturing the transport
              characteristics of the atmosphere because they represent surfaces of neutral
              buoyancy and, thus, are a more natural coordinate for transport.  The starting
              point is an existing chemical transport model, the MATCH model developed at the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research.  This model's vertical coordinate
              will be converted to an isentropic system and the sub-grid scale mixing and
              boundary layer mixing parameterizations modified accordingly.  It is expected
              that, in particular, the model will better capture the nature of the transport
              near the tropopause and thereby contribute to better understanding of
              stratospheric-tropospheric exchange processes.  The principal investigators
              will test the model's realism by comparing simulations of trace gas transport
              with other model results and with observations.

	This project is supported
              jointly by the Atmospheric Chemistry and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology
              Programs.
