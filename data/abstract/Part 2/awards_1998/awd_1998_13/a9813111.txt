Abstract    :
              9813111
     The project will develop neutron computed tomography for use in
              various scientific and industrial applications.  The theoretical part will
              focus on developing improved image reconstruction algorithms that are best
              suited for reconstructions from neutronic projections.  The experimental part
              will consist of a series of tests using data obtained from Monte Carlo
              simulations as well as data from actual experimental measurements.  The project
              will address one of the most important and challenging problems in neutron
              tomography due to the multiple scattering of the neutron ray inside the object.
               The neutron scattering can cause considerable image blurring.  To overcome
              this limitation, more recent approaches such as the
              slow-evolution-from-the-continuation-boundary method will be investigated and
              the performance of the newly developed methods will be compared with those
              obtained from the classical methods.  Other aspects of importance to image
              reconstruction from neutronic projections will be investigated.  These include
              the application of wavelets to edge detection and the development and
              implementation of parallel algorithms.
     The significance of this research
              emanates from the growing need for nondestructive evaluation techniques with
              certain desirable properties.  Neutrons have attractive properties including
              strong attenuation by hydrogenous materials, high penetrability through
              metallic and highly dense materials, and inherent sensitivity to elemental and
              isotopic variations.
