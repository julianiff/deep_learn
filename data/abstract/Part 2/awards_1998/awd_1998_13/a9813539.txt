This project is part of the SCICEX program,
              which makes use of U.S. Navy nuclear submarines as a research platform. This is
              a joint science program between the Arctic Natural Sciences Program, the Office
              of Naval Research and the operational Navy. This project will analyze samples
              collected on the SCICEX 98 cruise and will collect and analyze samples from the
              upcoming SCICEX 99 cruise. The scientific goal is to map the distribution,
              pathways, and mean residence times of the surface and halocline waters of the
              Arctic Ocean by means of a number of chemical tracers. This information is
              important for our understanding of the shelf/basin exchange, the freshwater
              distribution and circulation, the impact of freshwater on the stability of the
              stratification of the upper waters, and the possible effect of variability in
              the freshwater export
from the Arctic on deep-water formation in the
              Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian (GIN) and Labrador seas. Additionally, these data
              contribute to filling the gaps in the tracer database used for model
              calibration. The new data will be combined with tracer data sets from previous
              SCICEX and icebreaker cruises and interpreted in terms of the goals of this
              project outlined above. This project will provide new results from the Arctic
              Ocean on the surface water circulation and freshwater balance.

During the
              SCICEX 98 cruise the team collected 64 oxygen isotope, 64 tritium, 64 helium
              isotope, and 64 chloroflurocarbon (CFC) samples at 4 surface stations. During
              SCICEX 99, the science team will collect 10 samples per spiral station for
              oxygen isotopes, helium isotopes and tritium at a total of 24 spirals stations.
              The ten samples include 8 depth levels plus 2 replicates.  A new sampling
              method will be applied for CFCs  (there were problems with CFC
              contamination
using the flame sealing method in the interior of the submarine
              during the 97 cruise). The samples will be collected and stored in copper
              tubes. Using this new method, 50 CFC samples will be collected at 5 of the
              spiral stations. Additionally, about 200 underway oxygen isotope
samples will
              be collected. For both the SCICEX 98 and 99 cruises a total of  304 tritium,
              304 helium isotope, 114 CFC, and 500 oxygen isotope samples will be
              analyzed.
