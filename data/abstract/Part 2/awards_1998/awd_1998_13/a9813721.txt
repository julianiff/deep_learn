Abstract    :
              In this project, three researchers, and a team of graduate students, from
the
              University of California, San Diego (UCSD), shall undertake
theoretical and
              experimental investigations of data modulation schemes for
efficient
              information transmission in conjunction with CDMA encoded
ultrashort pulses in
              an optical fiber. Efficient modulation formats will
result in aggregate
              transmission rates exceeding one terabit/second, with
individual user rates on
              the order of 100-1000 megabit/second. The specific
objectives of this project
              include modeling of the CDMA, statistical
analysis of the transmitted
              waveforms, investigation of various CDMA codes
that support thousands of users
              with minimal interference, bit error rate
analysis of received signals for
              various modulation schemes, means to
provide QOS levels, modeling and
              characterization of the distortions
induced by the fiber channel, adaptive
              equalization techniques for reducing
fiber distortions, computer simulations
              of the modulation schemes, and
experimental evaluation of the modulation
              schemes, transmitter, optical
channel, and receiver. The goal of this proposal
              is to demonstrate a
prototype network with several users employing a
              modulation format which
when scaled up to the full number of users will carry
              over one terabit per
second of information.

The potential impact of the
              work will be in the proof that CDMA encoding of
ultrashort pulses is a
              realizable and desirable alternative to wavelength
division multiplexing
              (WDM).
