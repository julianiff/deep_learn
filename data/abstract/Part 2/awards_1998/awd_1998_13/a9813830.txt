Abstract    :
              The investigators will establish a latitudinal chain of all-sky imaging systems
              to enable CEDAR-TIMED studies of small-scale gravity waves and their effects
              upon the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. CEDAR, which stands for Coupling,
              Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change program
              that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to study the
              upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere, Ionosphere,
              Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to study
              similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to
              coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better
              understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere. 
              The three imagers that make up the chain will be located at the Bear Lake
              Observatory in northern Utah, the Starfire Optical Facility in New Mexico, and
              in Grand Junction, Colorado. The all-sky cameras will be deployed and operated
              in collaboration with investigators from Utah State University and University
              of California at Berkeley.
