The investigators will use a coupled
              thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere model to study the low latitude
              thermosphere and ionosphere under quiet and magnetically disturbed conditions. 
              The purpose is to understand the interactions between dynamics, plasma density,
              and electrodynamics in response to geomagnetic storms.  The quiet-time low
              latitude thermosphere and ionosphere exhibit interesting feedback interactions
              that give rise to features such as the equatorial ionization anomaly, the
              pre-reversal enhancement of the eastward electric field, high velocity neutral
              winds at the magnetic equator, neutral peaks in the post sunset anomaly, and
              large vertical winds co-located with the temperature features.  During a
              geomagnetic storm, changes in the magnetosphere affect the atmosphere through
              electric fields that redistribute ionization.  This in turn modifies neutral
              winds and atmospheric composition.  The researchers will attempt to simulate
              these effects using a sophisticated model that couples the thermosphere,
              ionosphere, and plasmasphere, and they will test the results using ground- and
              space-based measurements.
