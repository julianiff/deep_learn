Abstract    :
              This project will continue an analysis of the atmospheric dynamics in the
              antarctic upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT at altitudes of 70 to
              100 km) from a number of existing data sources, and continue the active
              cooperation with the British Antarctic Survey in operating an MLT radar
              installed at Rothera as part of a prior award.

The Rothera MLT radar
              produces high resolution measurements of the horizontal wind field that can
              define clearly the tidal, planetary wave, and gravity wave activity at the top
              of the neutral atmosphere.  These data will be used to (1) investigate the
              large-scale wave dynamics in conjunction with similar data sets from McMurdo,
              Davis and Syowa stations; (2) investigate the regional structure of mesopause
              by combining Rothera MLT data with satellite data and the results of a
              rocketsonde program at the German antarctic station; and (3) investigate
              inter-hemispheric and global connections through correlative studies with
              northern hemisphere data sets.
