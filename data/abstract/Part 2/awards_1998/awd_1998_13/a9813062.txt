The Widmeyer-Baker Group (TWBG) working in conjunction with
              The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the National Action
              Council for Minorities in Engineering, Incorporated (NACME) proposes to design
              and implement a campaign of Public Understanding and Engagement of Mathematics
              targeted toward national, state, and local audiences. 
	
The primary goal of
              the campaign is to engage the publics' thinking about what students in the
              United States should know and be able to do in mathematics in the middle school
              grades and the reasons mathematics is important to successful careers and to
              live an interesting and productive life.  

The approach will expose a
              diverse cross-section of Americans to mathematics using math puzzles designed
              by NCTM.  TWBG will make widespread use of these camera-ready math puzzles in a
              variety of ways and formats. The primary audience for this campaign is the
              general adult population.  The secondary audience is the middle school students
              and their parents, including persons serving as parent surrogates (i.e.,
              extended family, foster parents,  daycare providers, etc.).

This initiative
              will be a grassroots effort capable of reaching every community throughout the
              United States.  TWBG will be expected to make creative use and/ or
              collaboration with mass media, policy/administrative/teaching and grassroots
              organizations, corporations, and federal and state agencies in dissemination of
              the message about the campaign.
