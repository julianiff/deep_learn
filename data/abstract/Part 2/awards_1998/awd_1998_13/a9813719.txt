	This award provides funds to partially support a research
              conference on probability models to be held at the University of Colorado at
              Colorado Springs, May 28-30, 1999. The purpose of the conference is to bring
              together probabilists, physicists, and biologists with interests in this area
              of research. This is currently an active area of research in probability, and
              these models have applications to problems in physics and biology.
