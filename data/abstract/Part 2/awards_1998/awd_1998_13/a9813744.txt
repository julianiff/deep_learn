Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to explore the  applicability of advanced
              signal processing techniques to  certain problems arising in natural language
              text  processing. Specifically, we seek to evaluate the  effectiveness of using
              multiple hypothesis tracking  concepts, originally developed for radar target
              tracking  applications, to the problem of correlating text-based  messages over
              time.  A key concept in this project involves  treating a natural language
              message or statement as a sensor  report. Such a text message, M, is regarded
              as a random  variable that is related to the underlying truth of a  system's
              state, S, through joint and conditional  probabilities, p(M|S), p(S|M), and
              p(S, M). For example,  p(S|M) is the probability that the true system state is
              S  given that an observation, M in text form, has been  reported. The tracking
              problem is to estimate the most  likely sequence of states Stl, St2, ..., Stk
              given a  sequence of text-based observations, Mtl, Mt2,..., Mtk, of  those
              unknown states. Formulated as a maximum likelihood  estimation problem, this
              can be solved using standard  recursive estimation methods including Viterbi's
              algorithm.
