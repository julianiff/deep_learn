Previous studies have shown that the usual concept of
              strain (first
gradient of displacement) cannot adequately describe the near-
              and
post-failure behavior of granular material under large deviatoric
              loading
condition.  In this research, the concept of using additional
              kinematic
descriptors other than the usual concept of strain will be explored.
               The
overall objective of the work is to develop micro-granular
              mechanical
theories using new kinematic descriptors so that the theories
              are
applicable to the entire range of stress-deformation behavior.

The
              approach employed will be based on a micro-macro approach in which
              the
behavior of an assembly is linked to the properties of
              particles.
Experimental data and computer simulation will form an integral
              part in the
development of the theory.  The developed micro-granular
              mechanical theory
will be implemented to a finite element environment.  The
              model will be
validated by comparing measured and predicted behavior of
              granular
materials under different loading conditions.

The result of this
              research will provide insight into the theoretical
framework of material
              localization and bifurcation in continuum mechanics.
The intrinsic length of
              material, which plays a major role in localized
failure zones, will be
              directly related to the micro-structure.  This
unique feature significantly
              distinguishes this theory from
phenomenologically based models.  The derived
              theories are expected to be
extremely valuable not only to the field of
              micro-granular mechanics but
also to the field of finite element methods in
              the analysis of shear
problems.
