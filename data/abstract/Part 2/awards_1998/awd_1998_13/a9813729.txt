Abstract    :
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform computer simulations of inhomogeneous
              fluids.  The objective of the research is to develop a more comprehensive
              understanding of the structure of the electrochemical interface.   Both Monte
              Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations will be employed using two cell
              geometries.    In one case both bulk and interfacial regions will be considered
              in contact with a finite sized electrode.  In a second cell simulation two
              walls will be infinite electrodes with periodic boundary conditions in the
              other two directions.  An NVT simulation will be used.  Various combinations of
              charged, uncharged, and oppositely charged electrodes will be considered while
              employing both simple and sophisticated model potential functions for water. 
              The results will form the basis for extending formal theoretical approaches
              that employ integral equation and density functional methodologies.  The
              research will be performed in collaboration with Richard Rowley of Brigham
              Young University and Stefan Sokolowski from MCS University in Lublin,
              Poland.

Electrochemistry has industrial importance for both chemical
              synthesis and analysis.  A molecular level understanding of the important
              double layer at the electrode surface could have a significant impact on
              optimizing the design of industrial electrochemical systems.
