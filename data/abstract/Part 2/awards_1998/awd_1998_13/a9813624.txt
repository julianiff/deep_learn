Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9813624  BUCKMELTER    This award is to support the NSF Evaluator
              for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on
              Micro-Engineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico.  The evaluator
              provides survey information on the programs of the I/UCRC to the National
              Science Foundation.  The administration, analysis, and presentation of these
              survey data are used by the I/UCRC Program to assess the progress of the
              individual centers as well as the overall I/UCRC Program for such purposes as
              GPRA, Program Announcements, and budget presentations.  Variance analysis of
              these data serve to indicate areas of potential problems or difficulties in the
              program as well as any individual center.  The NSF is well served by the
              evaluator system in management of this complex program.
