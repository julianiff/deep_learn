Abstract    :
              9813260  Ro  This project is aimed to provide a general framework to  achieve
              robust control of class of systems that are  nonlinear and non-affine in the
              input.  Other additive  mechanical nonlinearities can also be included.  The 
              framework allows to cover a wide variety of computer  controlled mechanisms,
              including electromagnetically driven  systems, underwater ROV's (Remotely
              Operated Vehicles), and  automobile suspension control systems.  To achieve
              this  goal, the research will be divided into three separate 
              tasks,(i)formulating a modified sliding condition and an  equivalent control
              action for non-affine systems with smooth  and invertible input nonlinearities,
              (ii) evaluating the  proposed scheme using a specific example of magnetic servo
               levitation, and (iii) extending the concept to non-affine  systems such as
              underwater vehicles and automobile  suspension systems.  The impact of the
              proposed work is  expected at two levels:  First, a vast number of mechanical 
              systems that involve (a) computer control of  electromechanical systems, and
              (b) nonlinear activation  forces that can be modelled by memoryless
              nonlinearities,  can benefit from this work. Second, the proposed framework 
              can open doors to the development of a more advanced sliding  mode control
              scheme for non-affine systems with nonlinear  actuator dynamics.  ***
