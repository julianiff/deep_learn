Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                       
              9813509                                  Murray    The  principal  investigator
              will convene  an  international  workshop to evaluate the current state of
              knowledge  of  the  extent  and  causal mechanisms of suboxia in the Black 
              Sea.  The  Black Sea is undoubtedly among the most remarkable low-  temperature
              geochemical environments on the Earth's surface,  and  there  is  growing
              recognition that  is  encompasses  a  pervasive   and  expanding  mass  of 
              suboxic  water   whose  chemistry,  physics, and ecology is very poorly 
              understood.  This   is   all   the   more   important   politically   and 
              sociologically because the nations bordering  on  the  Black  Sea  are 
              economically  bound to it  through  dependence  on  fisheries  that  would be
              adversely impacted  by  decreasing  oxygen  conditions.  The principal
              investigator  anticipates  that the workshop would help guide international
              efforts  to  understand and perhaps control the suboxia phenomenon.
