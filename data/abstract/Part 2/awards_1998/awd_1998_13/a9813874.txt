Abstract    :
              The 1998 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures,
              and Protocols for Computer Communication will be held in Vancouver, British
              Columbia, from September 2-4, 1998.  This conference is the premier technical
              meeting that examines the state-of-the-art in computer networks and
              communications.  This proposal request funding to assist fourteen United
              States-based graduate students in attending this meeting.  Participation in
              conferences such as SIGCOMM is an extremely  important part of the graduate
              school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior
              researchers and be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support
              requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would
              otherwise be unable to attend SIGCOMM'98.
