Abstract    :
                           This grant awards travel funds to subsidize the airfare for 10 U.S.
              researchers to participate in the VIth Conference on Laboratory Phonology, to
              be held at York University, United Kingdom, July 2-4, 1998.    The biennial
              Conference on Laboratory Phonology has been an important forum for
              international exchange of theoretical views and recent research results that
              focus on the use of experimental methodology in answering questions about the
              phonological structure of particular languages, and about the nature of
              linguistic sound structuring in general.  The conference to be held this summer
              promises to bring together international scholars around several topics which
              are critical in the current development of phonological theory.  NSF support
              will enable American conferees to present a broad range of current research for
              criticism and discussion with a European audience, and in turn will allow
              American scholars to be exposed to current developments in the historically
              somewhat different British and Continental phonetic and linguistic traditions.
