This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. Leonid
              Polyak at the Ohio State University and Dr. Margo Edwards from the Hawaii
              Mapping Research Group at the University of Hawaii.  They will use the Seafloor
              Characterization and Mapping Pod (SCAMP) which has been installed on a U.S.
              Navy submarine for a dedicated science cruise (SCICEX).  They will obtain
              mapping data from the Arctic Ocean floor to test the hypothesis of the
              existence of a Pleistocene Arctic Ice Sheet.  One of the few reliable methods
              of testing this hypothesis is to directly image the relatively shallow portions
              of the Arctic Ocean seafloor for glacial impact.  SCAMP will provide a unique
              opportunity to obtain these data.  The Principal Investigators will use SCAMP
              to collect backscatter, swath bathymetry, and subbottom profiler data across
              the Chukchi Borderland, parts of the Lomonsov Ridge, and possibly the Canadian
              continental margin. They will attempt to find sub-glacial and ice-marginal
              seafloor features, iceberg plowmarks, glacial-sole markings, ice-marginal
              indicators, and other glacier-related debris flows.  If no direct sub-glacial
              features are revealed, the depth range of iceberg plowmarks will provide
              critical information on the thickness of ice in the Arctic Ocean during glacial
              periods.  Mapping plowmark orientation will allow for the reconstruction of the
              Arctic Ocean paleo-circulation patterns.  The data will be processed by the
              Hawaii Mapping Research Group in collaboration with scientists at
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who were primarily responsible for the
              engineering and development of SCAMP.
