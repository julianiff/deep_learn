A symposium entitled Solid-State Chemistry of Inorganic
              Materials II will be held to provide a comprehensive meeting on recent advances
              in the area of Solid State Chemistry.  Areas to be covered include the
              preparation and characterization of new solid state materials.  The symposium
              will bring together researchers from academics, government and industrial
              laboratories to provide a forum in which to interact and exchange ideas in
              areas that include those mentioned in many of the recommendations appearmg in
              the PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP ON THE PRESENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
              OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS, held January 15-17, 1998.  Symposium
              topics include synthesis and reactivity of materials, electronic and magnetic
              properties, dielectrics and ferroelectrics, composite materials, and new
              materials.  Invited speakers whose participation is vital to the success of the
              symposium, and graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty will be
              supported to facilitate their participation in this national meeting.

The
              rapidly emerging and changing field of solid-state chemistry and materials has
              undergone explosive growth over the past decade both in academic and industrial
              laboratories.  Part of this trend is due to the discovery of new materials with
              important technological applications.
