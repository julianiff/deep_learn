Abstract    :
              9813700  Bock         Global Positioning System (GPS) technology allows near 
              real-tine determination of position anywhere on Earth with  precision in the
              sub-centimeter range. It is making a profound  impact on understanding of
              diverse scientific problems in the  geosciences, including plate motions,
              earthquake cycles, crustal  dynamics, volcanic processes, glacier dynamics, sea
              level changes,  and atmospheric sensing. This award provides funding to support
               part of the infrastructure needed for GPS-based studies by earth  scientists.
              The University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) provides  infrastructure support in
              a number of areas, including data  archiving and data analysis. This award to
              the University of  California at San Diego, a member of the UNAVCO Consortium,
              will  support an archival data base from regional GPS networks that will  be
              available on-line to the geophysics research community.  ***
