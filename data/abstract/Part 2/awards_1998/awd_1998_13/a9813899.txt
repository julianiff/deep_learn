This award supports research and education in quantum
              many-body theory.  The PI seeks exact solutions of quantum many-body problems
              in dimensions greater than one with the goal of understanding the spectrum of
              quantum critical points at the lowest energy scales, enumerating the phases of
              matter that might be separated by these critical points, and searching for a
              link between these critical points and the physics of the vacuum.

This award
              supports research and education at the frontiers of condensed matter theory.
              Motivated by the unusual properties of materials with strongly correlated
              electrons, the PI seeks solvable physical models for interacting electrons that
              have quantum critical points.  These separate distinct phases at zero
              temperature, control crossover behavior observed at finite temperature, may
              involve new states of matter, and might explain unusual electronic properties
              of high temperature superconductors and other strongly correlated electron
              systems.
