ABSTRACT

The National Science Foundation
              is now examining the future roles, number, and support for U.S. mathematical
              sciences institutes, and has suggested that the National Research Council help
              inform that examination.  Specifically, this project would (1) examine the role
              of the institutes in furthering mathematical research; and (2) in the context
              of assuring the future health of the nation's mathematical research enterprise,
              recommend whether any changes in the current configuration of the U.S.
              institutes are warranted--their nature, number, and operating modes.
