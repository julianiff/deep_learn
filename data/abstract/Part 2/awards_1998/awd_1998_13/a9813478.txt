Abstract    :
              This project will document strategies used by local emergency managers to
              coordinate responses to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and other natural
              disasters.  The research has five specific objectives: (1) identify key
              strategies implemented by local emergency managers to coordinate the
              functioning of multi-organizational networks that emerge following natural
              disasters; (2) document the composition and longevity of multi-organizational
              networks that emerge following natural disasters during four time periods; (3)
              identify unanticipated components of multi-organizational networks that emerge
              following natural disasters and document their functions, time and duration of
              mobilization, and degree to which they are integrated into the overall network;
              (4) assess the patterned relationships between the range of strategies used and
              key analytic features of multi-organizational networks that emerge following
              natural disasters, including speed of formation, stability, and shape; and (5)
              disseminate the strategies used and policy implications for community response
              effectiveness to local and state emergency managers.  Data will be collected
              through interviews and questionnaires with a sample of local emergency
              managers.
