Abstract    :
              ATM9813864

The investigators will build and deploy a set of critical
              instruments clustered around the Sondrestrom radar in Greenland.  They will
              operate these instruments for a single extended campaign during the winter
              season in 1999.  The instruments include three radio beacon receivers which
              will be built and deployed along with two existing receivers in Greenland to
              perform radio tomographic imaging of the E and F region ionosphere.  During the
              experiment, simultaneous measurements of the E region neutral winds will be
              made by the incoherent scatter radar and a Fabry-Perot interferometer at
              Sondrestrom, Greenland.  The local measurements will be put on a global context
              using computer models.  Using this method, the investigators will measure the
              three dimensional spatial and temporal structure in the height-resolved Joule
              heating and determine the contribution of small scale variability in Joule
              heating and its impact on global atmospheric structure. The campaign will test
              and validate the instruments and show that high resolution Joule heating can be
              measured by this technique.  The observations are important to CEDAR/TIMED
              science objectives. CEDAR, which stands for Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics
              of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change program that combines theoretical
              modeling with ground-based measurements to study the upper atmosphere and
              ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and
              Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to study similar regions of the
              atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to coordinate ground-based and
              space-based observations to achieve better understanding of physical processes
              in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.
