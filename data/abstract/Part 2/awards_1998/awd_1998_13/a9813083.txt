Abstract    :
              9813083  Franchek  This research project deals with the development of 
              nonlinear controller design methodology for regulating  sytems and its
              application to the power management of  vehicles.  The nonlinear controllers
              are comprised of  continuous nonlinear differential equations involving power 
              type nonlinearities.  The required nonlinearities and  structure of the
              controller are not preconceived by the  designer but emerge during the
              controller design process.  The execution of the controller design is based on
              the  following key steps: (i) enforcement of the time-domain  tolerances via
              frequency-domain amplitude inequalities,  (ii) development of acceptable design
              regions in the gain-  phase plane, (iii) identification of the nonlinear 
              controller structure as determined by the design regions,  and (iv) design of
              the nonlinear controller using classical  loop shaping tools (tools used by
              practicing engineers) and  quasilinearization techniques (sinusoidal input
              describing  functions).  To experimentally verify the design technology,  the
              power management of hybrid vehicles will be performed.  This not only serves as
              technology transfer, but also  ensures that key implementation issues have been
              fully  addressed.  ***
