Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT      EEC-9813014  Niesz/Rutgers  This is an exploratory research
              project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Ceramics Research.    It is planned to develop a fundamental scientific and
              engineering understanding of fine surface finishing of advanced ceramic
              material using chemically modified polishing environments.   The objective is
              to improve surface finish quality, minimize surface and subsurface damage, and
              increased rate of homogeneous material removal. Special emphasis will be on
              adhesion and abrasion.  Polishing environment variables to be studied include
              polishing solution  pH, electrolyte concentration, and abrasive materials.
              Other controlled  polishing parameters will include temperature and energy
              input. Polishing media will include silica and titania, zirconia and ceria.
