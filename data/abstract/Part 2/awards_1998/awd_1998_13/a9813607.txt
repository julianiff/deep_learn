Abstract    :
              ***  9813607  This award supports a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              to test a new method (Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy) for
              determining deuterium-hydrogen isotope ratios (e.g. D/H)  on polar ice core and
              snow pit samples.   These measurements are traditionally performed with a mass
              spectrometer in the laboratory.  The proposed work is exploratory since such an
              instrument has never been used before as a tool in ice core work and its
              utility for such measurements needs to be established through extensive
              experimentation.  If the results are positive, the benefits of using this
              instrument are that it is small and light weight and could be used in the field
              to obtain a preliminary idea of the seasonal variation in isotope concentration
              and no special sample preparation is necessary.  The objectives of this project
              will be to establish the limits of resolution of the FTIR method, to test for
              seasonal resolution on samples for which nitrate and electrical conductivity
              are already established and to perform a calibration test on core samples which
              have already been measured by mass spectrometry.  If successful, this
              instrument will benefit the upcoming International Trans-Antarctic Scientific
              Expedition (ITASE) traverses which are to begin during the 1999/2000 antarctic
              field season.  ***
