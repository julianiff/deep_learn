Abstract    :
              Shortfalls in building-code enforcement and compliance have been cited
              repeatedly as obstacles in reducing losses of lives and property in natural
              disasters.  The conventional responses call for stronger code enforcement by
              local authorities and for improved building codes.  This proposal extends
              research concerning code enforcement to consider the role of various factors in
              shaping the decisions that residential contractors make about compliance with
              code provisions.  This shifts attention from framing the problem as one of
              increasing enforcement to framing it as one of obtaining compliance.  The
              central policy question is how compliance can be improved in the absence of
              strong enforcement.

The prior research and theorizing about compliance
              decision-making provide bases for generating hypotheses about the role of
              attitudes and values in shaping compliance, as well as hypotheses concerning
              the influence of different enforcement approaches upon contractors' attitudes
              and values about compliance.  These hypotheses will be examined for the
              compliance of contractors involved in residential construction (rehabilitation
              and new) for a sample of cities in Western Washington.  Data collection methods
              will include a survey of contractors and on site observations.
