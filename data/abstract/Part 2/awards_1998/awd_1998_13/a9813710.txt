Abstract    :
              This proposal by two principal investigators describes a three-year research
              plan aimed at developing a general theory of congestion control for high speed
              communication networks, allowing for cooperation as well as noncooperation
              among the users.  The focal point of proposed research is flow control of
              traffic that can adapt to the congestion state of the network by regulation of
              the input transmission rate of packets into the system.   This will involve the
              user of a rich set of tools from decentralized team theory, dynamic game
              theory, and robust identification and estimation.  The framework adopted will
              accommodate many realistic scenarios, such as variable feedback delays, unknown
              feedback delays, bursty sources, and multiple bottleneck nodes to accommodate
              max-min fairness.   

Research efforts along the lines described in the
              proposal should lead to major advances in the methodology and design of
              decentralized flow controllers for high speed networks, as well as to some new
              fundamental results in the theories of decentralized teams and dynamic games. 
              They should also contribute toward making the methodology and the emerging
              design tools accessible to undergraduate and beginning graduate students in an
              engineering curriculum.
