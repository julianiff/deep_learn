This US-Brazil collaborative research award to Dr. David A.
              Naumann, Sevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey will permit a two-year
              study of practical calculus of Object-Oriented Programming with Professor Ana
              Cavalcanti, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil.

This
              research is expected to produce a calculus for development of object-oriented
              programs. The calculus will include laws for program derivation and
              optimization as well as object-oriented class design and class structuring. 
              Given the predominance of object-oriented languages in current industrial
              practice, and the increasing attention being given to rigorous validation of
              system properties like security, the importance of improved development methods
              is critical. This work will help bridge the gaps between recent work in
              programming methods (restricted languages, simple methods, impressive
              applications) and semantics (rich languages even beyond those used today, but
              concentrating on type structures rather than reasoning.)
