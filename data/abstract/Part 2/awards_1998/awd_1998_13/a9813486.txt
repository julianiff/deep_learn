Abstract    :
              Abstract - Gang Chen  9813486      The goal of this workshop and tutorial is to
              provide a cross-disciplinary forum for discussion, education, and presentation
              of the latest results in the rapidly developing area of microscale
              thermophysical engineering.  A one day workshop will be held in conjunction
              with the 7th AIAA/ASME Joint Thermophysics and Heat Transfer Conference.  Four
              tutorial sessions will precede the workshop and will cover the fundamentals of
              microscale heat transfer.  The workshop will include 20-30 invited papers from
              active researchers which will assess the state of the field and identify key
              scientific and engineering needs.
