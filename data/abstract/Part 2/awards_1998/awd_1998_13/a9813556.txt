The investigators  will continue operations and scientific
              studies associated with the Sondrestrom Radar Facility located near
              Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.  The tasks include the management, operation, and
              maintenance of the facility, including all technical aspects of the incoherent
              scatter radar, the Rayleigh lidar, the new resonance lidar, and the all-sky
              imager.  The five-year effort emphasizes the evolutionary development of the
              facility with continuing implementation of modern pulse-coding techniques, data
              acquisition and processing schemes, as well as further advancements in lidar
              performance and upgrades to the existing telescience capability.  Continued
              involvement of scientists is included to provide an environment that promotes
              education, establishes new ideas for facility development, and maintains
              expertise in related sciences conducted at the facility.  Specific tasks
              include (1) operating the radar for 1200 hours per year and the lidars for 300
              hours per year, (2) assisting facility users in carrying out experiments at the
              site, (3) maintaining and upgrading the instrumentation, (4) maintaining high
              quality, easily accessible data products, (5) developing and improving data
              analysis software, (6) collaborating with other scientists, and (7) maintaining
              good relations with the Greenland Home Rule Government and the Danish
              Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland.  Scientific research to be
              conducted include studies of F-region plasma structure, polar cap arcs and
              patches, D- and E-region electron temperature enhancements, high latitude
              electrodynamics, electromagnetic energy coupling to the magnetosphere, auroral
              arc dynamics, geomagnetic storms, ion and neutral layers in the middle
              atmosphere, arctic noctilucent clouds, and atmospheric gravity waves.
