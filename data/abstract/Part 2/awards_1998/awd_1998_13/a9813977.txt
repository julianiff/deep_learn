Abstract    :
              9813977  Kryder    This award will provide funding for the purchase of a
              thin-film physical vapor deposition system to be used to process thin-film
              magnetic recording heads for comnputer memory storage discs.  The equipment
              will be installed in the Data Storage Systems Center Engineering Research
              Center at the Carnegie Mellon University in a class 100 clean room.  It will
              enhance the research capabilities of the Center and the ongoing collabortion
              between the researchers at the center and the magnetic recording industrial
              community.  The Center has twenty one industrial partners with whom to
              collaborate.  The equipment will be used to process thin films of iron nitride
              alloys, synthetic antiferromagnets, abutted permanent magnets, as well as giant
              magnetoresistive materials.  These materials will be integrated with
              semiconductor materials in some cases to produce microelectromechanical
              actuator systems for magnetic read and write heads.    In addition funding is
              provided for the support of a Technical School Internship Program to be
              conducted at the Center during 1998/9.
