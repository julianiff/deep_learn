Abstract    :
              DMI-9813213  Dawson  High-speed manufacture and transport of thin webs require
              tight control of the large vibration that can result from material
              non-uniformity, support roller motion/eccentricity, or aerodynamic excitation.
              Since failure of the web (i.e., web breaks) due to excessive vibration wastes
              material and time, the use of active vibration control for eliminating
              vibration-induced web breaks is well motivated.  The primary objectives of this
              research are to: i) develop the mathematical framework for designing
              high-performance controllers and the associated mechanical actuators for web
              handling systems, ii) develop new web handling control systems for axial-moving
              materials that require large amplitude vibration reduction and/or require
              accurate axial-speed tracking for aggressive desired speed profiles, and iii)
              move the application of actively controlled web handling systems to more
              widespread use by experimentally verifying the theoretical results with
              real-time implementation.   The research is expected to impact control theory
              (e.g., implementable performance improving distributed model controllers),
              material transport technology (e.g., next-generation high speed machinery), and
              other crosscutting areas (e.g., cable system, flexible robot manipulators,
              etc.). It has the potential of creating entirely new control system paradigms
              for the vibration control of axially-moving web-like materials.
