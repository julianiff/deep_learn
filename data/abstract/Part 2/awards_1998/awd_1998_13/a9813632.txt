Abstract    :
              This award will support a conference at Pomona College on  April 25, 1998.  This
              conference will focus on two themes:  "Is computing bringing teaching and
              research closer together  in the life sciences?" and "What infrastructure needs
              are  arising from the increased use of computing in the life  sciences?"  In
              the morning, a series of twenty minute talks  on the first topic will be
              followed by a general discussion.  A break featuring a box lunch will provide
              opportunities for  informal interactions by the participants.  In the 
              afternoon, a series of twenty minute talks relating to the  second theme will
              be presented, followed by a general  discussion of the second theme.  Dinner
              will feature a talk  by a prominent educator/researcher in life sciences who
              uses  computing.  All interested faculty from educational  institutions in the
              Los Angeles area will be invited, via  flyers and letters to the department
              chair in biology.  Institutions invited will include the Claremont Colleges 
              (Pomona, Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna, Pitzer, Scripps),  Occidental College,
              Whittier College, University of  Redlands, UCLA, USC, UCR, UCI, CSU San
              Bernardino, CSU  Northridge, CSULA, Pasadena City College, and others.
