Abstract    :
              The purpose of this Small Grants Exploratory Research (SGER)  project is to
              determine the feasibility of combining tools from  (discrete) computational
              geometry and (continuous) analytic  computations using theory of R-functions. 
              Specific tasks to be  accomplished during this exploratory study are:    1.
              development and implementation of algorithms for automatic  construction of
              (implicit) real-valued functions for objects  represented by Boolean and/or
              boundary representations;    2. conduct experiments to verify computational and
              numerical  properties of constructed functions predicted by the theory.    The
              results of these explorations will be used to define and  undertake a
              significantly larger scale effort to develop a  computational environment for
              modeling and solving engineering  and scientific problems.  The unique feature
              of such an  environment will be seamless integration of geometric and  analytic
              computations.
