Abstract    :
              9813850  Ortiz  The symposium brings together prominent members of the 
              community with expertise in computational mechanics to  review the current
              needs, trends, and opportunities  pertaining to the testing and verification of
              large-scale  advanced simulation codes. Recommendations are made on  testing
              techniques, algorithm analysis, benchmark problems  and other useful avenues
              for assessing the fidelity and  performance of computational mechanics codes.
