Abstract    :
              This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, funds an initial
              exploration of algorithmic and control issues for massively parallel
              manipulation of nanometer-scale structures.  Manipulation of such objects with
              the tip of a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) is an emerging and very promising
              technique for constructing nanodevices by robotic assembly.  However, SPM-based
              nanoassembly has a low throughput, which is a major drawback for large-scale
              manufacturing.  Parallel operation with arrays of probe tips can provide a
              solution to the throughput problem.  Array hardware is being developed at
              several laboratories, but software for programming them is unavailable.  This
              SGER research will seek strategies and algorithms for programming massively
              parallel SPM tip arrays to execute nanomanipulation tasks, such as writing data
              on the nanoscale equivalent of a compact disk by arranging nanoparticles on a
              surface.  Many of these tasks require collaboration between tips and raise
              challenging problems, which will be explored.  An important goal is to reduce
              the complexity of the hardware necessary to accomplish the tasks.
