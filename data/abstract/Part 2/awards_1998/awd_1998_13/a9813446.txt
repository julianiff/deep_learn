Abstract    :
              The NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) continues its work to be
              the leader in determining the needs of information technology (IT) employers
              and students.  Partnerships with leadership organizations representing
              corporations, professional societies, and educational institutions provide
              direction development and implementation of IT skill standards, IT curricula,
              instructional materials, and professional development of faculty.  The Center
              is establishing articulation agreements with four year colleges and with high
              schools and Tech Prep consortia to ensure seamless transitions for students. 
              The four major goals of the Center are to advance model partnerships linking
              business, education and government to promote IT education, to provide student
              pathways to new IT programs and new Advanced Technology degrees, to develop,
              test and disseminate IT curricula, curriculum products and teaching and
              learning resources, and to contribute to national leadership through
              dissemination of "best practices" in IT education.  The Center has established
              working relationships with the Gartner Group, Harcourt Brace, and Educational
              Development Center to disseminate materials and professional development
              workshops.  The American Electronics Association is validating the Skill
              Standards.
