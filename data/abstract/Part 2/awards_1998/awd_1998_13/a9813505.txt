Abstract    :
              Charles Knobler is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Americas
              Program in the Division of International Programs to hold a US-Mexico
              scientific meeting entitled: "2nd International Workshop on Current Problems in
              Complex Fluids: Thin Interfacial Films."  The workshop will be held in Oaxaca,
              Mexico, on January 3-9, 1999, and has been jointly organized with Prof. Jaime
              Ruiz Garcia of the Institute of Physics of the University of San Luis de
              Potosi.  The aim of the meeting is to discuss current developments in the field
              of thin organic films and related problems and to provide an environment for
              the establishment of joint research initiatives between Mexican and American
              scientific communities working in the field.  The meeting will be sponsored
              jointly by NSF and CONACyT with additional support from the University of
              Mexico and the University of San Luis Potosi.

The properties of complex
              fluid systems are employed to advantage in many areas of technology.  They play
              important roles in many industries such as pharmaceutical, microelectronics,
              food, polymers, paints, and cosmetics. Their study is associated with the
              development of new technologies and materials including microreactors, model
              membranes, biological and chemical sensors, and biomolecular materials.  There
              is active research in complex fluids in both the United States and Mexico, and
              informal interactions exist between the two scientific communities.  This
              workshop will provide additional opportunities for establishing joint
              international research programs and to initiate contacts with prospective
              students and postdoctorals.
