Contingent herbivore regulation of ecosystem
              processes

This research will study the way that large herbivores, ungulates,
              can interact with the physical environment, particularly soils, to create
              environments that can be nutritionally advantageous to themselves.  Humans are
              an integral component of the research plan since it is proposed that
              pastoralist cattle herders in Africa, by penning livestock inside villages at
              night to avoid predators, cause a large injection of nutrients into a local
              area.  The investigators propose that after the village moves these enriched
              areas become favored foraging areas for native herbivores, which both maintain
              them and expand their area.  Dr. McNaughton will compare the fate of abandoned
              village plots on soils that are inherently nutrient-poor with others that are
              nutrient-rich.  In addition, mineralization rates will be assayed on plots at
              various ages from abandonment.  This research will provide insight into how
              humans in Africa interact with the ecosystems they inhabit.
