The investigators will continue studies on the generation
              mechanisms of small scale size irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere. 
                The focus of the research is to further develop and augment a numerical
              three-dimensional model of one of the main structuring mechanisms in the
              region, namely, the EXB instability.  The methods to be employed will be
              numerical three dimensional models applied to the high latitude ionosphere by
              inclusion of inertial effects.  Early results from the model show that without
              inertial effects the small scale structures can grow on slow time scales due to
              the stabilizing influence of parallel electron dynamics.  Thus, plasma
              structure in the high latitude regions can be maintained for hours.  However,
              observations indicate this may not be the case.  Also, the simulations indicate
              that the spectra of density irregularities show strong asymmetry in the two
              directions transverse to the direction of the magnetic field.  This is also not
              observed.  To address these discrepancies, the investigators will introduce
              inertial effects to make the linear and nonlinear polarization drifts more
              significant.  The new model with inertial will unify many observed features. 
              These results will be compared with observations and new experiments will be
              suggested to test the theoretical results
