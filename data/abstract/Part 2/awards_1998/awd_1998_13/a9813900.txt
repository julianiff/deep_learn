Abstract    :
                  ECS-9813900  Edward Labuda    This is a proposal requesting support for
              student travel for 1998 IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical Meetings-Optical MEMS to be
              held in Monterey, CA, July 20-22, 1998.    This meeting will provide a forum
              for the academia and industry developers in the Optical
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (OMEMS) for exchange of latest technical
              information and applications.  Emphasis will be placed on enhancing optics and
              optical systems capabilities by applying MEMS technology.  Topics of interest
              include design, fabrication, materials, modeling, operation, packaging and
              commercialization of the OMEMS on the micron scale.  Optical MEM is an emerging
              technology that promises to have a wide impact in communications, imaging,
              displays, remote sensing, optical assembly, and signal processing.
