The PIs propose to carry out theoretical calculations and
              corresponding computer simulations of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a
              dielectric coated groundplane.  Initially the PIs will use the method of
              moments and then compare the results with those obtained from the finite
              element method.  Theoretical efforts will involve finding a class of Green's
              functions and algorithms to calculate them.  These will be implemented in 
              computer codes to carry out simulations.
