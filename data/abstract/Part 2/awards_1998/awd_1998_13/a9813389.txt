This award provides travel support for twelve American
              participants to travel to Sydney, Australia where the will take part in the
              United States-Australia-New Zealand Workshop on the Immunology of Marsupials. 
              The American Principal Organizer is Prof. Robert Miller of the Department of 
              Biology, University of  New Mexico.  The counterpart Principal Organizers are
              Prof. D. Cooper of Macquarie University, in Sydney, Prof. Elizabeth Deane of
              the University of Western Sydney, and Dr. Bryce Buddle of the New Zealand
              Pastoral Agricultural Research Institute. The American team includes 5 faculty,
              two graduate students, and five undergraduates.  All American participants,
              including graduate and undergraduate students, will present papers on their
              research.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the world's leading
              authorities on marsupial immunobiology to summarize the state of the art.  The
              last time this was attempted was in 1986 at the Australian Academy of
              Sciences.
