This US-Argentine collaborative research proposal between
              Dr. Manuel Soriaga, Texas A&M University and Dr. Walter E. Triaca, Instituto de
              Investigaciones Fisicoquimicas Teoricas y Aplicadas (INIFTA), La Plata,
              Argentina, is a two-year proposal to conduct collaborative research on hydride
              alloy electrodes for nickel-metal hydride batteries. 

The U.S. team will
              bring their expertise in electrochemical surface science, including the
              elucidation of electrochemical reactions, while the Argentinean team will focus
              on the material science aspects of the collaboration to explore the synthesis
              and evaluation of novel alloy electrodes.  This joint effort between two highly
              respected groups may lead to better performing electrodes for nickel-metal
              hydride batteries and improved understanding of fundamental processes at the
              electrode-solution interface.
