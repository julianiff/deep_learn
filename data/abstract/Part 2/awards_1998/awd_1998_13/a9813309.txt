Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT 
EEC-9813309
Somasundaran/Columbia 

This is an Exploratory
              Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              
for Surfactants.

The dynamics of the formation of surfactant and polymer
              layers at solid-liquid interfaces using advanced spectroscopic techniques will
              be investigated.  The research will utilize  near-field scanning optical
              microscopy, lifetime chemical imaging, 2-photon fluorescence spectroscopy with
              fluorescence, ESR, electrokinetic, wettability and microcalorimetric
              techniques. This should lead to optimization of industrial processes and
              commercial formulations involving surface-active agents.
