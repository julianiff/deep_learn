This U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Research award is for
              a project on "Sex pheromone biosynthesis in moths." The principal investigators
              are Dr. Russell Jurenka of Iowa State University and Dr. Mitko Subahev of the
              Institute of Zoology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Pheromones are
              compounds released by one individual to affect the behavior of another
              individual. Female moths use sex pheromones for the long-range attraction of
              Nonspecific males. These sex pheromones are species-specific blends of
              chemicals biosynthesized and released by female moths. While pheromone
              identification, production, and reception in moths is well-studied, basic
              questions remain on how this communication system has evolved and how these
              chemicals are biosynthesized. The researchers propose to identify how the
              female moths (Herald moth, Scoliopteryx libatrix, and Gypsy moth, Lymantria
              dispar) make a hydrocarbon pheromone component. While several groups of moths
              use hydrocarbons exclusively as sex pheromones, the biosynthesis of moths that
              are targets of this research have unique methyl branched and unsaturated
              pheromone components and their biosynthesis has not be identified in any
              insect. As a result of the proposed collaboration, the researchers will be
              identifying unique biosynthetic pathways for the production of these sex
              pheromone components.

This research in entomology fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
