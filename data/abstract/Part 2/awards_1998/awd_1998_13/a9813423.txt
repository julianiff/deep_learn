This three-year award in support of U.S.-Spain collaborative
              research in molecular simulations of nanomembranes involves Sohail Murad at the
              University of Illinois at Chicago, and Eduardo Enciso at the Universidad
              Complutense de Madrid.  They will use computer simulations to study reverse
              osmosis in gaseous and liquid solutions.  The goal of the research will lead to
              a better understanding of reverse osmosis at the molecular level, that will
              ultimately aid in the design of more efficient nanomembranes.  

The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the methodology of
              molecular dynamics of fluids confined by semi-permeable membranes.  This is
              complemented by the Spanish experience in the transition from the hydrodynamic
              regime to the microscopic regime.  The project will be cooperative in that
              simulation and theory will be carried out at both laboratories, and their
              independent molecular dynamics studies will be reviewed jointly to determine
              the need for further simulations and new areas for development.
