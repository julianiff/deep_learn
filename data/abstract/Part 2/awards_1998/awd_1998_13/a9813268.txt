This grant is supported by the Materials Theory Program in
              the Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics Activity in the
              Physics Division and the Applied Mathematics Program in the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences.  This award supports education and a broad research
              program in statistical mechanics with the aim of a better understanding of
              macroscopic phenomena, such as phase transitions in equilibrium and
              nonequilibrium systems, originating in the cooperative behavior of the
              microscopic constituents of matter. Specific topics for investigation include:
              extending recent work with the aim of developing a continuum theory of phase
              transitions such as boiling and melting; the problem of the kinetics of phase
              segregation of continuum fluids and alloys that occurs following the sudden
              cooling from a uniform high temperature phase into a coexistence region, with a
              particular focus on elastic alloys subjected to external stresses; the
              properties of stationary nonequilibrium states of macroscopic systems, such as
              those carrying steady state currents; and the quantum description of
              macroscopic systems which includes fluctuations and large deviations in
              equilibrium and irreversible behavior in nonequilibrium systems.

              Research will be done on a number of problems in statistical mechanics which
              will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the large-scale
              behavior of matter, e.g., fluids, and its underlying particulate nature, e.g.,
              molecules. This research is fundamental, but strategic issues associated with
              many problems of practical interest are addressed.
