OPP-9813029

Estimates have been made that the relatively small,
              temperate Iceland ice caps could respond to sensitive changes in climate that
              could occur in ten to one-hundred years.  Refining an understanding of this
              high level of sensitivity requires very accurate estimates of glacial mass
              balance and changes in this balance over time. The small the Hofsjokull and
              Langjokull ice caps are ideal for high-resolution studies of ice mass using new
              numerical tools for three-dimensional ice flow modeling.  The recently
              developed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements of the
              surface topography and velocity fields of glaciers have the potential to vastly
              improve our understanding of glacial and ice cap dynamics.  InSAR's power lies
              in the combination of high spatial resolution over large geographic areas and
              its ability to observe the most remote areas on earth.
