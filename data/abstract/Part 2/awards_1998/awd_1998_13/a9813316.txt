This proposal is on research to continue to develop a
              quantitative thermodynamic basic for the analysis and design of protein
              separations, comparable to that which is routinely applied to conventional
              separations in the chemical process industries.  This will involve research on:
               (1) molecular theories to predict key thermodynamic properties of proteins in
              solution, based on protein structure, when it is known, and on key experimental
              biophysical characteristics, when the structure is not known, and (2) use of
              the descriptions of phase behavior and physical properties to develop rational,
              thermodynamically-based approaches to predict separation performance for
              important processes, including precipitation and two-phase aqueous
              extraction.
