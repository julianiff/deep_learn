This award provides partial support for publications that will
              result from a "Workshop on  New Engineering Technology Transfer in
              Orthopaedics" to be held April 30, 1998 through May 3, 1998. Participants in
              the workshop will discuss the emerging technologies of digital image graphics,
              robotics, and computer informatics which have already made significant impacts
              on medicine and surgery in research, education and patient care. The
              participants include young scientists and other investigators with strong
              interest and expertise in related technologies and in other disciplines both
              from the USA and abroad.

The workshop provides a forum for the review of the
              relative merits and potential negative effects of the impact of these
              technologies. A candid review of the problems, needs and possibilities of these
              new tools in different sub-specialties of the field is appropriate and
              necessary to assess properly the potential value of this technology in
              orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation medicine.  For Medical Robots, Virtual
              Reality Models, Telemedicine/Telesurgery, Computer-Assisted Surgery and
              Preoperative Planning to play an important role in the future of orthopaedic
              medicine, their proper scope and relevant areas of application must be
              carefully defined and scrutinized.

Detailed plans have been prepared for the
              publication of workshop findings.  Publications, making use of extensive color
              graphics, are to be a paperback book, CD-ROM, and an Internet Web site.
