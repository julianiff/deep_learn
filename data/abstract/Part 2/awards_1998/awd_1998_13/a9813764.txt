This award supports research and education in the area of strong
              correlations and disorder. Three problems will be considered: (1) The
              metal-to-insulator transition in two dimensions.  A focus of research in this
              area is to take into account the role of strong interactions and disorder, and
              to ascertain the role of local moment formation in the metallic state near the
              transition.  (2) The effect of non-magnetic impurities in spin 1/2
              antiferromagnets for which quantum fluctuations are important. Of particular
              inspiration is the theoretical and experimental observation of a surprising
              purely quantum mechanical effect: long-range order induced by introducing
              impurities in ladder compounds.  The PI inquires whether related phenomena
              occur in the two-dimensional spin 1/2  Heisenberg model, and plans to study the
              effect of disorder and of an external magnetic field. (3) The PI proposes to
              continue work on the effect of disorder in d-wave superconductors.

This
              award supports research on phenomena and ordered states (e.g.
              superconductivity) involving electrons that interact strongly with each other
              in materials that show significant random deviations from perfect crystalline
              order.  The understanding of these phenomena are of fundamental importance and
              bears on a wide class of materials of potential importance to future device
              technologies that includes electrons trapped at interfaces between
              semiconductors, and high temperature superconductors and their relatives. This
              research activity provides for continued education of advanced students and
              post-graduates in state-of-the-art methods and concepts in the theory of solid
              state materials.
