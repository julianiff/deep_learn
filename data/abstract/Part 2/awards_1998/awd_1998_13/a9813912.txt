This proposal requests funding for a collaborative research
              project between Dr. Johan Varekamp, Wesleyan University, Connecticut, and Drs.
              Daniel H. Delpino, Director of Science and Technology of Neuquen Province,
              COPADE. Neuquen Argentina, and Dr. Adriana Bermudez, CONICET. .  They will
              conduct a study of the hydrogeochemistry of the Copahue Volcano, located in the
              eastern Andes.  The volcano has an extensive acid hydrothermal system with a
              crater lake, acid springs that draw fluids from deep sources, and a geothermal
              system on its NE flank.  The hydrothermal fluids acidify a large river, the Rio
              Agrio, and the glacial lake, Caviahue. The main goals of the research  include
              the description of the chemical composition of the fluids from the volcano, 
              water/rock interaction processes in the crater lake and in the acidified
              watershed, a quantification of the element fluxes through the Rio Agrio, and an
              evaluation of volcanic hazards around Copahue.  The researchers also plan to
              create a theoretical model for lake explosions to investigate the nature of
              eruption triggers.
 
The nature of  volcano-magmatic hydrothermal systems and
              the interactions of these deep fluids with meteoric waters is an important
              field of study for ore deposition, and the acid effluent of these systems may
              have a severe impact on local watershed. Comprehensive major and trace element
              and isotopic analyses of the crater lake and acid springs will provide the
              rates of magmatic degassing and rock dissolution in the hydrothermal system, as
              well as the isotopic character of the deep hydrothermal fluids. 

The 
              results of the study, which is expected to yield very practical data of
              environmental, as well as volcanological significance, will be displayed at the
              Neuquen Museum of Geology.
