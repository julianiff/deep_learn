Abstract    :
              Under an SGER award the PI has recently demonstrated the feasibility of
              synthesizing carbon coatings on silcon carbide surfaces by removing the silicon
              with a halogen etch in a high temperature reactor. This project will study the
              fundamental nature of the process to determine the mechanisms of carbon-carbon
              self assembly, the various structures grown as a functioon of process
              conditions, and the thermodynamics of formation and the kinetics of growth. The
              conditions for formation of diamond, diamond-like, amorphous carbon, and
              graphite layers will be determined. Some of the chemical, mechanical and
              tribological properties of the films will be evaluated as well as their
              suitability as interface layers for CVD deposition of carbon films.
