The investigators will continue using a Fabry-Perot
              interferometer for systematic studies of variability of faint exospheric
              hydrogen Balmer-alpha emission intensity due to solar and other natural
              influences.  The instrument is called WHAM for Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper, and is
              located at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Tucson, Arizona. The sun plays a major
              role in defining the base properties of the upper atmosphere.  Its influence
              through heating and photochemistry must be understood to accurately
              characterize the upper atmosphere and to separate natural from possible
              anthropogenic signatures in this region.  The observations made with WHAM will
              lead to improved understanding of natural variability in upper and middle
              atmospheric hydrogenous species, thereby facilitating more detailed predictions
              for their response to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases.
