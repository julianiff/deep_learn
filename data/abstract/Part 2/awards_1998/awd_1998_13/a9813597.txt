Abstract    :
              The existing Industrial Research Institute/Center for Innovation Management
              Studies (IRI/CIMS) Annual R&D Survey, which supports research on management of
              technological innovation, will continue to be performed.  The survey instrument
              will be augmented so that data can be collected on variables that are uniquely
              relevant to firms and business units operating in dynamic and technology
              intensive business sectors such as software, defense/aerospace, and
              telecommunications.  Coverage will be increased to seek answers to important
              questions about the contribution of R&D to innovation outcomes, such as product
              and process cost reductions and revenue enhancements.  Finally, the breadth of
              the Annual Survey sample will be expanded to include firms that may not be
              members of the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), but whose R&D activities
              are of significant economic interest and importance.  In addition, the
              Management Practices Survey (MPS), which was last conducted in 1996, will be
              repeated.  The MPS contributes greatly to the database by providing information
              about changes in the structure of R&D organizations and laboratories that occur
              over time, shifts in the business goals supported by R&D, and changes in R&D
              program planning and project selection emphasis.  Such information has
              strengthened researchers' ability to interpret trends that have appeared in the
              Annual Survey data.
