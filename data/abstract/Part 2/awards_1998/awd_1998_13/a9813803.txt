The aim of this project is to gain greater understanding through
              fundamental studies of the effects of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic stress
              states on self and impurity diffusion, and on crystal growth in silicon. A
              critical test of the investigator's theory for his recently-discovered
              kinetically-driven growth instability in stressed solids will be performed
              using solid phase epitaxy as a model system. The effects of simple stress
              states, such as hydrostatic and biaxial stresses, on atomic diffusion
              perpendicular to the surface and parallel to the surface will be measured and
              compared to each other using newly developed non-hydrostatic thermodynamic
              theory. The conceptual framework and key parameter values emerging from this
              research are expected to aid in the determination of predominant atomistic
              diffusion mechanisms; to provide benchmark parameter values for comparison with
              ab initio theory; and permit the prediction of arbitrary stress states on
              atomic diffusion in arbitrary directions. The conceptual framework emerging
              from this research is expected to impact semiconductor device fabrication and
              current research in strained-layer heteroepitaxial growth.

The project
              addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having
              high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of
              electronic/photonic devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from
              the research is expected to contribute new knowledge to improving the
              performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by providing
              increased fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
              improved materials, and processing technologies.  An important feature of the
              program is the integration of research and education through the training of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
