Abstract    :
              This award, in the SGER mode, funds an initial exploration and prototyping of
              personal devices, controlled by physiological signals, for the purpose of
              augmenting human function.  The objective is to provide children who have
              severe motor disabilities, a device that can navigate and manipulate the
              external environment under their control.  The impact of such a device will be
              to provide an exploratory agent that would allow the child to tele-interact,
              thereby unlocking his/her cognitive abilities, promoting curiosity and a sense
              of entitlement to explore, and allowing personal development to continue. 
              Three primary hypotheses will be addressed: (1) a remote "personal robotic
              device" under the control of a child with a severe disability can promote
              cognitive and motor development; (2) the interface can be optimized by using
              subtle physiological signals to control the device and multisensory feedback;
              and (3) the actions of the device, which is intimately connected to the user,
              can be used as a new technique to evaluate children whose capabilities have not
              yet been elucidated.
