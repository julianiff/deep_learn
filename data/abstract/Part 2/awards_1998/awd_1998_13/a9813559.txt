Abstract    :
                9813559  Bronzino  The Biomedical Engineering Alliance for Connecticut
              (BEACON)  is presenting a Biosensor Symposium on October 2, 1998 at  Trinity
              College, Hartford, Connecticut.  Biosensors detect  signals representing
              biological variables and convert them  to electrical signals; they serve as the
              interface between a  biologic system and an electronic system.  The several 
              objectives of the meeting are to provide insights into  ongoing research for
              the development of biosensors, to  describe examples of industrial successes in
              transforming  ideas into successful products, and to present information  about
              funding opportunities for collaborative  academic/industrial efforts. The
              symposium is well organized  and the speakers are leaders in the development of
               biosensors.    This meeting is one of two seminars usually convened by  BEACON
              each academic semester to review highlights of  biomedical engineering
              research. BEACON is a joint project  of four educational
              institutions-University of Connecticut  at Storrs, the University of
              Connecticut Health Center, the  University of Hartford, and Trinity College. 
              The symposium  presentations are to be made by a group of eminent  researchers
              and the meeting is expected to elicit interest  from a national audience.  From
              175-200 persons including 20- 30 students from BEACON affiliated institutions
              are expected  to attend.  Dissemination of results of the meeting will  occur
              in a printed publication for which funds are being  awarded by the Foundation. 
                Attendees at the meeting will learn about current  applications of
              state-of-the-art biosensors and gain an  insight to their future capabilities
              as this technological  area develops.  ***
