Abstract    :
              The United States has defined itself as a `middle class` society, in contrast to
              much of the world where the majority of the population can in no way be
              characterized as middle class.  Yet while some anthropologists have studied
              middle class working families, little attention has been focused on this
              subject as a core research topic for the discipline. The contributions to our
              understanding of how these families confront the challenges of contemporary
              life that derive from the in-depth, intensive, long-term ethnographic data that
              anthropology provides have not been explicitly examined.  This project involves
              a conference of twelve anthropological researchers organized and administered
              by the American Anthropological Association, the major professional association
              for anthropologists in the US.  The conference will occur on May 31-June 2,
              with an agenda to determine anthropology's current and future contributions to
              the academic research topic of middle class working families; publication in AY
              1999 of commentaries by anthropologists on research issues involving middle
              class working families in the Anthropology Newsletter, the American
              Anthropological Association's main vehicle for communication among members; and
              the publication and dissemination of a research agenda to anthropologists to
              encourage research on the broad topic of middle class working families.  The
              conference is supported by NSF funds, the other activities are supported by a
              grant from the Sloan foundation. This project is important because by defining
              areas of potential contributions, the conference and publications will
              stimulate new research.
