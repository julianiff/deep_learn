Math is Everywhere - Public Understanding
              and Engagement Mathematics Initiative


	This project is a funded as a
              component of the joint NSF/DoE Public Understanding and Engagement Initiative
              for middle grade mathematics.  NCTM, Widmeyer-Baker and NACME are partnering to
              launch and deliver the Initiative.  NCTM has responsibility for ensuring that
              the mathematics conveyed throughout the Initiative is compelling, accurate, and
              appropriate for middle grade learners.  Their project contributions are
              entitled Math in the Media and the Public as Partners.  Math in the Media is
              the title of the Problem of the Week feature, which will be designed for weekly
              promotions around the country.  The problems will be developed across the
              following content strands: number, data, geometry, measurement, and patterns,
              functions and algebra.  Problem contexts will vary.  The problems of the week
              will be designed such that they will be simultaneously available in print and
              web-based formats.  The Public as Partners project component will be aimed at
              the general public and will develop printed materials to support and engage the
              public in actually doing mathematics.
