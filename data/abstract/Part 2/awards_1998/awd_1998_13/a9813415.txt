This one-year award will support a planning visit to develop
              a collaboration between researchers in three countries on surface/subsurface
              exchange processes in meandering streams.  The PI will visit the unique
              meandering channel facility at the H.R. Wallingford Hydraulics Laboratory to
              observe the experiments conducted by the two European investigators, Ian Guymer
              of Sheffield University in the United Kingdom, and Andrea Marion of the
              University of Padua in Italy.   The objective of the visit will be the
              initiation of a collaboration that takes advantage of the European and US
              expertise in lateral mixing and dispersion in three-dimensional,
              naturally-formed channels and bedform-driven colloid exchange between streams
              and stream beds and additional stream/subsurface exchange processes and their
              impact on contaminant transport.
