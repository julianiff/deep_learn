This cooperative research award supports Carol Arnosti and a
              graduate student from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to
              collaborate with B.B. Jorgensen of the Department of Biogeochemistry at the Max
              Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany.  The focus of the
              research is the complex community of bacteria responsible for transforming
              macromolecular organic matter, ultimately reducing it to CO2.  The
              collaboration allows a unique blend of complementary expertise, since the U.S.
              side has experience in the study of the initial steps of organic matter
              remineralization and the German group has experience studying the final stages.
               The rates and pathways of carbon remineralization in marine sediments
              profoundly affect carbon cycling on local as well as global scales.  The
              composition and dynamics of the diverse group of microbes responsible for
              remineralization of organic carbon, however, are largely unknown, and the
              rate-controlling steps in the remineralization process only poorly understood. 
              By focusing on the links between the initial and terminal steps in
              remineralization, the collaborative project should lead to greater insight into
              these key steps of the carbon cycle.
