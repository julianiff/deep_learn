Abstract    :
              This project supports a strategic alliance between NSF and Lehigh University
              that will increase academic and industrial participation in small scale,
              interdisciplinary research projects on the management of technological
              innovations (MOTI).  The Center for Innovation Management Studies (CIMS) at
              Lehigh University operates an industry-university cooperative research program
              that provides small grants for academic research on MOTI at universities
              throughout the country.  Annual fees paid by its industrial sponsors fund CIMS,
              which was founded in 1984.  The strategic alliance between the National Science
              Foundation and CIMS will enhance the quality of research by seeding worthy
              projects in the management of technology.
