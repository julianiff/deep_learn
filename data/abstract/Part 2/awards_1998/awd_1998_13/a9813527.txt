The investigator will use data from an upward looking sonar to
              determine the thickness of the ice when a US Navy submarine passes beneath the
              Arctic Ocean ice pack in summer 1999 as part of the joint National Science
              Foundation and Office of Naval Research SCICEX program.  Data from the 1999
              cruise will be used in conjunction with previously classified data from cruises
              for the past ten years to investigate the possibility that the thickness of the
              ice pack has been thinning due to global warming.  This project is a very
              important contribution to global change studies because thinning of the Arctic
              ice pack could be one of the first indications of global warming.  The upward
              looking sonar data from submarines is the only way to examine retrospectively
              the ice thickness to determine if global warming is affecting the Arctic Ocean.
              The results of this study will answer a very important question in global
              change research.
