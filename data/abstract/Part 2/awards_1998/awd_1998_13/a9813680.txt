A Coupled
              Modeling Study of Interdecadal-Decadal Climate Variability in the Pacific Ocean
              Region

This study proposes to examine the decadal to interdecadal climate
              variability in the Pacific region  using the NCAR CSM as the primary tool. The
              ability of the ocean model to simulate subduction will be examined.  Uncoupled
              sensitivity experiments where the AGCM is forced by prescribed SST anomalies
              and the OGCM is forced by prescribed AGCM anomalies, as well as coupled
              ocean/atmosphere experiments  will be conducted  to study  mechanisms for
              producing and maintaining low frequency variability. The work is important
              because it will enhance our understanding of the air-sea coupling in the
              Pacific region.
