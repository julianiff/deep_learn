Abstract    :
              ATM9813704

The investigators will automate the existing E-region Fabry-Perot
              interferometer (FPI) at Millstone Hill Observatory to enable more regular
              observation of D and E region winds and temperatures using emissions from
              hydroxyl and atomic oxygen.  The upgrade will include a new plate cage to
              improve the stability of the instrument, a motor driven pointing head, and
              upgraded acquisition software to enable unattended data taking. Currently the
              FPI at Millstone Hill is operated manually, which limits operations because of
              a shortage of staff.  Automation will enable the instrument to be operated on a
              regular basis, limited only by seeing conditions.  The D and E region wind
              measurements will  support CEDAR/TIMED science goals.  CEDAR, which stands for
              Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change
              program that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to
              study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere,
              Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to
              study similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to
              coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better
              understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.
