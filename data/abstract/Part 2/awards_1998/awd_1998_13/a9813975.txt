Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of a variant of the  Kulinkovich
              cyclopropanation reaction to afford hetero-substituted cyclopropanes.  The
              substituted cyclopropanes will serve as synthetic intermediates for the
              production of several classes of organic compounds.  Among the target molecules
              are medium sized carbocycles, triquinanes and functionalized alkaloids.

With
              this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at the University
              of Alabama.  Professor Cha will focus his work on developing synthetic
              methodology which relies on the inherent reactivity of three membered rings. 
              The methodology will be used to synthesize interesting natural products.
