This proposal would support the
              continuation of a series of workshops that bring together recently graduated
              Ph.D.'s throughout the marine and freshwater sciences.  This educational and
              human-resource program will facilitate communication and the development of
              interactive research projects within the aquatic sciences.  Three earlier
              versions of these DIALOG (Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of
              Limnology and Oceanography) workshops have been very successful at fostering
              interactions among a new cohort of researchers in aquatic sciences.  The
              planned workshops have participants with a wide diversity of backgrounds and
              include substantial international participation.  They will foster widely
              ranging, interdisciplinary collaborations and ultimately foster new directions
              within the aquatic disciplines.
