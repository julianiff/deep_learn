Abstract    :
              9813447  Walker  The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of
              planetary differentiation by igneous processes.  Methods of study include:  (1)
              melting, element partitioning, and /or decomposition studies of planetary
              materials and related synthethic compositions using experimental petrology; (2)
              petrographic and microprobe studies of experimental products and natural
              samples as well as theoretical and numerical modeling of magmatic systems; (3)
              technique development for studies of high temperature and pressure phase
              equilibria, element partitioning and materials behavior.  The following
              projects will be undertaken:  (a) exploration of the P, T, and liquid
              compositional dependence of the partitioning of very highly siderophile
              elements between melt and silicate liquids; (b) study of the volume of the
              garnet solution series at simultaneously high P and T by synchrotron XRD; (c)
              determination of high P, T, volumes of selected fluid substances by tracking
              relevant crystal decomposition curves using sychrotron XRD; (d) improvement of
              the doping properties, reliability, and X-ray transparency of semiconductor
              heaters based on Al carbide and nitride composites; (e) completion of the data
              reduction of epithermal neutron resonance pyrometry measurements of the effect
              of P on thermocouple emf.
