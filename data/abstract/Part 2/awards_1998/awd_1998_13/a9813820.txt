Abstract    :
              9813820  Engineering of systems with computerized components is an  important
              research area for better quality systems as well  as speeding up the
              construction process. Building quality  computer systems that can meet user
              needs effectively and  reliably is currently a major problem. Formal methods
              that  can be partially or completely automated provide a promising  approach to
              this problem. A three-day workshop on this subject  is  proposed,  to  take 
              place in Carmel.  The  purposes  of  the  workshop are to identify criteria for
              determining potential  practical impact of automatable methods for engineering 
              of  computer based systems, to assess current research efforts in  this  area,
              to identify results and directions that can  increase  the  degree of
              automation, to aid tool integration by building  a  common understanding, and
              to increase the practical use of formal  methods via automation.***
