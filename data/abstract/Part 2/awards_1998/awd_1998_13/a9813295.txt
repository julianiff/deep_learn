Abstract    :
              The unique properties of nano- and mesoscale materials will be utilized to
              create novel smart materials for chemical sensing and for molecular separation
              processes.  The work will be accomplished through a collaboration that involves
              a materials science group, a synthetic chemistry group, a bioorganic group, and
              a theory group, which will together conceptualize, synthesize, and utilize
              novel optical materials to solve problems in analytical chemistry, biology,
              clinical medicine, and environmental science.  This project will develop new
              methods in materials science and synthetic chemistry, and will pursue
              fundamental theoretical understandings of complex chemical systems that combine
              mesoscale and nanoscale phenomena in complex fluids, hydrogels, and molecular
              recognition chemistry.  This work is to be based on the intelligent polymerized
              crystalline colloidal array (IPCCA) materials recently developed in the labs of
              the PIs.  The IPCCA material consists of a mesoscopically periodic array of
              colloidal particles polymerized into an acrylamide hydrogel.
