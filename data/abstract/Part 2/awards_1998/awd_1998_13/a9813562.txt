Abstract    :
                The study is designed to determine the effects of the current (1997-98) El
              Ni¹o event on the nearshore giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) communities
              throughout this species entire range (central Baja, Mexico to A¹o Nuevo,
              California; see Foster & Schiel, 1985 for a review on giant kelp distribution).
               The current (1997-98) El Ni¹o is considered one of the strongest on record
              (NOAA Multivariate ENSO Index) with widespread, storm-induced damage already
              occurring along much of the eastern Pacific.  In addition to widespread damage
              to terrestrial environments from flooding and strong winds, unusually large
              ocean waves have impacted the coast of California and Baja, having severe
              impacts on their coastal marine systems.  To examine the effects of the current
              El Ni¹o event on the giant kelp forests of this region, field surveys will be
              done to compare changes in their community structure resulting from large ocean
              waves and increased sea temperatures before, during and after this event, and
              throughout their entire range in this region. Collected data will be
              supplemented by unpublished data from the PI's as well as published research on
              kelps in the area. Altogether, these data will allow for evaluation of both
              inter- and intraannual variation in the structure of giant kelp communities
              along their entire distribution in the Pacific Northeast, with specific
              attention on years characterized by El Ni¹o and La Ni¹a events, and provide
              valuable information on the relative importance of various oceanographic
              conditions on these changes.
