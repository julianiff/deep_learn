Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS 9813595    Principal Investigator:  L. Chow,
              R-H Chen      This award is to investigate the fundamental processes involved
              in spray cooling.  In a previous study, the PIs developed a semi-transparent
              synthetic-diamond heater which could produce critical heat fluxes in water and
              FC-72.  With this heater, bubble histories could be recorded on video.  The
              proposed work will clarify the effects of nucleation, secondary nucleation, and
              premature bubble removal by impinging spray droplets on the heat transfer and
              the critical heat flux.  This will be done by measuring bubble growth rate,
              bubble size, and bubble population across the heater surface using the video
              imaging system.  The study will correlate nucleation with the spray
              characteristics of mass flow rate, droplet size and number density. 
              Estimations of the relative significance of surface and secondary nucleation
              will improve the understanding of the spray process and provide benchmark data
              for future work.
