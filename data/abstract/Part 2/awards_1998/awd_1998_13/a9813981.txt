Abstract    :
              9813981  Klein       RAND Corporation will spend one year in a feasibility study
              to identify opportunities and challenges in assessing student achievement
              through a "National Internet Testing System" (NIT).  The study will focus on
              how this type of system could use computerized adaptive tests (CATs) and
              computer-delivered performance-based tasks to assess student proficiency in
              science and mathematics in ways that are valid, reliable, cost-effective, and
              fair.    A "bank" of items will be administered to students in a way that is
              continuously tailored to that student's achievement level.  It is anticipated
              that the CAT items will be categorized in accordance with local, state, and
              national standards, and these clarifications can be encoded into the system so
              that items can be aligned with a site's curriculum.  Advantages of CAT testing
              are they are customized to a student's level, they are quicker to administer,
              and scores can be reported almost immediately.  Potentially, scores could be
              linked to NAEP and state tests.
