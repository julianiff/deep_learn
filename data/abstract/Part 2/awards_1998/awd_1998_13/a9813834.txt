Abstract    :
              The investigators will use an airglow imaging instrument to measure atmospheric
              gravity waves with horizontal wavelengths less than 100 km.  They will place a
              new infrared airglow imager with high sensitivity at the Starfire Optical site
              in New Mexico.  The imager will be used in conjunction with other Starfire
              instrumentation to investigate the breakdown of gravity waves as well as the
              momentum flux deposited by acoustic gravity waves, which are believed to be
              thermally ducted from source regions thousands of kilometers away.  The
              investigators will also analyze airglow imaging data from northern Germany,
              comparing the results with similar data obtained from Illinois.  At the German
              site, mesopause temperatures can be less than 1250 K, while in Illinois the
              temperatures are usually greater than 170K.  In 1999, the imager will be
              deployed in Australia for two years, a period of time long enough to allow a
              better characterization of gravity wave climatology in the southern hemisphere
              at mid-latitude.
