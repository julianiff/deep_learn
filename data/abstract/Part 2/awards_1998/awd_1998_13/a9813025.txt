Abstract    :
              Coping with the massive amounts of data produce by multi-teraflop or petaflop
              computers is a fundamental problem in scientific computing.  This proposal
              provides support for two workshops, which are part of the continuing series of
              NSF/DOE workshops on "Visualization and Data Corridors."   The first of these
              workshops, to be held in Bodega Bay, California, April 6-8, will survey the
              state of the art of manufacturers of graphics hardware and I/O systems.   The
              second, to be held in Duck, North Carolina May 19-21, is retreat to help
              organize the anticipated federal initiative in this area.  Together these two
              workshops will develop a set of requirements for the planned "visualization and
              data corridor" and develop a technology roadmap leading to the development of
              such corridors.
