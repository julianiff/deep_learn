Abstract

In recent years the
              importance of stochastic analysis and stochastic
control theory in financial
              applications has become apparent.  The best
known example is the Black-Scholes
              option pricing formula which has
spawned a $15 trillion industry in options
              trading.  The significance
of this connection is demonstrated by the work of
              the 1997 recipients
of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Professors Robert Merton
              and Myron
Scholes.  One of the crucial assumptions which underlies the theory
              of
Black, Merton, and Scholes is that full information is available about
the
              markets.  Markets for which this is true are known as complete
markets. 
              Current research concentrates on incomplete markets.
Incompleteness of the
              markets corresponds to partial observations in
stochastic control theory. 
              Recent advances in the theory and numerical
approaches for these type of
              problems make it desirable to bring
together leading specialists from academia
              and research groups of
financial institutions.  This is even more imperative
              since very often
in the past efforts within academia have been expended on
              finding
highly technical answers to the wrong questions.  This conference
              will
include practitioners who are well-acquainted with the
              sophisticated
mathematics used in mathematical finance to present to the
              academicians
the real issues and problems of interest to the financial
              industry.
