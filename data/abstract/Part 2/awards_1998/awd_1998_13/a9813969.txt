Title:
              Continuous Holocene Records of Paleo-El Nino Events from Laminated Lacustrine
              Sediment Cores from Southern Ecuador

This award supports a study designed to
              recover and analyze sediment cores spanning the last 12,000 years from lakes in
              southwestern Ecuador.  The study has the potential to provide the first
              continuous, high-resolution record of large magnitude paleo-El Nino events from
              a region that historically has been one of the most sensitive land areas to the
              ENSO.  These records will shed light on variations in the frequency of El Nino
              events through the Holocene and on the issue of the age of onset of the ENSO in
              the Nino 1 region.  The ENSO time series derived from lakes in southern Ecuador
              will enable a comparison  of the frequency of El Nino events in the Nino 1 zone
              with oceanic conditions that prevailed at various times across the tropical
              Pacific.  Such a comparison would further the evaluation of several models that
              have been developed to determine the atmospheric and oceanographic factors that
              control the frequency and severity of El Nino events, including the future
              frequency and severity of ENSO in an enhanced greenhouse world.
