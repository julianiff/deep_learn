The investigators will conduct a three-year research program
              during which equatorial electrodynamics and the development of plasma structure
              will be monitored for the first time in the central Pacific.  Understanding the
              electrodynamics of the low-latitude ionosphere is critical to problems related
              to the global dynamo system and ion-neutral coupling.  The investigators will
              use a frequency agile radar (FAR) to make the needed measurements.  The FAR,
              currently deployed on the island of Pohnpei in the central Pacific, offers a
              means to monitor this under-sampled region of the ionosphere.  The
              investigators will minimize costs by using an antenna system already in place
              on the island.  The resulting data will provide the basis for comprehensive
              investigations of various electrodynamical conditions that lead to plasma
              structuring in the equatorial ionosphere.  The measurements will also support
              two satellites to be launched within the next two years.
