Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9813784       COBABE, EMILY  UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS    The
              project will explore at least one arctic lake for the presence of
              alkenone-producing algae.  If found, the presence of alkenones will allow the
              investigator to develop a tool for determining the paleotemperature of lake
              sediments for the first time as has been done for marine sediments where
              alkenone-producing algae are known to exist.  At present, the paleotemperature
              is inferred from proxy data sources such as of diatoms, pollen, and geochemical
              tracers that have not been calibrated to absolute temperature with any
              certainty.  The development of the new paleotemperature tool will greatly
              facilitate reconstruction of arctic climate regimes as well as provide
              important data for model simulation validations.
