Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the question of the detailed structure of organic films. 
              Use of these films in a variety of electro- optical applications requires a
              detailed knowledge of the structural organization of the thin films, including
              the molecular orientation and the structural uniformity.  Professor Rowlen of
              the University of Colorado applies angle resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy to
              the investigation of the evloution of orientation within these self-assembled
              organic monolayers and multilayers.  The design and construction of a near
              field optical microscope using photoacoustic detection is a part of this
              research effort.  Application of these methods and scanning force microscopy to
              the determination of the roughness of thin film substrate materials and the
              effect of roughness on molecular orientation in the layers is also pursued.
              

The orientation and structural uniformity of organic thin films is
              important in the design and implementation of thin film electro-optic devices. 
              Methods to determine this information are underway in the laboratory of
              Professor Rowlen at the University of Colorado.  Photoacoustic spectroscopy,
              near field scanning optical microscopy, and scanning force microscopy are all
              used to evaluate the roughness of the film substrates and the molecular
              orientation of the overlying organic layers.  A detailed knowledge of the
              structure and orientation of these overlayers is then used in the construction
              of electro-optic devices.
