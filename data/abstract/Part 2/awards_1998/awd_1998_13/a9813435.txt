Abstract    :
              IBN 98-13435  CARNEVALE     The aim of this project is to teach scientists how
              to use NEURON,  a powerful tool for simulating the function of nerve cells and 
              brain circuits. This award supports a satellite short-course  presented
              annually at the Society for Neuroscience meeting.  The  course instructs
              neuroscience investigators and teachers how to  use a widely-accepted
              simulation tool designed specifically for  biologically realistic neural
              models.  Since it runs on all  leading computational platforms (UNIX/Linux,
              MSWindows 3.1, 95,  98, and NT, and MacOS), virtually every laptop and desktop 
              microcomputer sold in the country is capable of performing  research-quality
              simulations.    The potential importance of NEURON to the neuroscience
              community  derives from the fact that the nervous systems of all animals, 
              including human beings, perform tasks such as perception,  learning, and
              adaptive control, through computations that involve  the complex interactions
              of electrical and chemical signals that  are distributed in space and time.
              Scientists are increasingly  finding simulation to be an indispensable tool for
              understanding  the operation of systems with such complex interactions.  The 
              NEURON course will teach the use of such a tool for applications  in
              neuroscience.
