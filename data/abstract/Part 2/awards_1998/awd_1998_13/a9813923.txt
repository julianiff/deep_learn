This five year Local Systemic Change in Science, 6-12, provides
              a consortium of the Seattle Public Schools, Bellevue, Northshore, Highline, and
              Shoreline School districts along with the University of Washington and other
              community partners to infuse inquiry-based teaching of exemplary curricula into
              all middle schools in the five school districts.  All of these districts are
              contiguous.  All middle school science teachers will have at least 165 hours of
              formal professional development over the five years.  Whole science departments
              from each school will participate together. Inquire-based learning experiences,
              based around exemplary curricula, will be provided through summer institutes,
              school-based implementation support during each year, and ongoing partnerships
              participating teachers. Resource Teachers, and teams of scientists.  350
              teachers will be directly involved in the project.
