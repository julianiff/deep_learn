Abstract    :
              "Doctoral Dissertation Research: Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation of Ancient
              Eastern North American Arctic Peoples"

The questions addressed here have to
              do with the genetic admixture between the people of the Paleoeskimo Dorset and
              Neoeskimo Thule cultures. Was there contact between the bearers of these
              cultures as the Thule culture spread across the Canadian Arctic? Or,
              alternatively, had the Dorset bearers disappeared before the Thule culture
              arrived in the Canadian Arctic? Further, who where the Sadlermiut of
              Southampton Island? To answer these questions, ancient DNA will be extracted
              from skeletal material excavated at Eastern North American Arctic arhaeological
              sites spanning the West coast of Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay in Canada to
              Greenland. The hypervariable segment 1 (HVS 1) of the mitochondrial genome will
              be amplified from the ancient DNA samples using the Polymerase Chain Reaction
              (PCR) and sequenced. Pairwise sequence differences will be used in phylogenetic
              analyses to assess the genetic relationship between peoples of the Dorset,
              Thule, and Sadlermiut cultures. The results will address the current debate
              over the evolutionary relationships between members of the prehistoric Dorset
              and Thule cultures and assess whether the Sadlermiut are more closely related
              to the Dorset, Thule, or living Inuit groups.
