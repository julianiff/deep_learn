The objective of this research is to develop a computer
              program that will improve the process of prescribing wheelchairs to children. 
              This research will take place in four phases which include: (1)
              characterization of the forces needed to propel a pediatric wheelchair, (2)
              musculoskeletal model and movement simulation, (3) prescription guideline
              development and validation, and (4) computer assisted wheelchair prescription
              software development.  The results of this research could benefit therapists,
              wheelchair dealers and pediatric wheelchair users.
