Abstract    :
              UCLA has been selected by the American Physical Society, Division of Particles
              and Fields (DPF) Executive Committee to host the 1998/1999 meeting of the DPF. 
              This is the 9-th meeting in the series of such meetings and follows the 1996
              meeting hosted by the universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin.  The meeting
              will be held on the UCLA campus from 5 through 9 January 1999.  The scientific
              program will be a mixture of parallel and plenary talks covering such topics as
              diverse as Electroweak Interactions, Neutrino Masses and Oscillations, Heavy
              Quark Physics, Weak Decays and CP Violation, QCD, Physics Beyond the Standard
              Model, Quantum Gravity, Cosmology and Dark Matter, and High Energy
              Astrophysics.  This conference will be attended by scientists from all over the
              world, and this grant will enable a number of students and post-docs to
              participate.
