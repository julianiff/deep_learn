     Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the
              most critical steps in the production of multilayer silicon microelectronic
              devices.  It has become one of the key roadblock issues in semiconductor
              manufacturing today.  The decreasing line widths of semiconductor devices
              require new materials that further challenge the process.  The objective of the
              proposed research is to use acoustic emission sensing technology to investigate
              the material removal mechanisms in CMP and as a basis for process monitoring. 
              Material removal in CMP is dependent on both chemical and mechanical actions at
              the interface between the pad and the wafer surface.  The focus here is on the
              mechanical interactions.  The project will seek to determine the dependency of
              material removal (both at a specific point and over the wafer surface) on
              process variables such as work/pad gap thickness, abrasive size and shape, and
              polishing pad characteristics.  In addition, pad design and patterning is
              important, and thus a basis for pad texture/groove design and optimization will
              be included.  Process monitoring in CMP will focus on process variables
              important to work quality and production rate including pad wear and
              degradation, microscratching and other surface defects as well as uniformity 
              over the wafer surface.
     The project is expected to advance the
              understanding of process mechanics and capability for process monitoring using
              acoustic emission on CMP.  The collaboration with NIST provides excellent
              synergy for project resources and is valuable to education and technology
              transfer.
