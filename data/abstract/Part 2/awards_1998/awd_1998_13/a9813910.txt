Abstract    :
              This award will support the postdoctoral research of Dr. Jorge Chau at the
              Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru.  The research has two parts:  (1) the
              study of the east-west symmetry in 50 MHz radar echoes from the equatorial
              electrojet, and (2) the study of meridional variations in the E-region
              irregularities.  For the first task, the investigators will examine whether or
              not the penetration of gravity wave energy associated with the nearby Andean
              Cordillera may play a role in sustaining the observed asymmetry in the radar
              echoes.  For the second task, the investigators will use simultaneous
              measurements made with the Jicamarca radar and a 50 MHz wind profiler radar in
              Piura, Peru, about 1000 km north of Jicamarca.  The researchers will look for
              possible differences in nighttime echoes in Piura related to the presence or
              absence of spread F over Jicamarca at magnetically connected locations in the
              ionosphere.
