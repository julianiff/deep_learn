The investigators will develop a Kalman filtering technique for
              global wind mapping. Kalman filtering uses statistics and sequential estimation
              to produce daily gridded synoptic mappings from asynchronous satellite
              measurements.  Global daily synoptic mappings enable objective determination of
              spatial wave propagation and day-to-day variability of planetary scale
              features.  Synoptic fields lend themselves easily to conventional
              longitude-time Fourier analysis and are convenient for assimilation into
              numerical models.  Because of their ease of interpretation, mapped synoptic
              fields have been widely used by the scientific community investigating
              tropospheric and stratospheric dynamics.  However, the Kalman filtering
              approach traditionally requires the prescription of planetary-scale geophysical
              statistics, which are largely unknown for mesospheric and lower thermospheric
              winds.  The main objective of this study is to determine these unknown
              statistics from an existing lower thermospheric wind data set.  The results
              will be used to support CEDAR/TIMED science goals.  CEDAR, which stands for
              Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change
              program that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to
              study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere,
              Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to
              study similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to
              coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better
              understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.
