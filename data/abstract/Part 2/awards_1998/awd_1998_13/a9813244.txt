Abstract    :
              Recent work has demonstrated that high velocity metal forming can stretch metals
              considerably further than traditional quasi-static forming.  Further, practical
              strategies have been developed to use high-velocity electromagnetic forming to
              produce complex, low-cost sheet components. Applying this technology to
              aluminum can provide significant cost savings in aircraft manufacture and the
              ability to inexpensively produce lighter weight automotive structures.   While
              many of the controlling factors for the high velocity forming process have been
              identified, there is little basic understanding of the mechanisms that produce
              the extended ductility and also very little data on the formability of sheet
              metals at the high velocities. In this program, the strains to failure of
              aluminum alloys shall be measured in high velocity forming using both simple
              boundary conditions that lend themselves to basic understanding as well as
              complex conditions that are more relevant to manufacturing.  These experimental
              tests will be highly instrumented to capture the dynamic behavior. The
              experimental results of this GOALI project will be used to develop models of
              high velocity sheet metal formability, which should have significant industrial
              application in predicting processing capability
