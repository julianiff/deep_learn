Abstract    :
              This experimental investigation addresses atmospheric bromine chemistry. Bromine
              dioxide, OBrO, has recently been reported to be present in the atmosphere as a
              principal night-time bromine species, implying a potentially important role for
              OBrO chemistry at night time. The chemical fate and atmospheric role of the
              OBrO radical have not been determined. Preliminary model simulations indicate
              that the homogeneous reactions of OBrO with ozone, nitric oxide, and chlorine
              monoxide affect the stratospheric ozone budget and bromine species
              partitioning, particularly in the lower stratosphere where ozone concentrations
              are greatest. It is possible that OBrO strongly interacts with polar
              stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Kinetic rate parameters for the interactions
              between OBrO and O3, NO, ClO and water-ice will be measured under stratospheric
              conditions using a fast flow reactor coupled with mass spectrometry.
              Preliminary laboratory results indicate that  OBrO is several times more
              reactive than OClO towards NO at room temperature.
