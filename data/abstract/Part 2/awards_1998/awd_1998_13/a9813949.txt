Abstract    :
              The project initiates a research program aimed at developing a new family of
              temperature sensors which measure temperature by monitoring the decay time of
              fluorescence.  The work will focus on sensors which utilize oxide crystals
              doped with rare earth ions which exhibit a strong temperature dependence in
              their multiphonon relaxation or phonon assisted energy transfer.  The lifetime
              measurements will yield information on the lattice anhormonicity effects in
              Y3A15012 and Y203 at elevated temperatures.  This knowledge will guide the
              selection of future materials for such sensors, but also in understanding the
              behavior of these materials in high temperature composites and opto-thermal
              devices.
