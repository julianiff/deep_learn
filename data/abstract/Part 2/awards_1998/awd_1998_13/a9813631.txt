Abstract    :
              For the 1998 Forum, Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) proposes a
              two-phase strategy to ensure greater likelihood of future collaborations.  It
              is not enough to have a generic indication of interest from industry.  Rather,
              for collaborations and consortia to be formed, it is critical to match the
              specific research projects of university researchers with the commercialization
              needs and expectations of industry.  CERF will identify those projects whose
              potential commercial applications offer significant enough interest to industry
              to encourage their collaboration with academia.  By matching the current and
              planned efforts taking place under NSF auspices with the strategic needs of
              industry, CERF will identify research `clusters` of significant interest to
              industry and academia.  CERF will recommend holding the Collaborations Forum
              only if a sufficient number of industry representatives express specific
              interest and make explicit pledges indicating a desire to work in developing a
              collaboration with academic researchers.
