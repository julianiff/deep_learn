Abstract    :
              With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. G. Barney Ellison of the Department of Chemistry at the
              Universito of Colorado in Boulder.   The work will involve studying the
              oxidation of  monolayer films of surfactant molecules (such as stearic acid,
              oleic acid, or 1-oleoyo-2-palmitoyl-3-phosphatyclcholine) plated  on NaCl and
              bombarded with hydroxyl radicals (generated by a corona discharge of H2O in Ar
              and filtered by an electrostatic hexapole), in the presence of atmospheric
              gases such as O2, NO, SO2, or O3.   Reactions at the surface will be followed
              by infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopies in a vacuum chamber, and any small
              molecules emitted measured with a residual gas analyzer.  

The reactions to
              be studied in the research proposed, involving the oxidation of thin organic
              layers on solid NaCl, are models for the reactions taking place on the outer
              surfaces of atmospheric aerosol particles over oceans, where biogenic
              surfactant molecules coat brine droplets formed from ocean spray.  
              Understanding the chemistry is important for modeling the roles of aerosol
              particles in cloud formation, global warming, and ozone depletion.
