Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9813770  Tung, Ka-Kit  University of Washington  Title: Two-Way
              Interactions of Tropics and Extra-tropics in  Stratospheric Variability    The
              proposed work will  investigate the effect of the extra-tropics  on the
              equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the effect of  the equatorial QBO
              on the extra-tropics as well as any feedback  processes which this two-way
              interaction implies.  A realistic  numerical model will be used to study
              various mechanisms linking  the tropics and the extra-tropics and for
              validation of model  prediction of circulation anomalies, observations of trace
              gases  such as ozone, methane and water vapor will be utilized.  The  proposed
              work is important since it  will enhance our understanding  of the role of the
              stratosphere in climate.
