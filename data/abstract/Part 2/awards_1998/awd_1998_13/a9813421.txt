This two-year award will support US-Netherlands cooperative
              research between James Powell of Utah State University and Wopke van der Werf
              at Wageningen Agricultural University in The Netherlands.  The objective of the
              collaboration is to develop spatial models for biocontrol of fungal diseases. 
              A robust model for bio-control based on integro-difference equations will be
              constructed at both substrate and crop level.  The models will be connected
              mathematically using analytic and computational homogenization techniques. 
              

The Wageningen group has broad experience in the application and
              construction of models for ecological management and the PI brings to the
              collaboration his experience as a mathematical ecologist.  The collaboration is
              expected to enhance understanding of spatial effects in ecology, use
              homogenization to connect varying scales in a realistic ecological problem, and
              establish spatial modeling as a useful technique in evaluating bio-control
              problems.
