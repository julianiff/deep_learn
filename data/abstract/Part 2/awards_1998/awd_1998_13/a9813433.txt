	The American Academy of Microbiology will convene an
              interdisciplinary colloquium of leading scientists to deliberate and develop a
              comprehensive, analytical report, and action plan.  The colloquium will bring
              together 30-35 scientists from the USA and abroad for intense, highly focuses
              deliberations in small groups.  The colloquium will focus on the
              following:

À   Selection of microbial genomes, prioritization, logistics and
              technical aspects.
À   Inference of function from full genome sequence.
À  
              Data and technology management, access, funding, and public policy
À   Role
              for professional societies, such as the American Society for Microbiology.
   
                      
                A report will be prepared containing the in-depth
              analysis of the issues and recommendations for a future plan of action, and
              disseminated to the scientific community, to federal agencies, to policy
              makers, and to the public.
