              Abstract-Form 10    P.I.: Ervin J. Fenyves    Title: Group Travel for U.S.
              participants in the 19th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, Paris,
              France, December 14-18, 1998.    This award is for travel funds (air fares
              only) for 20 U.S. scientists to attend the 19th Texas Symposium on Relativistic
              Astrophysics to be held in Paris, France on 14-18 December 1998. The biannual
              Texas Symposia discuss recent developments in relativistic astrophysics. The
              topics this year cover a wide range of subjects, including AGNs, the cosmic
              microwave background, the early universe, and general relativity. There will be
              three associated conferences before the Symposium, as well.
