Abstract    :
              9813778  Kennedy  The objective of this research is the development of a 
              device, IBEX, which enables bedridden geriatric patients to  exercise.  This
              research is in collaboration with a company,  Synergy Innovations.  Literature
              is cited that indicates  that patients confined to a bed tend to undergo loss
              of  muscle mass, which leads to eventual immobility and higher  mortality. 
              Moreover, there is a lack of physical therapists  in the country and most
              bedridden patients do not receive  the recommended two sessions per day.  The
              proposal seeks to  fund a graduate student who will conduct a number of studies
               on the applicability and utility of the IBEX system.  ***
