This Americas Program award will support travel and
              related expenses for seven participants, including three US senior scientists
              and four US and LA  post- and pre-doctoral students, to attend a workshop on
              the newest advances in developmental genetics, to be held in Santiago, Chile,
              January 11-23, 1999, in conjunction with an international symposium.  
              Organizers are Dr. Gerald Schatten, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center,
              and Dr.Roberto Mayor, University of Chile. The objective of the workshop is to
              enhance the level of cell and developmental biology teaching and research
              through lectures, direct laboratory experimentation, and formal and informal
              discussions.   Several innovative technologies, including advanced imaging,
              will be discussed to familiarize the participants with modern approaches for
              exploring structural events at the cell and molecular level.  

The workshop
              will help foster the career development of promising students, both from the US
              and Latin America, and will help stimulate new collaborations among US and
              South American scientists.
