              Mentor Project    The goal of this project is to increase the number of women
              entering graduate programs in CISE areas by providing opportunities for women
              undergraduates to be involved in research projects with female mentors at major
              research universities so as to experience research and graduate life. This goal
              is in accord with the need to increase the number of women in responsible,
              high-level positions in CISE areas. The project provides support for twenty-two
              women undergraduates in each of three years to work with experienced and
              qualified mentors during summer months. In addition, the project includes a
              significant evaluation component, a plan for dissemination of the results of
              the evaluation and a plan for working toward long-term funding and
              institutionalization of the project.
