Description: This award is to support a US-Egypt Workshop
              on Natural Products Chemistry, to be held in Cairo, Egypt, in January 1999. 
              The US organizer is Dr. Philip Le Quesne, Professor of Chemistry at
              Northeastern University, Boston, MA.  The Egyptian organizer is Dr. Nabiel
              Saleh, President, National Research Center (NRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  The
              objectives of the four-day workshop are: review the state of knowledge of
              natural products, especially those pertinent to Egypt; exchange information
              between US and Egyptian scientists to encourage the development of cooperative
              projects; and identify priority topics for potential joint research proposals. 
              The topics to be discussed include isolation and structure determination of
              natural products, natural products in medicine and biology, and synthetic
              chemistry of natural products.  The scientists will also visit some of the
              major academic and industrial research laboratories in Egypt.

Scope:  This
              workshop will bring together US and Egyptian scientists in various areas of
              natural products research to develop an agenda for joint research.  Dr. Le
              Quesne has had a long experience in field studies and chemical analysis of
              natural products in several foreign countries.  It is expected that the
              National Institutes of Health (NIH) will support the participation of two NIH
              scientists in the workshop.  The Egyptian organizer, Dr. Saleh, is the head of
              the largest government research laboratory in Egypt, and is a well-respected
              natural product chemist.  The NRC has a strong group in that field with diverse
              interests and specialties.  It is planned to publish a proceedings covering the
              presentations and the recommended areas for joint US-Egypt research projects. 
              This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting joint workshops that are
              likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest.
