Abstract    :
               This award provides partial support for a cluster of eight workshops centered
              around automated learning and decision making based on data. The meeting is
              held at Carnegie Mellon University on June 11-13, 1998. It covers scientific
              research at the intersection of statistics, computer science, artificial
              intelligence, databases, social sciences and language technologies. The aim of
              this meeting is to initiate a dialogue between these disciplines. By doing do,
              it seeks to attain two types of impacts. First, it aims to generate synergy
              between previously separated fields, to lead to new, cross-disciplinary
              research collaborations and new, unified research approaches. Second, it
              attempts to provide guidance to the scientific community by characterizing the
              state-of-the-art, pointing out possible overlaps, making people aware of
              research results in other fields, and identifying some of the most promising
              cross-disciplinary research directions. One of the results of this meeting will
              be a written report, which will be made available to NSF and the scientific
              community at large, by posting it on the Web, and by submitting it to a widely
              accessible magazine or journal.
