Abstract    :
              
Primary and secondary metabolism intersect in the one-carbon (1-c) area with
              primary metabolism supplying most of the 1-c units and competing with secondary
              metabolism for their use.  This competition is potentially severe because plant
              secondary metabolism imposes hugh demands for 1-c units, especially methyl
              groups for the synthesis of lignin, alkaloids and osmoprotectant compounds such
              as glycine betaine and D-onoitol.  As many current metabolic engineering
              projects aim to change levels of these products, and hence methyl group demand,
              it is essential that one understands how 1-c metabolism is regulated so that
              one can successfully engineer the 1-c supply to match demand.  To do this
              requires skills in molecular biology, metabolic and analytical chemistry, in
              vivo NMR, and computer modeling.  These skills will come from five Principal
              Investigators (PIs) with complementary and overlapping expertise.  All PIs are
              used to doing interdisciplinary teamwork.
