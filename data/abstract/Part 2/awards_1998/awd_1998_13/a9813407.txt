Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9813407  BOSE    The power industry must undertake a managed
              redesign of the Nation's power system so that it can adopt to deregulation and
              to rapid changes in the power requirements and economic conditions.  A planning
              grant, EEC-9725138, was awarded to Washington State University to determine the
              feasibility and viability of becoming a research site associated with the
              Industry/ University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems
              Engineering.  The Washington State University has met the I/UCRC Program
              requirements to become the fifth university in this multi-university center
              involving Cornell University, the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of California-Berkeley with
              Howard University as an affiliate.     The new research site's agenda will
              initially address 1.) Nonlinear Analysis and Control of Oscillations, 2.)
              Strategies for Price-based Unit Commitment, 3.) Corona Streamer for Design of
              High Voltage Hardware and 4.) On-line Dynamic Security Assessment.
