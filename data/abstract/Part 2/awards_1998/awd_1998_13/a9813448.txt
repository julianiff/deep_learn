Abstract    :
              This small grant for exploratory research studies the cultural models of the
              disease Pfiesteria Piscicida, which caused lesioned and dead fish in a number
              of rivers of the eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  The anthropologist
              researchers, from the University of Maryland, will interview various sets of
              stakeholders including farmers, watermen, and environmentalists, to assess
              their understanding of the disease and of solutions to the problem. The degree
              to which the models are shared will be determined, and the possibility of
              facilitating dialogue between the diverse groups will be assessed.  Methods
              will include interviews with 30-50 persons per stakeholder group, using a
              variety of cognitive anthropology techniques to identify cultural domains.  A
              consensus analysis will be performed on the data to assess the communal nature
              of the models.  Focus groups will be used to enlist the assistance of the
              respondents in interpreting the results of the data analysis.  The study will
              support the development of cultural analysis in ecological problems, which is
              important because these problems involve local, regional and global stakeholder
              groups.  At a more specific level the research will contribute to theory and
              methods that seek to understand the construction of cultural models of
              environmental problems, and account for the level of consensus among diverse
              groups for the same environmental problem.  This knowledge will help public
              officials as well as involved groups communicate with each other to resolve
              their differences.
