Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9813481  BOWMAN    This award to the University of Colorado is to
              study the feasibility of establishing an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for the Study of Fundamental and Applications of
              Photopolymerizations.  The proposed Center will represent a collaboration of
              scientists and engineers from Michigan State University, University of
              Colorado, and industrial companies.  The specific planning objectives are to:
              (1) assess the research interests and needs of the target industries through an
              active dialog with industrial scientists and engineers; and (2) establish
              active support and participation of a variety of industries.  The initial
              portfolio of research projects, and the structure and organization of the
              proposed center will be discussed at an industry/university workshop to be held
              at the end of the grant period.
