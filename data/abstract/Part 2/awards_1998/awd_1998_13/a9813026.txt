Abstract    :
              Robust failure theories are developed that proerly capture the deformation and
              failure mechanisms corresponding to multiaxial stress/deformation states, based
              on realistic experiments that simulate the essential ingredients present in a
              crash situation. A combination of experiments and analysis are conducted to
              study failure mechanisms and failure strength of composite structures under
              simple states of biaxial and uniaxial test simulating a variety of loading
              states. Improved material models are developed that serve as input to
              calculations for crash analysis.
