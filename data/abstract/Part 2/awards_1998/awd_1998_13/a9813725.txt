Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Dr. Harold Hietala, MS Mary Clark will collect data for
              her doctoral dissertation. Her research focuses on reconstructing the
              prehistoric social organization of the Jenne-jeno settlement complex which lies
              within the Inland Niger Delta of Mali, a vast floodplain characterized by a
              mosaic of landforms and soil types. Prior archaeological reconnaissance within
              the area has led to the discovery of over 400 sites within an 1100 km square
              area, the greatest density of which occurs within a 4 km radius around the
              modern town of Jenne. Here, sixty-nine mound sites ranging from 0.12 to 60 ha.
              have been identified, the majority of which are arranged in discrete spatial
              clusters. In general, the clusters are characterized by one or two larger sites
              and a number of smaller ones within 200 m. of each other. This pattern has been
              observed in at least three other basins of the Middle Niger suggesting it is
              not unique to one region alone and thus likely reflects a basic form of social
              organization. In a highly original series of studies Susan and Roderick
              McIntosh, the archaeological pioneers in this region suggest that a state level
              of organization was present and that it was based in heterarchical rather than
              hierarchical principles. A heterarchical organization is one where economic and
              political power is horizontally (spatially) dispersed and shared between
              several loci rather than spatially centralized. The concept is interesting
              because in all other areas in both Old and New World where this level of
              complexity is reached, organization is primarily on hierarchical lines. This
              suggests greater variation in the organization of simple states than generally
              assumed.  The McInstosh's work, while based on intensive excavation at a
              limited number of sites does not rest on a broad and solid regional base. To
              remedy this situation, MS Clark conducted a large scale survey supplemented by
              limited excavations. She now wishes to obtain crucial radiocarbon dates to
              determine which sites are synchronous with each other. She also wishes to have
              specialists analyze the botanical, faunal and floral remains recovered to
              provide insight into craft specialization and subsistence practices. With sites
              securely dated and the range of archaeologically visible activities determined,
              it will then be possible to evaluate whether a heterarchical pattern is in fact
              present.  This research is important for several reasons. It will evaluate
              evidence for a suggested unique form of spatial organization. It will provide
              data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising
              young scientist.                                           ^¿ú             +?+¬
