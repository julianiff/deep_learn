Abstract    :
              IBN-9813994  LAY ABSTRACT      An   International   Conference  "Progress  in 
              Motor   Control-II:  Structure-Function Relations in the Perceptual Control  of
               Voluntary  Movements"  is  planned for the last three days in August  1999. 
              The  Conference will take place in the Nittany Lion Inn, on the campus  of  the
                Pennsylvania  State  University,  University  Park,  PA.   This  conference
              will represent the second step along the much-needed route  towards 
              integration  of  information in  the  area  of  sensorimotor  control.  The 
              participation of the spectrum of the invited  speakers  will  make  it unique
              and attractive for potential participants.  The  Conference   will  cover  the 
              following  topics:  Neurophysiological  Aspects  of Sensorimotor Control of
              Movements; Perceptual Control  of  Movement;   Biomechanics;   Motor  
              Disorders;   Motor   Development;  Psychophysiology  of Movements; Models and
              Theories  in  Sensorimotor  Control.  All  topics will emphasize an integrative
              approach  to  the  study of adaptive behavior. The focus of this particular
              meeting will  be  on  the interactions between neurophysiological and
              biomechanical  structures and their sensorimotor functions.    The  Conference
              will include 14 invited presentations, free  podium  presentations,  and poster
              sessions. Invited speakers  were  selected  based  on  their  integrative 
              approach to  movement  studies,  their  outstanding contribution to different
              areas of sensorimotor  control,  particularly  to understanding the role of
              various neurophysiological  structures  and  of  biomechanical factors  in  the
               coordination  of  voluntary  movements, and their international reputation. 
              Conference  abstracts  will  be  distributed  among  the  participants.  
              Invited  speakers  will write chapters that will be published  as  a  book  by 
              Human Kinetics Publishers.
