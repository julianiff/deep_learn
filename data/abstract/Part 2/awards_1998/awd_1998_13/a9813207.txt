Abstract    :
              9813207  German  The research will involve powder metallurgy process and its use
              in the fabrication of engineering shapes for applications ranging from
              automobiles to power tools. This study will determine the features needed to
              computer design the tooling, select the powder and alloy, and process the
              compacted metal powders into high performance structures that avoid expensive
              machining steps. To accomplish this task, the research plan consists of the
              integration of three major tasks:  (1) powder metallurgy processing; (2)
              density and quality monitoring via ultrasonic methods;  and (3) computer-based
              analysis and design. This will be accomplished by the compaction of steel
              powders to determine the dimensional and density change associated with the
              applied pressure and subsequent heat treatments. Gradients in the fabrication
              processes will be isolated though these experiments using diagnostic sensors
              and computer analysis.   The elimination of these gradients will improve
              product quality, improve precision, and lower production and development costs.
              This research will generate computer programs that embed process rules into the
              design phase to improve on the economies of the process and improve product
              quality.
