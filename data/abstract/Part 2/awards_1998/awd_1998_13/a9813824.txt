The microstructural origins of
              the yield stress and viscoelasticity in highly concentrated colloidal
              suspensions will be investigated.  The interparticle forces give rise to
              gelation, linear viscoelasticity and yielding.  Recent models based on
              flocculation, percolation and fractals will be experimentally tested using the
              small and wide-angle light scattering methods of model colloidal suspensions as
              they undergo yielding transition and shear.  Nearly refractive index matched
              suspensions of metal oxide particles (spheres and rods of variable aspect
              ratios) in both organic and aqueous solvent will be investigated for volume
              fractions between 0.02 and 0.2.  The project will examine the strain-induced
              changes in structure of the suspension just prior to yielding.  A connection
              between the microstructural phenomena and macroscopic rheological behavior will
              be obtained.   The proposed work has relevance in processing of colloidal
              suspensions in the manufacture of ceramics, magnetic storage media and
              coatings.
