Abstract    :
              This project consists of several activities aimed at improving our understanding
              of tropospheric aerosol chemistry.  The first activity is a continuation of the
              long-term Mauna Loa aerosol chemistry record.  This record includes aerosol
              nitrate/nitric acid, sulfate, methanesulfonate, magnesium, and calcium.  The
              second activity involves the design and field testing of airborne aerosol
              samplers.  This involves the testing of a total aerosol sampler (TAS) and the
              fabrication and testing of an impactor coupled to a porous diffuser, low
              turbulence inlet.  The third activity involves the planning and coordination of
              a major field experiment (ACE-Asia) directed at studying the composition and
              physical properties of aerosols in the outflow from eastern Asia, and their
              transformations during transport over the Pacific ocean.
