Abstract    :
              Signaling pathways underpin development in higher plants. Many studies have
              revealed that seemingly independent signaling pathways interact with each
              other, as in the case of responses to cytokinins, ethylene and light, or
              intersect as in the case of regulation of flowering by both photoperiod and
              giberrellins. This meeting will focus on recent results from cell biological
              and molecular genetic approaches which emphasize the role played by such
              interactions and intersections between different pathways in plant development,
              as well as in plant responses to environmental stresses and pathogens. A number
              of different topics will be covered, including interactions between pathways
              mediating responses to hormonal and environmental cues, developmental programs
              that require the transduction of signals through two or more distinct pathways
              for initiation, and the relationships of pathways involved in normal plant
              development to those involved in disease resistance.
