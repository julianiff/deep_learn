Abstract    :
              This project will extend the work on millimeter-wave scattering by ice crystals
              that was initiated in a previous NSF Grant, ATM-9225116.  The objective is to
              evaluate the scattering characteristics of ice crystals having many different
              shapes and sizes to aid in the interpretation of polarimetric radar
              observations of ice clouds.  The approach is to calculate the scattering from
              ice crystals and to compare the results with experimental measurements using
              mm-wave radars and airborne cloud-sampling equipment.  The calculations will be
              for three different radio frequencies, corresponding to those in use on
              short-wavelength radars: 35, 94, and 220 GHz (corresponding to wavelengths of
              8.6, 3.2, and 1.4 mm).   Because the wavelengths are comparable to the size of
              ice crystals, the Rayleigh or the geometric optics approximations for
              scattering cannot be used.  Instead, the Waterman T-matrix approach will be
              used for crystals that have no dimension larger than 0.1 mm and the
              computationally intensive finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method for all
              crystals larger than this size.  The scattering properties of clouds of ice
              crystals will be computed by integrating over a range of crystal sizes
              approximated by either gamma distributions or bimodal distributions, both of
              which have been found to describe cloud populations.  The calculations will
              include all measurable polarization parameters, such as vertical and horizontal
              reflectivity factors, differential reflectivity, differential phase shift, and
              copolarized correlation coefficient.  Comparison of the computed results with
              radar observations will be made through collaboration with groups at the
              University of Wyoming, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and the
              meteorology department at Penn State.  The goal of the work is to develop a
              method to estimate crystal habit and cloud ice content by radar.  The results
              would have application to both remote sensing and the parameterization of
              radiative transfer by ice clouds in large scale numerical models of the
              atmosphere.
