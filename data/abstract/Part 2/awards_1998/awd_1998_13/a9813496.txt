The objective of this research is to develop automated
              ventricular border detection algorithms to be used with three-dimensional image
              data.  This would be used to obtain cross-sectional areas, chamber volume, left
              ventricular chamber and wall shapes, and regional wall motion.  The
              investigators have been working on algorithms for segmentation of
              three-dimensional images based on stacks of two-dimensional images.  The
              objective is to extend these algorithms directly to three-dimensional data
              obtained from a volumetric ultrasound imaging system.  The main algorithm
              developed by the investigators is based on fitting a smooth surface to a rough
              estimate of the surface.  Smoothness is obtained by minimizing a cost function
              subject to several smoothness constraints which prohibit the fitted surface
              from changing more than a certain amount from one voxel to the next.  The
              optimum fit is obtained using a graph theoretic approach.  The goal is to
              provide accurate quantitative data that are not presently available in order to
              enable more accurate investigations of global and regional cardiac
              dysfunction.
