A pair of U.S.-Hungarian workshops featuring topics
              in discrete geometry and convexity shall be organized by Wlodzimierz Kuperberg
              of Auburn University and his partner, Gabor Fejes Toth of the Hungarian Academy
              of Sciences∆ Institute of Mathematics.  Plans involve holding the initial
              workshop in Budapest, Hungary, during July 1999 and a second in Auburn,
              Alabama, during March 2000.  The intent is to strengthen research ties between
              the two communities that will build upon Hungarian strengths in mathematical
              theory and U.S. strengths in operation research and computer science.   Results
              are expected to foster new U.S.-Hungarian research teams and subsequent
              publications in subjects featuring: packing density, Helly and Radon type
              results, problems related to motion planning and graphs, and new methods in
              convexity theory.

These mathematical workshops in geometric analysis fulfill
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in
              the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
