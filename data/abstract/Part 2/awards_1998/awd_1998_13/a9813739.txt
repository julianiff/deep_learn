This Americas Program award will support travel and
              related expenses for one senior and two junior researchers, to participate in a
              joint workshop on plant cell biology and signal transduction, to take place in
              Santiago, Chile on Nov. 13-16.  Organizers are Dr. Marteen Chrispeels, 
              University of California, San Diego and Dr. Ariel Orellana, University of
              Chile. The main objective is to bring Chilean researchers and their students in
              contact with US counterparts who have similar research goals with the purpose
              of discussing joint research projects.  A secondary goal is to strengthen the
              plant cell community in Chile and to expose their students to the rapidly
              advancing frontier in signal transduction in plant cells.  The workshop will
              consist of a series of lectures by both Chilean and US scientists, and
              discussions on how common interests can best be pursued  The discussions will
              focus on  very important current topics in plant cell biology, such as the role
              of the Golgi in biosynthesis and sorting, the role of potassium channels in
              signal transduction, and signal transduction in the disease and stress
              responses.   

Both countries will profit from this activity.  It will
              strengthen collaborative efforts between scientists of the two countries and
              stimulate interest among promising Chilean  graduate students in cutting-edge
              plant cell biology.
