This award supports the study of pattern formation in a variety
              of systems far from equilibrium.  The proposed work is on spatiotemperal chaos
              and seeks to explore the proposal that some properties of chaotic systems are
              extensive in the thermodynamic limit.  The PI together with a junior colleague
              have developed parallel codes and have secured resources on parallel computers
              in support of the proposed work.  Other theoretical issues that will be
              addressed include the derivation of a long wavelength, stochastic model, and a
              calculation of the structure factor for systems which exhibit spatiotemporal
              chaos.  These systems include Rayleigh-Benard convection (a paradigm for
              current experimental and theoretical studies of pattern formation in fluids and
              liquid crystals) and a generalized Burgers model of seismic wave propagation.

Research and education are supported by this award to investigate
              pattern formation in a variety of systems that are not in equilibrium.  The PI
              will use state-of-the-art computing as he seeks a deeper understanding of the
              fundamental physical principles that underlie pattern formation in seemingly
              diverse systems.  Examples of such systems that are also important to everyday
              life include the growth of crystals and turbulence.  This research will also
              contribute to a textbook that is being written by the PI in collaboration with
              another scholar and help advance the research career of  a junior investigator
              at Bowling Green University.
