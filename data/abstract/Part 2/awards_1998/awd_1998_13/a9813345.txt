     This grant funds the study of capacity in
              semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities through two related models: fluid
              models, which capture system dynamics, but ignore stochastic variability and
              multi-class queueing networks, which describe wafer fabs in considerable
              detail.  Analysis of Lyapunov functions applied to fluid models of the
              underlying queueing networks is intended to identify the sources of artificial
              bottlenecks that reduce the capacity of the fab below the limits imposed by
              individual tools.  This type of analysis can also identify whether or not a
              given dispatch policy or family of dispatch policies is susceptible to
              artificial bottlenecks. More detailed brownian models of the underlying
              queueing networks are intended to help distinguish among alternative policies
              on the basis of secondary performance criteria.  Finally, the grant funds
              efforts to work with simulation companies to implement families of practical
              and effective policies in their commercial software for use in wafer fabs.
   
               This research is intended to lead to improved utilization of expensive
              bottleneck tools in modern wafer fabs in three ways:  (1) by providing better
              understanding of how dispatch policies lead to artificial bottlenecks that
              unnecessarily reduce fab capacity; (2) by identifying  new efficient dispatch
              policies that consider the practical realities of wafer fabrication like setups
              and batching; and  (3)  by providing analytical and computational tools for for
              evaluating and optimizing  performance criteria like average
WIP and cycle
              time across families of efficient dispatch policies.
