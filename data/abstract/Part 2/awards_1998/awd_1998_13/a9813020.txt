Abstract    :
              DMI-9813020  Tucker  This research examines mixing of  inhomogeneous
              liquid-liquid systems, such as polymer blends.  Mixing determines the
              fine-scale morphology of these materials, and their solid-state properties. 
              This project is developing analytical and numerical tools to analyze laminar
              mixing of inhomogeneous fluids, and testing these  against experiments on
              well-characterized fluids.  The microstructure at any point in the fluid is
              represented by the area tensor, which provides information about the size,
              shape, and orientation of the microstructure.  The area tensor changes over
              time in response to the local deformation and rotation of the fluid, following
              a theory is incorporated into a finite element code, which solves
              simultaneously for pressure, velocity, and the components of the area tensor.
              Using this approach, engineers will be able to analyze the mixing performance
              of twin screw extruders and similar devices, which generate complex flow
              fields.  This capability will improve the design and operation of polymer
              mixing equipment, enable reliable scale-up of the laboratory processes, and
              improve the quality and consistency of polymer blends and related products.
