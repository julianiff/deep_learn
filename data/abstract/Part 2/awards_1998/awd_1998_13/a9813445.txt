Abstract    :
              The Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources is one of the NSF/ATE Centers of
              Excellence.  The Center is a collaborative effort of partners from Oregon,
              Washington, and Northern California including high schools, community colleges,
              four-year colleges and universities, private industries, government agencies,
              and Native American tribes.  Its mission is to improve curriculum and produce
              national models for high school and technical natural resource and
              environmental science programs as well as provide an information network for
              the region and the nation.    The Center is developing natural resource
              technology programs which incorporate higher levels of mathematics and science,
              using an ecosystems-based approach which emphasizes sustainable methods for
              resource use.  Key objectives for the Center include:    (a)  Curriculum
              development and dissemination by five "lead site" colleges and six "test site"
              colleges with natural resource-based associate degree programs.    (b)  Faculty
              and teacher enhancement institutes which are field- and laboratory-based for
              teachers from all levels of education around the country, faculty tours of
              world-class research sites, amd other professional development activities.   
              (c)  Promotion and dissemination activities including presentations at key
              national and regional conferences and symposia, promotional products including
              a videotape and a report entitled "Visions for Natural Resource Education and
              Ecosystem Science for the 21st Century, and development of an electronic
              clearinghouse.    The Center which was established in 1995 for three years is
              being renewed for an additional three years to maintain and enhance Center
              activities.
