The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) would like to
              continue science education reform and move from the elementary to the middle
              schools (grades 6-9).  The five-year project will be implemented in close
              partnership with the University of California, San Francisco, Berkeley, San
              Francisco State University, City College, the California Academy of Science,
              the Stanford Genome Center and the Exploratorium.  

The project will involve
              all 300 grade 6-9 teachers in the system in a phased-in process.  All teachers
              will attend a series of summer institutes, beginning with 40 teachers who will
              become the District science leadership teachers.  They will become leaders both
              at their school sites and as institute facilitators in subsequent years.

The
              curriculum will be Prime Science, supplemented with units from other
              standards-based materials (Event-Based Science, e.g.).  A preliminary
              curriculum implementation plan has been submitted.  The implementation plan
              focuses on a replacement unit strategy that builds over time.

In addition,
              the project will provide a teacher induction component, developed by the
              Exploratorium.  SFUSD participated in a pilot version of this program last
              year. This component will work with both novice and non-credentialed science
              teachers.  In addition to summer programs, intensive peer support through a
              mentor program will be implemented.
