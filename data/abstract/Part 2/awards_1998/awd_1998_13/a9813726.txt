This proposal focuses on the synthesis, structural
              characterization, and measurement of the properties of ternary compounds
              My'M6X8 containing discrete clusters of metal atoms where M' is a cation, M is
              either Ta, W or Nb  and X is either S, Se, Te.  The synthesis of these new
              compounds will be approached using modulated elemental reactants where the
              challenge will be in controlling  nucleation of the amorphous reaction
              intermediates.  Several potential approaches to seed or otherwise favor
              nucleation of the desired compounds are proposed.  The few known examples of
              compounds with similar structures all have unusual properties which are thought
              to be a consequence of their cluster based structure.  These correlations will
              be explored.

The inability to prepare new compounds with desired
              structures, compositions, and properties has long limited research in solid
              state chemistry and, as a result,  the advancement of  materials science and
              engineering.  Modulated elemental reactants previously developed will provide
              control of  reaction pathways to yield kinetically stable compounds with
              unusual properties that will enhance the availability of device materials of
              possible commercial interest.
