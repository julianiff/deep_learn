Abstract    :
              
This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program
              sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              Steven Cramer at RPI.  The proposed research concerns the study of a technique
              called preparative ion-exchange chromatography to efficientlu purify proteins. 
              The objectives are to develop a protein adsorption model based upon
              experimental adsorption data and the use of this model tooptimize system
              performance.  The proposed research suggests various approaches for advancing
              the state of knowledge in this area and encompasses a good blend of theoretical
              studies experimental work and modeling of the data.
