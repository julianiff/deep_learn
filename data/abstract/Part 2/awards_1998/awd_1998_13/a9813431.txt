Abstract    :
              IBN-9813431  LAY Abstract  Greenspan    Innate behavior, such as courtship in
              the fruit fly,  Drosophila melanogaster, is subject to a high degree  of
              genetic control. But some aspects of it are also  modifiable through learning.
              What a male fly learns  during courtship is not to waste his time on a female 
              who has already mated and who will consequently not be  receptive to him. An
              enzyme in nerve cells known as  the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
              (CaM  kinase II) is thought to play an important role in  learning and memory.
              The Investigators have developed  techniques to alter the activity of this
              enzyme in  vivo and will carry out studies to define what parts  of the brain
              are involved in this example of learned  behavior.
