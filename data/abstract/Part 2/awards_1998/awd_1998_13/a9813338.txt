This grant will provide funds to edit and publish an annual
              review of the student biomedical engineering design projects supported by the
              Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities program at NSF.  There are presently
              over 25 institutions participating in this program.  The eighth edition is
              being completed and this grant will support the publication of an additional
              five volumes over the next five years.  The work not only provides a catalog of
              rehabilitation device projects for use by the rehabilitation community but it
              is also being used as resource material in engineering design courses.  An
              electronic edition of the publication is available in URL
              <http://nsf-pad.bme.uconn.edu>.
