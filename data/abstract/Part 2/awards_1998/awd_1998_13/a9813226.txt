This research explores the possibility of assessing
              non-invasively, the
evolution of the structural changes in contaminated soils
              of different
composition.  The hypothesis is that structural changes result
              from changes
in the size of inter-particle spacing, and compositional changes
              result
from ionic or solution replacement in the spacing.  These changes
              result in
modification of hydraulic conductivity and porosity.  Knowledge
              about such
changes in contaminated soils is important and needs to be
              assessed
non-invasively if proper measures are to be taken to implement
              storage or
remediation of contaminants.

The investigation will involve
              laboratory measurements of the spectral
electrical response of contaminated
              soils integrated with theoretical and
equivalent circuit models of the
              soil-contaminant system.  Studies of the
electrical properties will provide
              information on the pore geometry and
pore surface area as both transport of
              free charge carriers in the pore
space and polarization at the pore-grain
              interfaces contribute to the total
conductivity.  The experimental study
              involves soil-contaminant mixtures of
varying ratios of clay, silt and sand,
              mixed with pore fluids that will
include organic and inorganic chemicals
              (acids and bases) and petroleum
products (e.g., kerosene).  Soil mixtures will
              be allowed to interact over
time and the frequency-dependent electrical
              response will be measured.  An
inversion method using a nonlinear optimization
              scheme, simulated
annealing, will be employed to retrieve the electrical and
              physico-chemical
parameters of the soil system over time.
