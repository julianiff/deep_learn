Phycists bring a unique perspective to education
              research.  Recently, more and more physics departments are creating
              tenure-track positions for faculty whose primary research interest is in
              physics education.  This research is task specific and consists of an
              integrated approach to examining student difficulties and designing
              instructional strategies and materials to address these difficulties.  As a
              researcher in this field, the P.I. proposes on-site visits to work with the
              directors of two NSF sponsored education research and development projects. 
              The objectives of these visits are twofold: (1) become more cognizant of
              current practices in the field of science education and (2) to develop a
              theoretical framework, based in current theories on learning and teaching,
              which supports the P. I.'s research.
