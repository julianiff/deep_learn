Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. James S. Nowick of the Department of Chemistry of the
              University of California at Irvine.   The research aims to extend earlier work
              on artificial protein structures by: 1) preparing larger oligourea scaffolds
              that hold four or more peptide strands together and cause b-sheet formation, 2)
              including longer (penta- and hepta-) peptides in the strands, 3) creating
              larger b-sheet structures, 4) incorporating hairpin nucleators that will permit
              antiparallel sheet formation, and 5) creating b-sheet sandwiches using a new
              type of template that will position two b-sheets in a face-to-face orientation.
                The work will also develop improved molecular modeling parameters, and extend
              b-sheet structure formation from chloroform to water solutions.

The proposed
              research involves the design and synthesis of protein mimics formed by joining
              peptides (short sequences of linked aminoacids) into controlled structures by
              the use of molecular scaffolds.   It will improve our understanding of how
              proteins fold, and could lead to the synthesis of new materials and artificial
              enzymes capable of carrying out desired reactions.   The students involved in
              the work will develop skills in the areas of protein synthesis and
              characterization, and will learn how to develop chemical systems in a logical,
              stepwise manner.
