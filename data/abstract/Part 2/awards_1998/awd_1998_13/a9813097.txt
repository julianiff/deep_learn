Abstract    :
              9813097  Willemain   The bootstrap is a method of computational inference that
              creates pseudodata called bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement from
              the historical data.  This research will use the bootstrap to convert one
              historical input series into many similar samples, thus allowing the use of
              independent replications for output analysis.   The investigation will include
              both the moving blocks bootstrap, which is the standard bootstrap variant for
              time series data, and a new alternative, the threshold bootstrap, that seems
              well-adapted to the demands of indirect inference.   This approach is referred
              to as indirect inference because the bootstrap is not applied directly to the
              output series but instead is applied directly via the input series.  
              Traditional direct inference focuses on the properties of estimators derived
              from bootstrap samples (e.g., unbiasedness, consistency), whereas indirect
              inference focuses on the properties of the samples themselves.  In this regard,
              the most important quality of the bootstrap samples is that they be
              functionally indistinguishable from independent samples of the same stochastic
              process.   If successful, one benefit of this research would be expanding the
              number of available inputs to trace-driven simulations, which achieve realism
              by driving system models with actual historical input series.  Another benefit
              would be the automatic generation of lifelike scenarios for risk assessment in
              financial planning and for training human operators in complex decision making
              tasks.
