Shaevitz
A broad program of research in elementary particle physics
              and an associated education and outreach program is proposed by a research
              group of the Columbia University Physics Department at Columbia's Nevis
              Laboratory.  Their program includes: the ATLAS detector construction project,
              which will be at the energy frontier at CERN's Large Hadron Collider; the D0
              collaboration that shared in the discovery of the top quark at the Fermilab
              proton-antiproton collider; the ZEUS collaboration that is investigating the
              form factors of nucleons using the electron-proton collider at the DESY
              laboratory in Hamburg, Germany; the NuTeV experiment at Fermilab, that explores
              the proton in a complementary way by using neutrinos; and the proposed
              MiniBoone experiment at Fermilab, that will better measure reported neutrino
              masses.
