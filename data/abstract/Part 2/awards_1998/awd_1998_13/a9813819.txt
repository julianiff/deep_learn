The PIs propose to study the light emission processes and
              develop novel light emitting devices based on the ZnO/GaN system.  Our
              preliminary studies indicate that ZnO films grown epitaxially on GaN on
              Sapphire by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), are of high crystalline and optical
              quality.  The quality of the films is such that the excitonic luminescence
              intensity produced is four to five times higher than that seen in the best
              quality GaN layers [1].  Furthermore, reports indicate [2] that ZnO has higher
              optical gain (300 cm-') than GaN (100 cm-') at room temperature (RT), and
              higher exciton binding energy (60 meV versus 28 meV for GaN)[3], thus
              suggesting a strong potential for ZnO to become a more efficient room
              temperature UV-blue light emitter than GaN.  Our proposal seeks to understand
              and improve the optical capabilities of this material system, and develop
              prototype light emitting devices.  Our work will include:
(a) the PLD growth
              of multilayered structures, the study, modeling, and simulation of the growth
              processes for improved film and interface quality, 
(b) the investigation of
              the light emission processes (radiative/non-radiative recombination,
              spontaneous/stimulated emission) with respect to the structural
              (defects/strain), electronic (impurity incorporation/field effects), and
              optical properties of the grown films, and 
(c) the design and fabrication of
              prototype UV-blue light emitting devices and test structures, ranging in sizes
              from microns down to nanoscale dimensions using both photolithographic
              techniques and focused ion beam (FIB) technology.
