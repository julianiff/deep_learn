              Kavazanjian, GeoSyntec Consultants    The objective of this project is to
              collect important data on the seismic   response of municipal solid waste and
              on ground improvement to enhance   liquefaction resistance through
              densification of sand by blasting. A unique   opportunity exists to achieve
              these objectives simultaneously through shear   wave velocity measurements
              during a blast-induced ground improvement pilot   program at the Oakridge
              Sanitary Landfill in Dorchester County, South   Carolina.    Shear wave
              velocity in the solid waste is measured by monitoring ground   motions induced
              by the test blasts, while shear wave velocity of the   improved ground is
              measured before and after blasting using crosshole and   downhole testing.
              These shear wave velocity measurements on the solid waste   and in the ground
              before and after blasting will provide valuable insight   into the dynamic
              behavior of these materials, and may identify important   phenomenon that merit
              further investigation.    Information on the shear wave velocity of municipal
              solid waste is limited   to data obtained in southern California landfills, yet
              it is the basis for   evaluation of the seismic response of landfills
              throughout the United   States. Solid waste shear wave velocities at the
              relatively wet Oakridge   Landfill that differ from those at arid southern
              California landfills would   provide evidence of regional differences in waste
              properties. These   potential differences could have a major impact on the
              seismic design of   landfills outside of southern California.    Recent data
              from a dynamic-consolidation ground-improvement project show   that the induced
              densification was overestimated using conventional   penetration  testing due
              to increases in lateral stress. Shear wave velocity   measurements before and
              after blasting can provide an important check on   the validity of cone
              penetrometer resistance as a measure of improvement,   and may provide a more
              immediate and cost-effective means of verifying   improvement, and can provide
              important insights into the mechanisms of   improvement.
