This award supports a National Science Foundation Dissertation
              Enhancement award to Dr. Hayley Shen of Clarkson University.  Dr. Shen's Ph.D.
              student, Mr. Gregory Leonard, will work for three months in the laboratory of
              Professor Motoyoshi Ikeda of the Graduate School of Environmental Earth
              Science, Hokkaido University, Japan.  The research project will investigate
              wind and wave effects on sea ice.

The proposed research will compare
              remotely sensed and field data obtained from the Okhotsk Sea to model studies
              in order to determine the effects of wind and waves on the motion and
              growth/decay of sea ice in the study region.  This project will provide access
              to the considerable Japanese field data from the Okhotsk Sea, thus facilitating
              interpretation of remote sensing results and providing input to the theoretical
              models.  The project will add new information to our understanding of sea ice
              dynamics and, at the same time, encourage stronger U.S.-Japan collaboration in
              this area of research.
