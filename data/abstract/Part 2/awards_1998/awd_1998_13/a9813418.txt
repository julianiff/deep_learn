This U.S.-Australia cooperative research project will
              survey the tephritid fruit flies of four Pacific archipelagos and conduct a
              phylogenetically based biogeographic analysis of the Pacific tephritid fruit
              flies.  The analysis will consist of determining which species represent the
              same adaptive radiation and which species represent independent colonization;
              reconstructing the historical relationships among species for those genera that
              contain three or more species; and, for single species, assessing the status of
              differentiated populations and tracing the colonization histories of these
              species.  Support is included for a junior investigator, Dr. XNeil Davies, to
              play a substantial role in the collaboration.  The Australian counterpart is
              Dr. David Yeates of the Department of Entomology, University of Queensland.
