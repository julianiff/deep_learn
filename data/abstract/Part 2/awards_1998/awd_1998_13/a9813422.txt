Kolata
This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. James Kolata from the
              University of Notre Dame in a research collaboration with Dr. Eli Aguilera of
              the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ) in Mexico City.  The
              researchers intend to engage in a multi-year collaborative experimental program
              to investigate the interactions of short-lived, radioactive nuclear species,
              with applications to nuclear structure physics and to nuclear
              astrophysics.
The experiments will utilize high quality, low-energy
              radioactive beams recently developed at the University of Notre Dame, in
              collaboration with a group at the University of Michigan, and will address
              important physics questions related to the structures of "exotic" nuclei at the
              edge of the valley of stability, as well as issues that are important for a
              complete understating of neutrino emission from the sun.
