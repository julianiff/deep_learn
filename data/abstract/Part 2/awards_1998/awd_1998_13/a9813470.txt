Abstract    :
              The World Banks Economic Development Institute in collaboration with the 
              National Science Foundation and the Center for Children and Technology will be 
              hosting two collaborative workshops for educators from the United States  and 
              Latin America.   Teachers and administrators from Latin American countries 
              have been participating in the World Links for Development Program (WorLD)
              linking  students and teachers with participants from other countries that have
              successfully implemented telecommunications projects. These anchor workshops
              will be an opportunity to:    * work with experts in the field to understand
              the context for their work, the kinds of teaching practices that have thus far
              proved most effective, and problem solving techniques; gain in-depth knowledge
              of the kinds of projects and pedagogical practices that they could implement
              when teachers return to their schools in the fall;    * plan for collaborative
              working among secondary school teachers from the US  and Latin American
              countries, and identify specific planning for teacher-partnerships for the
              school year;    * consider questions of context and culture, how the projects
              may need to be refined to take this into account, and how it might affect
              telecommunications-enhance learning.    Upon return to the schools, teachers
              will implement collaborative projects they have chosen and refined with
              cross-national partners at the workshops. Data will be collected through the
              research component of the project to probe the process of implementation,
              problems that may arise, effects of participation on teachers and students and
              cultural factors that may affect implementation.
