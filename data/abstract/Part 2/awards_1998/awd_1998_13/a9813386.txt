An internal-variable formalism is developed for a new
              family of inelastic models that are capable of representing the super-elastic
              transformations as well as the fully coupled thermo-mechanical phase
              transformarion is Shape Memory Alloys. These models can show different material
              response in tension and compression, and can account fof th
              single-variant-martensite reorientation prcess. The constitutive models are
              extended to the finite deformation regime by employing a multiplicative split
              of the deformation gradient. The issue of change in symmetry group because of
              the multiple natural configurations in SMA's is addressed. An unconditionally
              stable algorithm is develloped to solve the completed coupled thermo-mechanical
              system arising is SMA's. Technical issues related to numerical integration of
              the constitutive equations via the return mapping schemes, and the form of
              algorithmically consistent tangents needed to achieve higher order convergence
              are addressed in detail.***
