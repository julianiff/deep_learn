Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9813499  Keith E. Gubbins/N. C. St. U.    Partial support is
              provided for chemical engineering participants Liblice Conference on the
              Statistical Mechanics of Liquids, to be held at Zelena Ruda, Czech Republic on
              June 7-12, 1998.  The Czech Academy of Sciences is organizing and hosting the
              conference, and will cover all local costs within the Czech Republic.  Unique
              features of the conference will include:  (a) coverage of the most recent
              molecular methods and results for complex liquids and interfaces, including
              ionic and associated liquids, colloids and micellar solutions, self-assembly,
              aqueous solutions, surfactants and adsorbents, glasses, polymers, phase
              equilibria, and confined nanofluids, (b) latest developments in advanced
              molecular simulation techniques, including parallel and distributed systems,
              (c) coverage of both applied and basic aspects, and (d) an opportunity for U.
              S. researchers to become familiar with leading research in this area by groups
              from East and West Europe, Japan and Australia.  The invited speakers will
              include many of the international experts from these counties.  Previous
              conferences were held in 1983, 1986, 1990 and 1994.  ***
