Abstract    :
              This proposal deals with the effects of carbon dioxide buildup in the production
              of proteins by mammalian cells.  CO2, an oxidation by-product, is known to
              inhibit cell growth and probably to alter important glycosylation patterns. 
              The impact of CO2 on culture parameters such as rates, clycosylation,
              apoptosis, etc., and its interaction with other process variables such as pH,
              osmolality, and ammonia concentration, will be determined.  Two CHO cell lines
              will be used and the impact on three proteins, tPA, IFN-gamma, and a neural
              cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) will be studied.  A mechanism for growth
              inhibition by CO2 will be sought.
