This Americas Program award will fund a dissertation
              enhancement grant for  Mr. Nigel Pitman, under the direction of Dr. John
              Terborgh, Duke University, for a study on large-scale tree species
              distributions and habitat associations in Amazonia.  They plan a multi-scale
              inventory of a very diverse forest in Amazonian Ecuador, designed for
              comparison to existing inventory data  from a less diverse forest in Amazonian
              Peru. The two sites are roughly equivalent in soils, elevation, and rainfall,
              though the climate at the Peruvian site is more seasonal while the Ecuadorean
              site is significantly richer in  tree species.  The goal of this project is to
              generate enough information about diversity of  tropical forests to  determine
              why tropical forests close to the equator are more diverse than those
              elsewhere,  and whether individuals of a species are associated with a single
              forest type to a higher degree than would be expected under a random
              distribution. Data from  plots in which taxonomic identifications have been
              standardized will be used for the analyses.   
 
The project will provide
              estimates of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity for two of the richest plant
              communities ever studied.  It will provide new large-scale tests of ideas about
              how tropical tree communities function. It will also provide basic information
              about the abundance and distribution of hundreds of individual tree species 
              that will be of immediate use to the conservationists and managers charged with
              preserving these fast-disappearing ecosystems.  .
