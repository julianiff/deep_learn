Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science
              Foundation, supports participation of a  researcher from the University of
              Maine in an expedition of the  Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) to
              study beryllium  enriched minerals in Enderby Land.  Beryllium is a rare
              element  in crustal rocks and enrichments are especially unusual in 
              granulite-facies (high temperature and pressure, and relatively  dry
              conditions) metamorphic rocks. This project focuses on unique 
              beryllium-enriched pegmatites in the Archean ultra-high  temperature (up to
              1000 degrees C) granulite-facies Napier  Complex in eastern Casey Bay, Enderby
              Land, East Antarctica. The  primary objective is to test the hypothesis that
              the beryllium  originated in the metasediments hosting the pegmatites rather 
              than being a component of a pegmatitic magma.  Field work will be  conducted
              during the 1998/99 austral field season in Enderby Land  as a part of the
              Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition's project  entitled "Structure and
              Evolution of East Antarctic Lithosphere".  Mineral and rock compositions will
              be used to determine the  evolution and conditions of crystallization of the
              pegmatites and  their host rocks. The results of the project will provide some 
              important insights on the geochemical behavior of beryllium under  the high
              temperatures and low water activities characteristic of  the granulite facies.
