Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9813302  MULLER    The University of California-Berkeley
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators is
              becoming a multi-university I/UCRC with the addition of the University of
              California-Davis.  The Berkeley research site addresses micro components on
              sensing, movable structures and circuits and the mechanical properties of
              materials for micro components.  Meeting the announcement  for competitive
              research requirements and NSF Announcement 97-164, the Davis research site is
              expanding the Center's research agenda with significantly new intellectual
              substance through its research focus in micro-optical systems (microphotonics).
                  The research agenda of the new site will address:    1. Micromachined
              Fiber-Optic Switchers  2. Evanescently Coupled Microphotonic Devices and
              Systems  3. Femtosecond-Laser-Pulse Shaping  4. Silicon Field-Emitter Arrays 
              5. High-Precision Integrated Optical Scanners  6. Studies of Optomechanical
              Effects in Polymeric Thin Films
