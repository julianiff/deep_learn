This award will support twelve US participants (senior
              scientists, postdoctoral researchers) in a US-UK Workshop on Hamiltonian
              Mechanics and Small Divisors in Partial Differential Equations to be held at
              the International Center for Mathematics in Edinburgh, Scotland, May 23-June 4,
              1999.  Walter Craig of Brown University is organizing this workshop in
              conjunction with C. E. Wayne of Boston University, J. Carr, S. Kuksin and K.
              Khanin of Heriot-Watt University.  The Engineering and Physical Sciences
              Research Council of the UK will support travel costs and local expenses of
              20-25 UK and European mathematicians. 

Over the last five years there have
              been major developments in the analytic techniques of Hamiltonian mechanics,
              and their applications to partial differential equations (PDE) and other
              infinite dimensional dynamical systems.  The workshop focuses on the recent
              developments in (1) Hamiltonian dynamics and theory for PDE; (2) infinite
              dimensional Birkhoff normal forms analysis; (3) invariant Gibbs measures for
              PDE; (4) symplectic capacity in infinite dimensional phase space; and (5)
              Nekhoroshev's theory of metastability of multiply period orbits.  The workshop
              will provide the opportunity for the principal contributors to the field to
              develop new collaborations and will be a venue for training young researchers
              in the subject.
