The goal of this proposed research is to test a novel
              approach to transdermal drug delivery involving the use of standard
              microfabrication techniques to etch arrays of micron-size needles into silicon.
               The design of microneedles, which painlessly permeabilize the skin, is based
              on an understanding of skin anatomy.  Microneedles, which penetrate the skin a
              little more than 10-15 microns, should provide transport pathways across the
              stratum corneum, but do so painlessly since the microneedles do not reach the
              nerves found in deeper tissue.  To adapt this technilogy for transdermal drug
              delivery, the investigator proposes creating three-dimensional arrays of
              sharp-tipped microneedles on the order of 100 microns in length.  Because the
              skin surface is not flat, the full length of these microneedles will not
              penetrate the skin.  The microfabrication technique can be modified to make
              longer or shorter needles as required for painless delivery.
