Abstract    :
              Abstract - Graves      Partial support is provided for the 1998 Gordon
              Conference on Plasma Processing Science to be held August 9-14 in Tilton, NH. 
              This will be used to assist younger attendees without support of their own to
              attend.  The meeting is concerned with recent advances in the fundamental
              science of plasmas in the context of industrial processes.  Topics to be
              covered include real-time control of plasma processes, particles in plasmas,
              environmental engineering, molecular-beam surface experiments, plasma display
              technology, etching of dielectrics, plasma modeling, and new applications.
