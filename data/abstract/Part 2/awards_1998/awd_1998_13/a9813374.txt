Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Florida is planning to host a
              NSF/CBMS Regional Conference on "Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Related
              Topics" during June 8-12, 1999.  The specific objectives of the conference are
              to generate interest in this topic among faculty and graduate students at the
              University of Florida and neighboring universities, and to promote
              collaboration among regional researchers in the future. Professor Charles
              McCulloch of Cornell University has committed to deliver 10 lectures at the
              conference and
to write a monograph that summarizes the current
              state-of-the-art of the research and applications of generalized linear mixed
              models.  The conference will involve approximately 30 invited participants,
              mostly
from universities in the south eastern states.
