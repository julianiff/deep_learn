Abstract    :
              The Cold Spring Harbor Consortium, consisting of laboratories based in Cold
              Spring Harbor Laboratories, Washington University and Perkin-Elmer ABI
              Corporation, will continue to sequence the genome of Arabidopsis thalania with
              the goal of contributing to the completion of the entire sequence by the end of
              the year, 2000 AD. At a projected cost of $0.50 per base pair, 2.4 million
              bases will be sequenced in 1999, initially on chromosomes IV and V, as agreed
              by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, the oversight group which coordinates
              this sequencing effort. If necessary, in order to reach the goal of 2.4 Mbs,
              other regions will be sequenced in accordance with decisions jointly reached by
              AGI and the CSH Consortium. Such joint decisions will determine the sequencing
              activities for this Consortium in the future years of this award. Additionally,
              all information relating to the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana, if
              not otherwise prohibited, will be made available to the community and other
              Arabidopsis sequencing groups in a timely fashion.  An informatics person will
              be dedicated to the task of supplying the Arabidopsis community with such
              information in an interactive, user-friendly mode.
