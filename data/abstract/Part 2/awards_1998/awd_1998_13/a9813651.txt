Abstract    :
              9813651 William J. Mitsch This is an award for support of international travel
              by 6  persons who will participate in the SCOPE (Scientific Committee on
              Problems of the Environment) Workshop on Ecological Engineering Applied to
              River and Wetland Restoration to be held in Paris, France from July 29-31,
              1998.  This is the third of three workshops planned by the SCOPE Committee on
              Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration.  The prior workshop held in
              Estonia in 1995 addressed restoration of ecosystems damaged by air pollution,
              soil and water contamination.  The 1996 workshop that was held in China dealt
              with the integration of agricultural production, fertilizer production and
              pollution control.  Participants for whom support is provided by this award
              will contribute to workshop sessions on river and stream restoration, wetland
              uses for pollution control and coastal restoration.  

Results of this award
              are expected to contribute toward identification of research needs associated
              with the application of ecological principles in restoration of damaged
              ecosystems.  Support for this award is being jointly provided by the
              Environmental Engineering and Environmental Technology elements of the
              Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in the Division of Bioengineering and
              Environmental Systems and by the Ecosystems Studies Program in the Division of
              Environmental Biology.
