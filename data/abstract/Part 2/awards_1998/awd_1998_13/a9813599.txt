The objective of this research is to expand on the investigators
              earlier discovery of "avalanching" in airway opening during
              inspiration/ventilation.  The investigator discovered that an airway will open
              when the inflation pressure exceeds the critical opening threshold pressure. 
              The random spatial distribution of the critical opening threshold pressure
              causes multiple airway openings for a given increase in airway pressure. This
              essentially causes the avalanche effect.  This research seeks to: (1) continue
              to study heterogeneity of structure and function in airway opening, (2) to
              study dynamics of lung sounds, and (3) develop improved variable ventilation
              strategies for mechanical ventilation based on a stochastic resonance
              model.
