Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification
              program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations program of
              the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              Douglas Frey at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  The proposed
              research concerns the study of techniques to efficiently purify proteins
              without exposing them to pH ranges where they might denature or precipitate. 
              These methods are often referred to as buffer focusing chromatography or
              chromatofocusing.  They are not currently used on a large scale because of a
              lack of understanding amongst practitioners about how retained pH gradients,
              having a high buffering capacity, can be formed at low ionic strenghts using
              low cost buffering species.  The proposed research suggests various approaches
              for advancing the state of knowledge in this area and encompasses a good blend
              of theoretical studies, experimental work and modeling of the data.
