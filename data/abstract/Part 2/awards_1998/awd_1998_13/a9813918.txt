Abstract    :
              9813918  Hu    This U.S.-Mexico award will provide partial funding for a 
              workshop on the renormalization group to be held in Taxco,  Mexico, January
              1015, 1999.  The organizers are Bei-Lok Hu  of the University of Maryland,
              College Park, for the United  States, and C. R. Stephens and Alberto Robledo
              Nieto of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and  Riccardo
              Capovilla and Denjoe O'Conner of the Center for  Advanced Studies of the
              National Polytechnic Institute  (CINVESTAV) for Mexico.      The
              renormalization group is one of the most powerful tools  of theoretical
              physics.  It has been applied successfully to  many fields, including
              statistical and particle physics,  applied mathematics, and fluid dynamics. 
              The workshop will  bring together researchers and students to chart out new 
              directions for the future development of the renormalization  group approach
              and to stimulate academic interchange and  collaborative research between the
              U.S. and Mexico,  especially at the postgraduate level.      ***
