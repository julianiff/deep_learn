              Abstract  ATM-9813463  Busacca, Alan J.  Washington State University  Title:
              Conference Support: Dust Aerosols, Loess Soils, and Global Change; Seattle,
              Washington; October 11-13, 1998    This award is for the partial support of
              organizing and conducting an international conference on "Dust Aerosols, Loess
              Soils, and Global Change" in the northwestern United States in October, 1998. 
              The goal is to bring together agricultural/environmental scientists with
              geologists and others to explore connections between past geologic-climatic
              cycles of dust transport and deposition and the environmental problems of soil
              erosion that accompanies human uses of the resulting loess soils today. 
              Significant new research is underway in the different disciplines; the
              conference will provide a forum for scientists with common interests to meet
              one another and share ideas and research strategies.
