Abstract    :
               This research will examine state level variations in the adoption, scope, and
              coverage of state building safety regulations and the factors that determine
              that variation.  The study will address two critical issues: the factors that
              account for variations in state adoption of building code regulations and what
              can be done to foster state adoption of hazard mitigation provisions of
              building code regulations.  Answers to the following questions will be sought:
              What is the impact of information provision strategies by federal agencies,
              model organizations and policy networks on state policy choices?  How do these
              exogenous factors relate to various sociopolitical and economic contextual
              factors at the state level.  A national, comparative analysis of all fifty
              states will be conducted, supplemented by case studies of four states: Florida,
              Texas, Oregon, and Idaho.  Data will be collected from secondary sources and
              from state officials, agencies, key stakeholder groups, and regional
              associations involved in regulation.  A survey of state officials will also be
              conducted.
