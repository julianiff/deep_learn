              ATM 9813774

The investigators will continue measurements of mesospheric winds
              using a medium frequency (MF) radar on Kauai, Hawaii.  The data will be used to
              study the interannual, seasonal, and short-term variability of the waves and
              mean winds at equatorial and subtropical latitudes.  The MF radar technique is
              ideally suited for continuous measurements of the mean, tidal, and planetary
              wave structures, but it has also proven valuable in statistical and mechanistic
              studies of gravity wave modulation, seasonal and short-term variability, source
              sensitivity, and propagation character at mesospheric altitudes.  Specific
              science objectives include 1) definition of the zonal mean circulation, 2) a
              more complete definition of the structure and variability of tides, 3) a better
              understanding of planetary wave structures, and 4) studies of gravity wave
              propagation, source responses, and filtering.  The effort requires an upgrade
              to the Hawaii radar consisting of a new 12-bit receiver system and improved
              analysis software.  When combined with other comparably upgraded systems at
              Christmas Island, Rarotonga, and other latitudes, the data will contribute
              significantly to understanding of mesosphere and lower thermosphere dynamics
              and its implications for global atmospheric structure
