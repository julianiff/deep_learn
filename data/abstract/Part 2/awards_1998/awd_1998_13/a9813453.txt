	The coupled relationships among various aspects of ablative
              laser micromachining processes will be modeled, numerically explored, and
              experimentally validated.   A transient three-dimensional model embracing
              coupled equations for heat transfer and phase change in solid material,
              evaporation and gas dynamics associated with a Knudsen layer, and effects of
              plasma will be developed.  A control-volume based finite-difference algorithm
              with power-law scheme will be used for the solid/liquid and plasma regions
              while an integral method will be used to solve for jump conditions in the
              Knudsen layer.  The model will predict machined geometry, energy transport,
              recoil momentum, plasma flow, particle ejection, and debris formation.
	More
              precise knowledge and improved prediction capabilities will result from the
              research.  This will help meet the need arisen from the trend towards smaller
              spatial and temporal scales in laser micromachining.  The project will also
              provide valuable insights into future development of quantitative prediction
              capabilities in other regimes of the field.
