Abstract    :
              The International Conference on Multiagent Systems, being held July 4-7, 1998 in
              Paris, has as its purpose bringing together researchers in the important area
              of agent-based software design, a major factor in the successful exploitation
              of the World Wide Web, digital libraries, and electronic communities, among
              other applications.  This grant will provide travel funds for representation of
              American research, including some graduate students, at the conference and its
              related workshops collectively called "Agents World".
