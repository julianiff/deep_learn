Abstract    :
                        The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will
              research, write, publish, and distribute a book of in-depth profiles on 30
              high-achieving undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities who are
              pursuing coursework in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
              (SMET). The students to be profiled will be selected from those who
              participated in the "ENTRY POINT!" program of summer internships in 1996, 1997,
              and 1998.  (ENTRY POINT!  is a collaborative effort of AAAS, private industry
              and federal agencies.)  Historically, students with disabilities have been
              discouraged from pursuing education and careers in SMET fields.  Too often, it
              is assumed that a student who has a significant disability would not consider
              aspiring to a scientific career.  Judging from the students whom AAAS
              identified, recruited, screened, and placed in the internships, this is not the
              case.  These students met high criteria such as demonstrated high motivation,
              persistence, and academic achievement.  The focus of the study and resulting
              publication will be the critical factors that directed and kept these students
              in the SMET pipeline (e.g., mentors at every level, role models with and
              without disabilities, precollege and postsecondary faculty, moral and financial
              support from families, counseling, legislation, assistive technology, and
              funding sources) and their views on barriers and solutions.  The resulting
              publication, Roadmaps and Roadways, will be widely distributed to leaders in
              education and employment fields.
