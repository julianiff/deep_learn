Abstract    :
              Reichman et al.    98 13668    The 1997-1998 El Ni o (ENSO) event has caused
              extremely high rains throughout central coastal California and these have
              generated a large number of landslides.  These landslides change the shape of
              the landscape and its vegetational characteristics. The distribution of these
              landslides appears to be related to a specific combination of physical and
              biological factors.  Slope, parent material and soil water content influence
              the probability of slumping and mudslides as do the rooting characteristics of
              vegetation and animal activities.  This project would investigate the
              distribution of landslide events to examine the importance of these biotic
              factors and the mechanisms by which they operate.    On the Sedgwick Reserve in
              the University of California Natural Reserve system near Santa Barbara, it has
              been observed that hillslopes with the same geometry and parent materials
              appear to exhibit different probabilities of slumping due to the vegetation
              that occurs on them.  Specifically, it appears that areas with coastal sage
              scrub communities are much more likely to exhibit slides than are grasslands
              that surround them.  This project will document this phenomenon and examine the
              factors that may be causing it.  In particular, it will examine differences in
              root density and the incidence of understory vegetation as potential causal
              factors driving landslides.  It will also test whether gophers, which are not
              common in sage-scrub areas, increase the drainage of water from grasslands
              through their development of burrows.  This project will contribute to an
              understanding of biotic influences on landscape hydrology and provide important
              information for the development of conservation strategies for this region of
              California.
