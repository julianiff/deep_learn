This US-Mexico collaborative research proposal between Dr.
              Jean-Claude Diels, the University of New Mexico, and Dr. Nooshin Jamasbi,
              CICESE Fisica Aplicada, Optica, is a three-year study of new techniques for
              measurement of ultrashort laser pulses. The project aims to replace existing
              methods of measuring ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses, which are all based on
              some optical nonlinearity, by methods using a broadband optical detector. In
              addition to the collaborators, one graduate student will be involved in the
              collaboration.  

The project will expand the experience of the U.S.
              researchers by providing a Mexican facility and personnel capable of performing
              optical tasks leading to the full characterization of femtosecond signals,
              while the Center of High Technology at the University of New Mexico will
              provide equipment required to develop the electronic nonlinear detector arrays
              applicable to the work. This mutual exchange of technical and resource
              strengths will lead to increased awareness of the capabilities of both
              institutions, lead to future joint endeavors, and widen the choices available
              to students.
