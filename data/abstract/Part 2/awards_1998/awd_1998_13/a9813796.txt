This U.S.-Mexico Award will leverage funding from a National
              Institutes of Health-supported Minority International Research Training Program
              award to San Diego State University for the purpose of providing international
              research experiences for underrepresented students.  NSF support is aimed at
              expanding the currently supported ethnobotanical/pharmacological research in
              Mexico to include the development of plant databases and chemical
              characterization of plants being collected.
NSF support will be used to fund
              three students for two months of ethnobotanical research under the supervision
              of Prof. Robert Pozos and Dr. E. Bejar from San Diego State University and
              Mexican researchers at the National Institute of Anthropology and History
              (INAH) in Morelos and the National Autonomous University (UNAM) in Mexico City.
               One student will conduct ethnoanalyses of plants collected in Guerrero,
              Mexico; the other two will isolate and pharmacologically evaluate isoflavonoids
              from Jicama plants and conduct plant classification studies at UNAM in Mexico
              City.  At the end of the research experience, students will be required to
              write a scientific report and present results of their research to other
              students on campus.
