Abstract    :
                    9813960  Johnson  The Fourth International Conference on Stochastic
              Structural  Dynamics will be held at the University of Notre Dame on August 
              6-8, 1998.  The Conference will bring together researchers and  engineers
              involved in stochastic mechanics, random vibration,  stochastic processes,
              structural reliability, stochastic control,  and related fields throughout the
              world.  Abstracts for over 100  papers have been submitted for inclusion in the
              conference from  some 20 countries.    The design and analysis of virtually
              every engineering structure  must account, explicitly or not, for the
              stochastic nature of  environmental forces generated by earthquakes, ocean
              waves, and  wind gusts, of man-made forces produced by people, machines,  etc.,
              and of variations in material properties and manufacturing  processes.  The
              mitigation of the hazards these forces cause is  of prime importance.  This
              conference will provide a forum for  researchers to discuss the state-of-the
              art in stochastic  structural dynamics and identify key areas for needed future
               research.    This project provides support to help defray some of the 
              participation costs for young researchers, for distinguished  honored
              participants, and for publishing a proceedings of the  conference.  ***
