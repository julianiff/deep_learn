Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT       
EEC-9813307 
Varner/Alfred Univ 

This is an Exploratory
              Research Project to augment the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              
for Glass Research.

The objectives are to understand the concept of
              brittleness in non-metallic, glassy systems, and to determine the
              compositional/structural parameters that make certain glasses less brittle. 
              Various indexes will be studied to determine which tests provide the best
              measure of brittleness.  Success will lead to more effective use of glass in
              areas where strength is a critical design parameter
