Abstract    :
                The Sixth International Conference on Biophysics and  Synchrotron Radiation
              will be held at the Advanced Photon  Source, Argonne National Laboratory, from
              August 4-8, 1998.  The conference will feature invited talks, extensive poster 
              sessions, juried "Hot Topics" talks by students and  postdocs, informal "Meet
              the Experts" sessions, and a tour  of the APS. Scientific topics include
              macromolecular  crystallography, with a particular emphasis on the 
              applications of synchrotron-based crystallography to  problems in cell biology;
              X-ray scattering from non  crystalline systems such as solutions, fibers and
              membranes;  spectroscopies ranging from the hard X-ray to the UV and IR 
              regions of the spectrum; microscopies; medical imaging;  apparatus and
              experimental techniques; and the impact of  synchrotron radiation on biophysics
              (past, present and  future). These fields have been expanding very briskly, in 
              response both to earlier scientific successes and to the  availability of the
              new, thirdgeneration synchrotron sources  at the European Synchrotron Radiation
              Facility in Grenoble,  France, the Advanced Photon Source itself, and the
              SPring 8  facility under construction in Japan. The expansion is also  fueled
              by strong industrial interest, principally from the  pharmaceutical and
              biotechnology industries. The conference  is likely to attract up to 650
              participants, ranging from  beginning graduate students to Nobel Laureates.
