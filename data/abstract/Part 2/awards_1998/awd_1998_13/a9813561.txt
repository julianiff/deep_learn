Abstract    :
              This award will support graduate student participation in the 2nd SIGMETRICS
              Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Tools, to be held on August 3-4. 1998 at
              Welches, OR and is the successor to the biannual parallel debugging workshop. 
              This  premier symposium on parallel tools typically brings together the top
              researchers from around the world.  Being a small conference, graduate students
              have many opportunities to meet informally and interact with leaders in the
              field.  The workshop traditionally puts out a document that summarizes both the
              papers presented and the discussion they evoked.  The graduate student
              recipients of these travel grants will produce the web document, each reporting
              on one of the sessions.
