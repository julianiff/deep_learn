The next generation of large, high resolution optical astronomy
              facilities will require order-of-magnitude advances in optical angular
              resolution.  Conventional concepts would maintain the needed precision by use
              of motion and position sensors and electromechanical actuators (that impose
              forces or moments directly on the optical support structure) coordinated by
              complex feedback control laws implemented via a digital signal processor. 
              To-date, the development path that is being contemplated for the
              next-generation systems would proceed by incrementally refining the
              conventional concepts, along fairly well defined but practically very costly
              stages.
In contrast the present study explores an unconventional combination
              of (1) new nonlinear optics devices for wave-front correction, (2) optical
              signal processing and (3) neural network technology for optical control to
              obviate many of the high-cost engineering difficulties of ultrahigh resolution
              optics.  In essence it will try to enable the design of a system that uses a
              (potentially large) number of independent separate apertures (each one
              relatively small and rigid) that combine their optical information to emulate a
              very large aperture device but that do this without using extremely precise
              relative positioning and alignment among the several subapetures.  The benefits
              to astronomical knowledge from such facilities could include submilliarsec
              measurement of stellar diameter, resolution of close and interacting binaries,
              precise measurement of galactic and cosmic distance scales and detection of
              extra-solar planets.
