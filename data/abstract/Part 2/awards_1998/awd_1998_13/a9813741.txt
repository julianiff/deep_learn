This is a 15 month award proposed by Drs. Tawei Soong and Ben
              Yen of the University of Illinois, and Professor Wang Zhaoyin of International
              Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation of Chinese Academy of
              Science.  The P.I.s request funds for 11 U.S. scientists to travel to Beijing,
              China to attend a joint workshop on sediment transport and sediment induced
              disasters in March , 1999.  The workshop is aimed at gaining insights into the
              mechanisms of river sedimentation, disasters and control strategies and will
              explore effective approaches for scientists in both countries to exchange
              knowledge and experience, to meet their research and education needs, and to
              initiate future cooperation in this field.  This project is jointly supported
              by the National Science Foundation of China and the NSF.
