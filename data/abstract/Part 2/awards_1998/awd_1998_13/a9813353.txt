Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support of a workshop whose  objectives are to assess
              current methods of measuring and  modeling glacier mass balance, highlight
              application of new  technologies and approaches, and encourage investigations
              in  difficult but common glacial environments.  Although there  have been a
              number of symposia examining these relations,  the methods for mass balance
              measurements and modeling have  been largely ignored.  The mass balance of
              glaciers and ice  sheets are receiving renewed interest because of the 
              relationship between climate change and the effect of  glacier wastage on
              sea-level.  This award will provide  funding to enable publication of the
              workshop proceedings.
