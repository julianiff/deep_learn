Abstract    :
              DMI-9813757  Jawahir  An international workshop on modeling of machining
              operations, sponsored by CIRP (The International Institution on Production
              Engineering Research), is to be held in Atlanta, Georgia on May 19, 1998. The
              workshop will provide a forum for academic and industry experts in machining to
              present the latest research results on modeling of machining operations and to
              discuss research needs and critical research issues for the future. Funds are
              requested to pay for the travel of three invited keynote speakers, to assist
              the travel of eight junior faculty members and post-docs, and to support the
              publication of the workshop proceedings.  The workshop has a good mix of
              invited speeches, paper presentations, and discussion sessions. The
              identification of the future research needs and issues will be valuable to the
              research community and NSF.
