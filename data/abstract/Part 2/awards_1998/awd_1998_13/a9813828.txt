Abstract    :
              ATM9813828

The investigators will study arctic summer phenomena, specifically
              noctilucent clouds (NLC) and gravity wave and tidal propagation through the
              middle atmosphere.  The work involves an extension of the lidar capability at
              Sondrestrom, Greenland, into daytime operations by implementing a liquid
              crystal double etalon system..  The researchers will investigate the following
              questions:  (1)  What are the local time and seasonal dependencies of the
              behavior and characteristics of NLCs, (2)  What is the impact of gravity waves
              and tides on the formation and lifetime of NLCs, and (3)  Are there
              longitudinal differences in NLC observations?  The daytime lidar capability
              will enable the gravity wave influences on NLCs to be more thoroughly analyzed,
              as well as the tidal influences on the basic characteristics of the clouds. 
              Recent studies suggest that continued increases in tropospheric methane should
              result in an increase in mesospheric water vapor concentrations leading to more
              frequent NCL occurrence, particularly at lower latitudes.  The gravity wave
              influences on this occurrence must be fully understood to assess the role of
              anthropogenic changes.
