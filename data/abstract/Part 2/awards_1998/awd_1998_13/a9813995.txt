              The brain and nervous systems of all animals, including our own, can  be 
              greatly altered by various types of neuroactive substances. This  is a familiar
              concept if one thinks of the effects of 'street' drugs  on  the  brain,  or 
              the  way one feels in response  to  a  jolt  of  adrenaline.  Both  adrenaline
              and serotonin are  known  as  biogenic  amines.  But, how do brain chemicals
              work to regulate the production  of  a  particular mood or behavior? What
              causes specific nerve cells  to  release  their  chemicals  for  the 
              production  of  appropriate  behavior, and what are the neural targets for such
              chemicals? At the  level  of  individual nerve cells, answers to such questions
               remain  far  from complete. The aim of this proposal is to understand better 
              how the biogenic amines work to regulate nervous system function and 
              ultimately  the generation of behavior. A simple invertebrate  model  nervous 
              system  has been chosen for study because individual  nerve  cells (neurons)
              can be readily studied, especially ones that contain  either  serotonin or the
              adrenaline-like compound called octopamine.  The  electrical  activity  of
              amine-containing  neurons,  and  their  connections  with target nerve cells
              can be followed  in  much  more  detail  than  is  currently possible using
              more  complex  vertebrate  systems.  One  important component of this research
              is  based  on  a  recent  finding  in  Dr. Mesce's lab where it  was  found 
              that  the  combination  of  two  biogenic amines can result  in  behaviors  not
               induced  by  either  substance alone. Because  the  actions  of  the  biogenic
               amines  are  fairly conserved  across  species,  including  humans,  such 
              studies  will contribute to an understanding  of  how  single and multiple
              neural chemicals can orchestrate the release  of  various   kinds   of 
              behaviors  ranging  from  the   activation   or  inactivation  of locomotion,
              alteration in motivational  state,  and  possibly, behavioral disorders in
              humans.
