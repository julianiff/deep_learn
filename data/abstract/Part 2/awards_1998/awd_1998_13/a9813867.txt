              ATM9813867

This proposal will support the post-doctoral research of Dr.
              Steven Smith at Boston University's Center for Space Physics.  The research
              will use the Boston University CEDAR Optical Tomography Imaging Facility
              (COTIF) to study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT).  COTIF is a
              four-site network in New England consisting of an all-sky  imager at Millstone
              Hill and three imaging spectrographs (two in Maine and one in Rhode Island),
              the only optical facility worldwide capable of ground-based atmospheric
              emission tomography.  This project will take advantage of a new spacing
              configuration for detecting structure in the 80 to 150 km domain.  The study
              will make use of existing as well as new data.  Specific emphasis will be
              placed on studying the altitude variations of acoustic gravity waves.  The data
              analysis will yield estimates of the vertical momentum flux of gravity waves at
              two altitudes.  The divergence of the vertical flux gives the acceleration or
              deceleration of the mean wind field by interactions between the neutral winds
              and waves.  Long term seasonal and local time variations in gravity waves will
              also be investigated
