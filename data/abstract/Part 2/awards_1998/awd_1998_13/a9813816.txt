Abstract    :
                Abstract    Grant Number: CTS 98-13816    Principal Investigator: Banerjee    
              This is a grant to partially  support participation of  graduate students and
              young scholars in the First International Symposium on Turbulence and Shear
              Flow Phenomena (TSFP) which is to be held in Santa Barbara in September, 1999. 
              There are several objectives to this program, including a continuation of the
              tradition established by a previous series of very successful symposia on
              Turbulent Shear Flows (TSF) which began in 1977 and ran every other year
              through the 11 th meeting in 1997.  The TSF series focused on turbulence
              fundamentals, turbulence modeling and applications of models to industrial
              flows, direct and large eddy simulations with applications, building block
              flows such as wakes and mixing layers, particle-laden flows, and compressible
              and variable density flows. The Santa Barbara symposium is the will continue to
              emphasize these objectives.  It is also intended to significantly broaden the
              scope of the new TSFP symposia series to reflect the increasing range of
              technological applications and environmental processes in which turbulence and
              shear flow phenomena play a key role.  These areas would include the fluid
              mechanics of multiphase systems, biological and biomedical systems,
              environmental fluid mechanics, and flow control and MEMS.
