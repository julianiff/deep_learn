The objective of this proposal is to extend the operating
              frequency of a low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system being donated
              to the investigator by General Electric Medical Systems.  This requires the
              acquisition of radio frequency (RF) components to extend the operating
              frequency to cover the 2-10 MHz range.  This may enable the hyperpolarized
              noble gas MRI, recently invented by the investigator and his collaborators, to
              be used for the imaging and spectroscopy of human body structures and functions
              that have hitherto posed difficulties for conventional proton MR.  The
              potential applications include:  (1) lung and lung-gas imaging (for diagnosis
              of emphysema and studies of respiratory function), (2) the imaging of lipid
              structures in the brain (for the diagnosis and staging of multiple sclerosis
              and in research on brain function), and 3) better measurement of blood flow to
              tissue (important for stroke and ischemia diagnosis, and also for research in
              brain and cardiopulmonary function).
