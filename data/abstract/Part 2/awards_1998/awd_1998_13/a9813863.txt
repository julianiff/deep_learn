The investigators will perform numerical modeling of the upper
              atmosphere using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
              thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIEGCM). 
              The major science focus is to quantify the role of electric fields and neutral
              winds in low latitude electrodynamics.  This addresses one of the most
              fundamental question in thermospheric/ionospheric research:  what is the
              relative importance of electric fields and neutral winds in determining the
              ionospheric densities, drifts, and structure?  The question is particularly
              difficult because of the complex interaction between the neutral and ionized
              gases, involving much feedback and mutual adjustment.  The TIEGCM is one of
              only three models worldwide that treat the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere
              system self-consistently.  The investigators will use the TIEGCM to simulate
              the ionosphere and thermosphere for different seasons and five levels of solar
              activity.  The model output consists of electric fields, conductivities, and
              neutral winds.  A parametric study will be conducted to assess the relative
              importance of E region propagating tides and F region winds to the
              electrodynamics.  Validation studies will be conducted using data from radars
              and optical instruments in Puerto Rico and Peru.  The model results will be
              archived and made available to the scientific community
