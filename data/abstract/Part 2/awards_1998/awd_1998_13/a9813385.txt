Abstract    :
              Austin  9813385  The Third Symposium on Biological physics will bring together
              both leaders and beginning scientists to the interface between physics and
              biology.  The goal is to stimulate interaction among physicists and biologists,
              who wish to probe both the applications that physics has to biology, and what
              biology can teach about the physics of complex systems.   The Symposium will be
              unified in the emphasis on the interplay between biology and physics, and in
              the close interactions among experiment, theory and computation.  A wide
              spectrum of topics, ranging from nucleic acids to proteins to cell membranes,
              networks and cells, will be covered.  This International meeting is jointly
              supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Directorate for the
              Biological Sciences and the Office of Multi-Disciplinary Activities in the
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
