Mehregany
A total of $10,000 is requested from NSF to assist a number
              of graduate students who are engaged in Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
              research to travel to the Solid State Sensors and Actuators Workshop, which is
              to be held in Hilton Head, SC from June 7-11, 1998.  This NSF travel support
              will augment similar travel support funding in the amount of $15,000 from
              Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA).  In addition, the Workshop's
              sponsoring organization, Transducers Research Foundation (TRF), will contribute
              similar travel support.

The presence of the graduate students who conduct
              much of the academic research in the field is of immense importance to their
              educational experience and the quality of the Workshop.  For many of these
              graduate students, attendance at the professional conferences constitutes a
              major part of their education.

An announcement in response to the Workshop
              paper submission acceptances and registration applications has been made to
              notify US participants of the availability of the travel support.  A member
              serving on the program committee will select the candidates for travel and
              subsistence assistance awards.  In order to stretch the available funds,
              consideration of partial travel grants will be made.  The requested support
              will only be available to those graduate students from US academic
              institutions.
