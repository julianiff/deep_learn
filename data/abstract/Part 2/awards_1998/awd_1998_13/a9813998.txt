Abstract    :
              This small SGER proposal seeks to explore the use of electroporation to release
              extracellular bioproducts for recovery from bioprocessing.  This is the reverse
              of the normal process which permits small biomolecules to be introduced into
              cells.  Saccharomycees cerevisiae will be electrically pulsed and the amount of
              the enzyme, invertase, will be measured as well as the selectivity of release. 
              The yield and ease of processing will be compared to conventional, cell
              disruption methods.
