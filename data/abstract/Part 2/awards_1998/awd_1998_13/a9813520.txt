	There are many interesting mathematical problems that are
              motivated by a desire to understand the workings of various biological systems.
              In order to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research, a workshop on
              "Mathematical Problems in Biology" will be held at the Fields Institute for
              Research in Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, Canada from June 14 to 24, 1999, as
              part of a special year long program on Probability and its Applications.
              Eighteen prominent biologists, mathematical biologists, and mathematicians, all
              of whom are talented expositors, will give two one-hour lectures to an audience
              of mostly young (postdoctoral) researchers. This award will allow fifteen US
              postdoctoral researchers to participate and train themselves for research in
              these exciting and important areas.
