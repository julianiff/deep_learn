Abstract    :
              9813098  Dzenis    This proposal is to conduct a comprehensive experimental and
              theoretical study of the electrospinning of polymer nanofibers by a splaying of
              a charged jet as a mechanism to produce nanofibers. The intent is to improve
              fundamental understanding of the splaying process so that it can be controlled
              and used for various industrial applications. Modeling of the steady state
              motion of the dielectric and conductive jets will be continued, with Newtonian
              and non-Newtonian viscous polymer fluids considered. An electrohydrodynamic
              model of splaying will be developed based on stability analysis of the
              steady-sate solution for a single jet.    The self-replicating splaying jet
              will be described by the multiple application of the model at consecutively
              decreasing scales. Experimental verification of the existence of a
              supercritical regime will be attempted. Since splaying is unique for the
              electrospinning of polymers, it provides a mechanism that produces polymer
              nanofibers in a short distance, as opposed to a mere stretching of a single
              jet. High volumes of these nanofibers can be produced in this manner. There is
              collaboration with the biomedical materials industry and with NIST.
