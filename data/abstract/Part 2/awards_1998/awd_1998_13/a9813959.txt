Abstract    :
              9813959  Walsh  The objective of this research is to add to the scientific basis
              of laser welding by using absorptive dyes through a sequence of theoretical and
              experimental studies.  These studies will involve optimization of a nmber of
              laser, dye, cooling, and tissue parameters.  The main goals of this research
              are to:  (1) develop a Monte Carlo based model of optical transport with a
              computational heat transfer model in order to explore the full range of welding
              parameters that can be varied and guide the proposed experimental work, (2)
              conduct a series of experiments that more fully explores the range of welding
              parameters available, (3) develop an interactive cooling system to increase
              weld strength, decrease surface thermal damage, decrease operative time, and
              potentially decrease operative and post-operative pain, (4) explore several
              vital dyes of use in tissue engineering, (5) understand the advantages and
              disadvantages of several dye delivery systems, and (6) explore the welding of
              tissues other than skin.
