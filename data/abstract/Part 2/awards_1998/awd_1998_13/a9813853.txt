The investigators will study topside ionospheric dynamics,
              composition, and temperature using observations from two incoherent scatter
              radars and two satellites from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
              (DMSP).  The ability to combine date from the two sources provides the
              opportunity to identify and quantify the influences of F-region neutral winds,
              and plasma drifts on the topside ionosphere composition, temperature, and
              velocity.  The data will be interpreted with the aid of a model that calculates
              the distributions of ionospheric constituents, their temperatures, and
              velocities along magnetic field lines.  Winds in the F region modulate the
              location and density of the ionization layer, which in turn affects the
              distribution of plasma partial pressures resulting in field-aligned ion flows. 
              The ion flows transport heat and produce adiabatic heating and cooling in the
              topside ionosphere due to  the changing magnetic flux volume.  The objective is
              to establish the observed relationships between F-region dynamics and topside
              ionospheric composition and temperature
