This is a 36-month award proposed by Dr. John Bowers,
              University of California, collaborating with Dr. Chi-Kuang Sun, National Taiwan
              University.  Dr. Bowers requests funds for travel and supplies to carry out a
              cooperative project with his counterpart at the National Taiwan University. 
              The objectives of the proposed project are (1) to design and fabricate
              high-bandwidth communication wavelength traveling-wave photo-detectors, (2) to
              set up a high-bandwidth Electro-optic sampling device operating in
              communication system,  and  (3) to investigate transport dynamics, saturation
              non-linearities, and distributed  traveling-wave effects in this
              ultra-high-speed photo-detector.  The researchers are highly respected in this
              field.   This proposal is well organized and has  strong technical merits. 
              This is a cutting edging project, and the  result of this project may provide a
              breakthrough for long-haul-type communication systems and could have far
              reaching impacts in high speed communication.  It also provides an excellent
              opportunity for training a graduate student to learn how to develop and test
              such ultra-high-speed photo-detectors.
