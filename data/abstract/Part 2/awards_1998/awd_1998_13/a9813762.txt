Abstract    :
              9813762  Andorfer    The Maryland Science Center is planning a nationwide,
              traveling exhibit that would examine the scientific investigations and findings
              related to how and why the Titanic sank.  During this planning phase for the
              project, two of the Maryland Science Center staff would participate in an
              upcoming scientific expedition to study the Titanic.   They will be able to
              closely follow the work of the Marine Forensics Panel of the Society of Naval
              Architects and Marine Engineers in order to understand more thoroughly the
              scientific processes and principles involved.   The museum staff also will
              refine the design of the exhibit and test prototype exhibit components, themes,
              styles, and presentation of science.
