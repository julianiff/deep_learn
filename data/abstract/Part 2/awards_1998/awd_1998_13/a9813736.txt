This is a 12-month award proposed by Drs. Hung-Tao Shen and
              Hayley Shen, Clarkson University.  They request funds for a planning visit to
              China to hold discussions with counterpart scientists at the China National
              Marine Environmental Forecast Center, State Ocean Administration, and Beijing
              University in order to develop a cooperative research proposal on air-sea-ice
              interaction using the Bohai Sea as a field laboratory, and to establish an REU
              site to provide undergraduate students from the Great Lakes Research Consortium
              Institutions an opportunity to conduct sea ice field studies in China.  This
              project addresses one  major INT  focus area:  contributing to human resource
              development.
