Abstract    :
              9813022  McMeeking  The microelectromechanics of perovskite ferroelectric 
              ceramics (PFC) and single crystals is investigated. Simple  experiments are
              conducted to study the swithcing response of  polycrystalline and single
              crystal PFCs in the presence of  simulataneous electric field and mechanical
              stress. Models  for nonlinear behavior of PFC combined with the experimental 
              data are used to develop phenomenological constitutive laws  to predict the
              response of polycrystalline ceramics and  single crystals. A fracture mechanics
              approach for PFCs is  also developed.  ***
