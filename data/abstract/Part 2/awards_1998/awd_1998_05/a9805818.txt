Abstract    :
              9805818  Marchetti  This research activity spans a range of topics in
              statistical and  condensed matter physics, focusing on materials properties
              that  are determined by the interplay of quenched randomness,  interactions,
              and thermal fluctuations. Three directions of  inquiry are planned:
              nonequilibrium phases of periodic media  driven through disorder, with the
              broad goal of developing a  theoretical framework for the description of these
              nonequilibrium  systems and mapping out their phase diagrams; properties of 
              vortices interacting with artificial pinning structures in  type-II
              superconductors--experimentally relevant questions will  be addressed; the role
              of linear vacancies and interstitial  defects in line crystals, particularly
              the Abrikosov flux-line  crystal in superconductors. %%%  This is a Visiting
              Professorship grant made under the  Professional Opportunities for Women in
              Research and Education  (POWRE) program. The research will contribute new
              materials  science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature of 
              the program is the integration of research and education.
