Although tensile fracture has been well understood for
              more than 50 years, shear fracture remains poorly understood, especially in
              terms of the nucleation process.  The details of the self-organization process
              by which a population of microcracks evolves into a localized fault, and the
              factors controlling fault orientation remain poorly understood.  With the
              discovery of high-pressure phase-transformation-induced faulting, there are now
              two mechanisms of shear failure available for study.  Although the fundamental
              physics of the two mechanisms is different on the finest scale, the evidence
              suggests that on the scale of self-organization and faulting, the mechanisms
              behave similarly.  Comparison of these two mechanisms can lead to new insights
              and potentially one can be used to resolve unanswered questions involving the
              other.  In particular, the diagnostic appearance of the transformed material in
              microlenses makes the attempt to decipher the self-organization process much
              simpler than attempting to distinguish cracks of many generations in material
              faulted by "brittle" processes.  This study will examine the approach to
              failure in Mg2GeO4 undergoing the olivine« spinel transformation at pressures
              greater than 2.5 GPa (pressures too high for "brittle" processes to
              participate) to map out the microstructural evolution from loading-generated
              microlenses, through the self-organization process, to faulting.
