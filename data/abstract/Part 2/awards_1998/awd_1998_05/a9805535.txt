The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC)
              Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems serves the national interest by
              providing, as a result of requests from sponsoring agencies, or on its own
              initiative, evaluations and advice concerning ocean developments and uses and
              the nation's ability to meet its marine and maritime goals.  The Board
              considers questions of the relation of engineering and technology to coastal
              and offshore resource development and operations; to navigation and the
              commerce of the sea, waterways, and ports; to related human resources and
              onshore activities; and their relation to the establishment and implementation
              of public policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new
              technologies and other developments and recommends appropriate actions.  It
              stimulates the exchange of information and cooperative activities, and provides
              a forum for the national and international professional community.

The
              activities through which the Board accomplishes its programs are: (1)
              assessments of the technical capability to undertake and manage offshore and
              maritime developments and uses, including the adequacy of knowledge to support
              technology development; (2) evaluations of safety of personnel and of the
              environment; (3) assistance in the preparation and assessment of the
              government's program directed to ocean and maritime developments and uses; and
              (4) identification of future opportunities for the integration of advanced
              technology into marine and maritime systems and the influence of technical
              advances on the establishment and implementation of public policy.
