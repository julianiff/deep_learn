Abstract    :
              9805007  Wells   The problem of the relationship between the foreland and the
              crystalline hinterland in mountains belts in general, and in the Sevier
              orogenic belt in particular is a significant and long standing problem.  This
              study focuses on rocks of the hinterland, and will employ a variety of
              techniques to extract information on the timing of loading and of exhumation of
              these high grade metamorphic rocks. The study will reveal the types of
              processes that occur in the lower crust of a hinterland, in particular, include
              the absolute dating of these processes.  The larger significance is that with
              this information, the events in the lower crust of the hinterland can be
              correlated in time with sedimentary events in the upper crust of the foreland.
