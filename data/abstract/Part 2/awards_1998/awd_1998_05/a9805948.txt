Abstract    :
              9805948  Bowen  The amount and pattern of differentiation among populations can
              result from many factors. A particularly important issue in the study of
              population structure in birds is the ways in which social systems and
              fine-scale demography affect population subdivision. Mexican Jays are an
              excellent subject for the study of genetic structure because of their unique
              social behavior and their geographic distribution. Their tendency to breed in
              or near their natal groups, their long lives, and their sedentary nature
              suggest that gene flow may be reduced relative to other species. The isolation
              of populations on sky islands at the northern end of the range could further
              reduce gene flow among those populations and may have resulted in found effects
              when they were first isolated. This POWRE research will use microsatellite
              markers to examine population structure in Mexican Jays. Four hypotheses will
              be tested: 1) isolated populations of Jays are genetically differentiated from
              one another; 2) populations of Jays from the core range in central Mexico will
              have less differentiation and higher levels of gene flow than isolated
              populations; 3) measures of genetic structure and genetic distance developed
              for microsatellites will provide useful descriptions of genetic structure; and
              4) phylogenetic relationships among populations will be consistent with
              topologies obtained from allozyme and mitochondrial data.
