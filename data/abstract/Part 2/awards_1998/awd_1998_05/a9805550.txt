Abstract    :
              The basic driver for the magnetosphere is the solar wind (dynamic pressure and
              magnetic field).  However, it is becoming increasing clear that the nature of
              the driving mechanism is significantly altered by processes in the bow shock
              and magnetosheath.  Observational evidence from both satellites and
              ground-based instruments have shown this to be true, but surprisingly little
              theoretical/modeling work has been done on this subject.   The proposed
              research program will use three-dimensional MHD modeling and two-dimensional
              Hybrid modeling to address these problems.
