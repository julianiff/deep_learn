This research involves the analysis of broadband and
              short-period earthquake source characteristics of moderate to great
              earthquakes, and examining variations of source properties with depth, size,
              focal mechanism, and tectonic regime (e.g. slab thermal parameter).  First,
              current work will be continued on stacking broadband and short-period P waves
              of deep earthquakes recorded by the National Net and by short-period regional
              arrays to obtain time functions.  Second, this approach will be extended to the
              subset of moderate to large shallow earthquakes with moment and depth such that
              rupture terminates before the arrival of obscuring depth phases, that is,
              reflections from the Earth's surface above the earthquake.  The goal is to
              compare time histories of earthquakes from 30 to 650 km depth and enable the
              systematic characterization of shallow rupture termination, a process hidden in
              the depth phases of the most commonly studied large, shallow earthquakes.  This
              set of time functions will also characterize the transition from shallow to
              deep faulting, suggested by the drop in aftershock productivity as depth
              increases, as well as help constrain the mechanism of deep seismic
              faulting.
