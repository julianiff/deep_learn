This research deals with the study of the crustal and upper
              mantle structure along the young, seismically active Southern Alps in New
              Zealand in collaboration with the New Zealand Institute of Geological and
              Nuclear Sciences.  The project will test the question of whether young
              transpressional tectonic regimes require thickened lithospheric high
              seismic-velocity, high-density roots as part of their early development.  The
              main objectives are; 1) to obtain three-dimensional seismic images of
              subcrustal lithospheric heterogeneity beneath the Southern Alps, 2) to
              integrate the tomography images into the larger tectonic framework describing
              the development and evolution of the oblique subduction zone fault system, and
              3) to develop a general thermal-kinematic model of young orogeny.  This will be
              accomplished by teleseismic travel-time inversions of the 1995-1996 Southern
              Alps Passive Seismic Experiment data set combined with the New Zealand National
              Seismograph Network data set.  This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
