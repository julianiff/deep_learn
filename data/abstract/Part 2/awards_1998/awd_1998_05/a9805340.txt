Abstract    :
              9805340  Yin   The Tibetan plateau is one of several large areas of anomalously
              high elevation and is clearly related to collisional tectonics.  Yet the actual
              timing and mechanisms of uplift is unclear.  This project will examine whether
              or not old suture zones in the plateau have been reactivated, and if so, the
              timing and magnitude of the displacement.  Results should clarify the
              shortening history of the plateau that may be hidden or obscured by suture
              reactivation, this allowing a more robust understanding of plateau uplift in
              orogenic zones.
