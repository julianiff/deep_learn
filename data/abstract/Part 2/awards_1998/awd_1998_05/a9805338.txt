Abstract    :
              As multi-media traffic begins to dominate broadband networks,  accurate modeling
              of video and data traffic becomes crucial to many important  network
              applications. Video and data traffic has recently been found to  possess
              complicated self-similarity that invalidates previously developed traffic  
              models. One of the most important problem is how to develop computationally 
              efficient and yet accurate models which could capture the complicated 
              statistical properties of video and data traffic for network design/control.   
              Our objective of this research is to develop a unified model which is  (1) able
              to model heterogeneous multi-media traffic including VBR video and  data, (2)
              computationally efficient, and (3) feasible for analysis.    To accomplish our
              goal, we propose to use wavelets. We will show that  although heterogeneous
              multi-media traffic has the complicated short- and long-range  temporal
              dependence, the corresponding wavelet coefficients are no-longer  long-range
              dependent. Therefore, simple methods can be used to model   network traffic in
              the wavelet domain. In particular, independent wavelet   models have shown to
              be sufficiently accurate, parsimonious, and   have the lowest computational
              complexity attainable.    We will focus our efforts on investigating how to use
              independent   wavelet models for analysis including anto-correlation, and
              buffer loss  rate. We will also investigate how to apply wavelet models to
              network  control such as admission control.
