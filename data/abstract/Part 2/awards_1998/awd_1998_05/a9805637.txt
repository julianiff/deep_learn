Abstract    :
              9805637  Copeland   It is generally acknowledged that the arc-continental
              interactions along the western coast of South America has involved major
              crustal shortening that has both thickened the crust and raised the elevation
              of the land surface over the thickened crust and formed basins in the foreland
              position.  However, there are at least two periods of crustal thickening in
              Bolivia, and only the younger one has received documentation.  The older (late
              Cretaceous to mid tertiary) episode of thrusting and foreland basin evolution
              remains virtually undocumented, yet is required to assess total shortening and
              to understand the origin of the present topography and syn orogenic deposits. 
              This project will study these sediments in order to test two hypotheses for
              their origin.   The results are expected to test between these hypotheses and
              also allow for a rigorous comparison between the Andes and other retroarc
              fold-thrust belts, such as the North American Cordillera.
