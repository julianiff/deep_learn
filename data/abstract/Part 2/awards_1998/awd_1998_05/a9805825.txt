The two primary objectives of this project are to expand the
              principal investigator's (PI) methodological abilities and her researh
              liaisons, which will enhance her research a and applied work on students;
              reasoning and knowledge construction in science classrooms.  The PI will
              develop competency in using video data analysis technology by working with the
              researchers at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) who developed
              the techniques, then use the technology to analyze existing and forthcomning
              data on science learners; sociocognitive processes.  She also will establish
              substantive links to the research programs of social scientist at UCLA who
              develop large scale assessments of science teaching and learning.  In these
              ways, the PI will deepen and broaden her ability to make contributions to
              science education theory and practice.
