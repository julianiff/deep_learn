Abstract    :
              This project addresses methods for increasing the density and  robustness of
              data storage systems.  Specifically, it extends our  work on combined  maximum
              transition run (MTR) coding and signal  space detection to recording channels
              at very high densities and  to cope more efficiently with realistic noise and 
              nonlinearity encountered in such channels.  In particular, MTR  coding and
              other distance-enhancing code constraints will be  investigated for use in
              future high density recording channels.  Generalized signal space detection
              methods which will be used in  conjunction with the distance-enhancing codes
              will also be  studied. The proposed research tasks are: 1) performance analysis
               of MTR codes in the presence of medium noise and nonlinearity;  2) distance
              analysis and search for other distance-enhancing code  constraints
              incorporating the data-dependent nature of transition  noise and nonlinearity; 
              3) derivation of optimal hyperplanes  better suited to data-dependent noise and
              nonlinearity;  and 4)  finding generalized signal space partitioning methods in
              higher  dimensions to develop efficient constrained-delay detectors.
