Abstract    :
              Attachment instability refers to the process by which people's beliefs,
              feelings, and behaviors regarding security in relationships change over time.
              Some people experience a constant feeling of safety and security in close
              relationships, others experience a constant feeling of insecurity in
              relationships, and still others experience marked changes in feelings of
              security over time. The goal of this study is to identify who these latter
              people are and why their beliefs and feelings are so unstable. The study tests
              a series of competing hypotheses regarding the extent to which these people are
              (a) prone to such instability because of early deficits in the development of a
              positive, coherent sense of self or (b) prone to such deficits because of
              ongoing changing life circumstances, or (c) some combination of the two. The
              present study focuses especially on young people, with the goal of identifying
              those who may be at risk for developing chronic maladaptive interpersonal
              patterns that put them at continued risk for negative outcomes.
