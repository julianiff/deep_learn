Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of  
              California at Davis supports the research of Professor Matthew Augustine.   
              The theme of the research is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)   with
              optical spectroscopy to understand energy transfer problems on a   molecular
              level.  Limits on the feasibility of the technique as it is   extended to pulse
              mode will be examined on a simple solution of   benzophenone in acetonitrile. 
              The excited-state electron transfer in   energy storage materials such as
              organometallic complexes like divalent   (Ru(bpy)3)2+ will also be
              investigated.  The study of molecular energy-transfer and electron-transfer
              processes   such as are examined in this project is important for understanding
                photosynthesis, designing better optical sensing devices and  
              light-harvesting systems, and in the study of energy-storage materials
