One of the most important, and difficult to quantify, variables
              in orogenic (mountain-building) processes is time.  Whereas we can measure
              rates of tectonic processes directly in some active tectonic belts today, we
              have very few constraints on the rates of tectonic processes in the past.  The
              proposed research is designed to produce quantitative comparisons of the
              relative rates of metamorphism in metamorphic rocks from different tectonic
              environments.  Rates of metamorphism are directly related to rates of heating
              and rates of tectonic disturbances (e.g. rates of burial and exhumation), so
              quantification of metamorphic rates will lead directly to the ultimate goal of
              placing constraints on tectonic processes in ancient orogenic belts. Rates of
              metamorphism will be quantitatively constrained by detailed analysis of the
              rates of nucleation and growth of garnet from rocks of the garnet zone.  This
              will be accomplished through statistical methods, image analysis, thermodynamic
              analysis and kinetic modeling of garnet compositional zoning
