              on Computational                     Neuroscience:  Vision"                    
                           This short course meets from June 18 - July 1, 1998.  It 
              emphasizes that an understanding of the way computer-based  approaches can be
              combined with data on perceptual and  biological phenomena to help guide
              research in neuroscience.  Through a combination of lectures and hands-on
              computer  laboratory experience, the course covers:  neural image 
              representations; the neural basis of color vision, pattern  vision and visual
              motion perception; oculomotor (eye movement  and tracking) function; and visual
              attention.  It will  provide special emphasis on computer-based models of the 
              neural substrates of visually-guided behavior and decision-  making.
