This research proposes to investigate historical river
              discharge and dissolved solids records from the unique landform of the Colorado
              River Basin (CRB).  The purpose of study is to develop a detection and modeling
              strategy for large-scale basin response from low-frequency climate forcing
              (interannual and decadal time scales) and secular trends from natural and
              anthropogenic origin.  The characteristic terrain of the CRB, represented by
              the Colorado plateau in the upper basin and the Basin and Range physiography in
              the lower basin, serves to define the natural space and time scales of fluid
              and solute storage across the region; while landuse practices of irrigation and
              reservoir operation modify the natural and hydrochemical "signal).  An
              important question to be addressed is "what is the minimum state-space
              dimension of dissolved solids-discharge as a function of landuse, landform and
              hydrogeologic conditions, and how do they relate to long term climate forcing. 
              The data base is: 40-60 years of monthly average streamflow and stream
              chemistry for 20 stations distributed from the upper Green and Colorado rivers
              to the Gulf of California; monthly precipitation-temperature records across the
              basin and adjacent plateaus and ranges; groundwater levels in irrigated and
              nonirrigated regions as well as digital terrain and landuse data.
	Two methods
              for extracting space-time signal from noisy hydrochemical data will be used:
              principal component analysis for spatial modal analysis and, singular spectrum
              analysis for detection of temporal oscillations.  Our recent research published
              in Water Resources Research  (Duffy, 1996; Duffy and Cusumano, 1998; Shun and
              Duffy, 1998) has involved formulation of dynamical models from terrain
              averaging of hydrochemcial variables and underlying partial differential
              equations.  The study will form the basis for testing a practical,
              low-dimensional modeling strategy for the CRB which attempts to balance the
              degree of model complexity with a definable level of modeling skill, and to
              evaluate the effect of interannual and decadal climate oscillations on the
              water resources of the CRB.
