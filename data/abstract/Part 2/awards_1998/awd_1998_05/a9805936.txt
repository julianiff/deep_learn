The objective of this research is to develop algorithms for the
              study of biomechanical systems using bond graph techniques.  A set of
              standardized musculoskeletal modules will be developed to describe muscle
              spindle receptors, muscle crossbridge mechanisms, tendon organs, and other
              passive resistance and feedback control elements of the human body.  These
              modules would be combined to form models of musculoskeletal dynamics, in
              particular, for studies of balance and the mechanisms of recovery from
              perturbations in balance.  Model predictions will be compared with experimental
              data to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed techniques.  This research
              is appropriate for the POWRE program because it will permit the principal
              investigator to establish an independent research program which will further
              her career advancement.
