Abstract    :
              9805907  Wang  Deformed swept volumes are defined as the volumes swept by
              deforming objects undergoing general motions. Development of fast and accurate
              sweep generators, which can represent and analyze swept volumes generated by
              general three-dimensional objects undergoing general motions, has been an
              important research area in solid modeling and computer-aided design and
              manufacturing technology. Research on swept volume has potential for advancing
              existing manufacturing technologies, thereby resulting in an increase of
              manufacturing productivity, product quality and cost reduction. The objective
              of this POWRE project is to develop a new theoretical framework for the
              representation and analysis of deformed swept volumes. This analysis will
              greatly expand the range of application of the deformed swept volume approach
              to computer-aided design and manufacturing and will establish the P.I. as a
              significant contributor to this field. The recently developed sweep
              differential equation approach for rigid objects will be modified and used for
              the first time to represent, compute, and analyze the swept volumes of deformed
              3D objects. Advanced computer programming tools will be utilized to design
              graphical user interfaces and develop computer software for the visualization
              and integration with commercial software.   This technique will be used to
              construct modules used in the computer-aided design software and then applied
              to the computer-based dynamic NC (Numerically Controlled) simulation and
              verification. This work will be of interest and value to industry, once the
              fundamental issues are successfully addressed.
