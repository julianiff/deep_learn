Abstract    :
              9805563  Layton    This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research 
              project between Dr. William Layton, University of  Pittsburgh, and Dr. Nando L.
              Troyano DiBartolomeo,  Universidad de Oriente, Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela.  The 
              focus of the project is to develop increasingly  sophisticated electro-thermal
              cell models and finite element  codes for the simulation of aluminum reduction
              cells (ARC).  The increasing speed and storage capacity of massively  parallel
              computers and clusters will play an important role  in this effort, as will
              also improved algorithms in  (ARC)  computations.  The goal of the project is
              to develop and to  implement in computer codes state-of-the-art methods for 
              simulating the physics of ARC.  The program would provide a  needed research
              tool for efforts to increase the safety and  energy efficiency of aluminum
              production.   The updated  models and codes will be made available to
              university and  industrial experts in the field in the US and Venezuela.    The
              development of increasingly sophisticated electro-  thermal cell models and
              finite element codes for their  simulation should be of interest to major
              aluminum producing  countries such as the US and Venezuela.  Results of the
              best  runs of the research code as well as the code itself will be  made
              available to US and Venezuelan industrial research  groups.      ***
