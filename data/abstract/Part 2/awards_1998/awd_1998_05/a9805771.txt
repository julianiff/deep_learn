Abstract    :
              9805771  CHAPMAN   During development, different tissues and  organs require
              different numbers of cells.  Programmed cell death  (or "apoptosis"), along
              with cell division, is a primary way that  cell number is controlled. 
              Apoptosis occurs as a series of  cellular and biochemical events in which the
              cell, instead of  dividing, involutes, falls apart, and is engulfed.  Every
              normal  cell appears to have the "program" for cell death, which can be 
              activated in a number of ways.  The neurotrophin receptor gp75NTR  or NTR,
              expressed by neurons and some immune cells, is a member of  a family of
              cytokine and growth factor receptors known to regulate  many cellular decisions
              to undergo programmed cell death.  The NTR  contains an intracellular domain
              that is similar to the "death  domain" of other receptors that can initiate
              apoptosis, but it has  not yet been shown that the NTR's putative death domain
              functions  in apoptotic signaling.  The objective of Dr. Chapman's study are 
              to establish whether the NTR's death domain interacts with  elements of the
              apoptotic mechanism (caspases), and to demonstrate  whether this receptor can
              induce programmed cell death when  expressed ectopically in cultured mammalian
              cells.       This project is particular suitable for a POWRE award.  Dr. 
              Chapman recently made the unusual transition from the  biotechnology industry
              to take a faculty job at the new San Marcos  campus of the California State
              University system.  CSUSM  emphasized hands-on laboratory experience with
              modern technology  to prepare their students in the biological sciences for
              careers  as researchers, science teachers and in the biotechnology  industry. 
              Dr. Chapman brings real world experience to her  students, and will be able to
              actively engage them in research  with this POWRE award, which will provide the
              funding for her to  initiate this research project.
