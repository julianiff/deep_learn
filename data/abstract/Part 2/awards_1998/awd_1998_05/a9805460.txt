The PIs propose to conduct a range of high-pressure
              experimental studies designed to constrain the bonding, structures, elasticity
              and chemical compositions of a suite of materials relevant to both the Earth's
              volatile budget and subduction processes.  Specifically, they plan to focus on
              three distinct, but complementary topics: 1) the manner in which water is
              retained at high pressures in hydrous phases likely to predominate within
              subduction zones within the Earth's upper mantle; 2) continue studies of the
              densities of anhydrous high pressure phases of oceanic crust with a goal toward
              understanding how the density differences which drive the subduction process
              have evolved since the Archean, and 3) measure the equations of state of a
              range of iron alloys at high pressure (and following heating), with the primary
              focus being to constrain the pressure derivatives of their bulk modulus, a
              parameter which the PIs have shown to be virtually the only discriminant which
              provides a geophysical constraint on core chemistry.
