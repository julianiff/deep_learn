This continuing research program will provide new
              experimental data that bear on problems of mineral deposit exploration,
              volcanic hazards and volcanic inputs to the atmosphere. In this research
              endeavor, experiments will be performed on the partitioning of a number of
              elements, including Au (continuing ongoing melt-volatile studies), Fe, Co, Cu,
              Ni and Zn, between melt, brine and vapor at pressures near 100 MPa. For many of
              these elements no melt-volatile partitioning data exist; further, for others,
              their equilibria have not been investigated in the vapor + brine stability
              field and/or at lower pressures. Emphasis will be placed on the proper
              thermodynamic formulation of partitioning equilibria. Some of these experiments
              will be performed in the vapor-absent brine-melt field.  Overall these
              experiments are critical to our understanding of melt-vapor-brine equilibria in
              subvolcanic magmatic/hydrothermal ore-forming environments. Thus the
              experimental data will be used to further models designed to predict the
              composition of volcanic volatiles and to predict fluid inclusion compositions
              and ore metal inventories of mineral prospects.
