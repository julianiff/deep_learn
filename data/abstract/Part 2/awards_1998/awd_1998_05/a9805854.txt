Abstract    :
              Silverberg  9805854  The research is in the fields of Number Theory and
              Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry, with a focus on abelian varieties and Shimura
              varieties. The questions to be studied concern f-adic representations, adelic
              representations, ranks of elliptic curves, fields of definition, fields of
              moduli, and torsion points on abelian varieties.  Silverberg will use a POWRE
              grant to be a Visiting Professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
              This will contribute positively to her research, career advancement,
              visibility, and professional growth.  Abelian varieties and Shimura varieties
              are important mathematical objects which arise in a wide variety of areas, and
              were used in Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture and in Wiles' proof of
              the Semistable ShimuraTaniyama Conjecture. Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry is a
              subject that blends two of the oldest areas of Mathematics: Number Theory and
              Algebraic Geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful,
              having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among the many
              applications are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
              modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks. Number Theory and Algebraic
              Geometry have found numerous applications in data transmission and processing,
              communication systems, physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
