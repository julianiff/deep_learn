Abstract    :
              9805620  Cannon  This is an award, the objective of which is to obtain a better
              understanding than now exists of the nature of natural organic matter in water
              that eludes removal by conventional water treatment processes. 
              Characterization of this residual organic matter will be used to assist in
              design of processes for its removal.  The research being conducted in this
              project involves further development and application of a new method for
              determination of lignin in sea water involving use of tetramethyl ammonium
              hydroxide in a "thermochemolysis" reaction to analysis of water for natural
              organic substances.  This reaction produces methylated products, determinable
              by use of gas-chromatographic mass spectroscopy that provide insights into the
              structure of their parent organic substances.  This knowledge is likely to
              provide insights into how carbon used for removal of natural organic substances
              from water can be activated to improve its adsorptive properties for the target
              organic substances, removal of which will reduce or eliminate the formation of
              undesirable byproducts in water during its disinfection.  The proposal leading
              to this award was submitted under guidelines contained in NSF98-142 Grant
              Opportunities for Academic Liaison With Industry (GOALI).  The industrial
              partners in conduct of this project are the American Water Works Service
              Company, Inc. and Norit Americas, Inc.  Results of this project are expected to
              provide the fundamental knowledge needed for activation of carbons that will be
              more capable of selective adsorption of natural organic matter from water that
              is possible with currently available activated carbon. ***
