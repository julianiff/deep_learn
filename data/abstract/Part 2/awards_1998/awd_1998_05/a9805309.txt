This research will investigate the faulting mechanism of deep
              earthquakes, which remains a fundamental question in geophysics.  Recent
              studies, of which this is a continuation, have identified several interesting
              properties of deep earthquakes, including the large lateral extent of mainshock
              and aftershock faulting and the dependence of magnitude-frequency relations and
              aftershock productivity on slab temperature.  This work will systematically
              investigate the variability of fundamental rupture parameters for the largest
              deep earthquakes recorded by the IRIS, GDSN, and WWSSN global seismic networks.
               In addition, the work will explore the relationship between regions of high
              moment release and the locations of aftershocks and background seismicity.  The
              results will allow assessment of the extent to which slab temperature and
              background seismicity control deep earthquake rupture properties, and provide
              fundamental constraints for understanding the deep earthquake faulting process.
