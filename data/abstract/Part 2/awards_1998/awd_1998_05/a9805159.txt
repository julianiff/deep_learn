This project is a detailed study of the distribution, origin,
              and P-T-t history of eclogites and associated high grade rocks in the central
              Piedmont of South Carolina that will illuminate the role of pre-Alleghanian
              collisions in the evolution of the Carolina terrane, and provide insights into
              the formation and exhumation of high pressure rocks in other collisional
              orogens. Our work on these eclogites and their enclosing gneisses will include:
              (1) Detailed mapping (1:24,000) to determine the distribution of eclogite
              facies rocks and their enclosing gneisses in selected quadrangles; (2)
              Calculation of paleo P-T-t paths based on chemical zonations in the primary
              mineral phases, retrograde mineral compositions, and on mineral inclusions in
              garnet; search for possible ultra-high P mineral assemblages in the inclusion
              suites. Calculation of paleo P-T-t paths for the enclosing gneisses, and search
              for relict high P assemblages in the enclosing gneisses. (3) Determination the
              protoliths of the eclogites and their enclosing gneisses by whole rock major
              and trace element geochemistry, combined with their distribution and age
              relationships.
