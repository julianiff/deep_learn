Abstract    :
              9805585  Jacoby  This POWRE project will track the development of toxic
              cyanobacteria in Lake Sammamish, near Seattle, WA. Rapid residential
              development is occurring in the watershed of this lake. As forested wetlands
              are transformed to urban and suburban landscapes, nutrient inputs carried by
              storm water to the lake have increased and water quality has decreased. One of
              the symptoms of increased nutrient loading is increased abundance of nuisance
              species of phytoplankton, particularly bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Some
              species of cyanobacteria can produce toxins which further degrade water
              quality. The primary goal of this project is to identify the factors that
              promote the development of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. To do so, relationships
              between environmental factors and the development of toxic blooms. Initiation
              of these blooms will be investigated by monitoring the development and
              migration of Mycrocystis spp. through the water column coupled with
              measurements of environmental parameters and resource availability.
              Interactions between Microcystis and zooplankton will be determined, along with
              the importance of sediment-to-water column movement of Mycrocystis as an
              initial source for recruitment. This work will provide valuable information on
              the relationship between environmental degradation and toxic phytoplankton
              blooms in freshwater systems. Such information can be used to develop
              management options to reduce toxicity in these systems.
