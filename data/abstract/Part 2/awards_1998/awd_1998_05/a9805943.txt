Abstract    :
              Hoopes
9805943
The overall plan of this project is to prepare Laura L. Mays
              Hoopes, after 5 years as Vice President and Dean of the College at Pomona
              College, to join the Biology Department faculty at Pomona College.  She was
              appointed with tenure in the Biology Department, but as a full time
              administrator, has had little time to be involved in the teaching and research
              that a faculty member is expected to carry out.  The laboratory of Dr. Judith
              Campbell at California Institute of Technology is providing a place where Dr.
              Hoopes can develop a project concerning the DNA2 gene of Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae, including learning the techniques for studying DNA transactions in
              yeast.  In addition, it will be possible to audit Dr. Campbell's class and 
              attend numerous lectures on state-of-the-art molecular biology.  This project
              is particularly suited for a POWRE award because Dr. Hoopes will be returning
              to the laboratory and learning new techniques and approaches while working in
              Dr. Campbell's laboratory.  In the six months following Dr. Hoopes' return to
              Pomona College, she will set up her own laboratory to study the genetics and
              biochemistry of yeast proteins that act on DNA and teach a new course on The
              Molecular Genetics of Eukaryotic Regulation.
