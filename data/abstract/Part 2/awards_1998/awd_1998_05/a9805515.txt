     The principal investigator studies mathematical models
              of
cell population dynamics.  The models consist of linear and
nonlinear
              ordinary and partial differential equations.
Applications of the research are
              made to the following projects:
(1) population models of the blood production
              system and the
continuous maturation-proliferation of precursor stem cells;
              (2)
population models of the pathogenesis of HIV infection of the
human
              immune system and the depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes during
the stages of AIDS
              progression; (3) population models of
replicative histories of cell lines as
              indicated by shortening of
telomere fragment lengths on the ends of
              chromosomes; and (4)
population models of cell loss processes specific to the
              position
G1, S, G2, M, or G0 in the cell cycle.  In these models
              the
principal investigator studies the behavior of cells at the
population
              level and the dynamic processes of cell division, cell
maturation, cell
              mortality, naive cell sources, and cell
transition to and from quiescence. 
              The principal investigator
utilizes differential equations theory, operator
              theory,
functional analysis, numerical analysis, and
              computational
simulation.
     The significance of the research is in the
              development of
mathematical methods to analyze the qualitative behavior
              of
solutions to the differential equations that describe cell
population
              processes.  The principal investigator applies these
methods to the
              qualitative and quantitative understanding of cell
population problems.  In
              this research the mathematical theory of
population processes is applied to
              analyze normal and abnormal
blood cell production systems, the depletion of
              CD4 T cells in
the HIV infected immune system during HIV progression to
              AIDS,
and the growth of tumors.  The principal investigator studies
these
              biological phenomena as dynamic processes described by
mathematical models of
              population behavior.  The research combines
theoretical mathematical analysis
              and numerical computer
simulations of the models.  The goal of the research is
              to advance
understanding of normal and abnormal cell
              proliferation
processes.
