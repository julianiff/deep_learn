Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the reliability of performance assessments.  The
              project will develop a new approach to estimating reliability that reflects the
              precision of an assessment proceducre involving cognitively comples tasks and
              culturally diverse test takers.  It incorparates structural equation mocels
              that reflect the diverse ways people think and learn.  Structural equation
              modesl will be developed to compute construct relvelant variance components and
              will be applied to estimating the reliability of performance assessments using
              three approaches: theory fit, facet generalization, and prophecy analysis. 
              thus, the project will peroducae estimates of the reliability fo performance
              assessments that acknowledge the construct relevance of cognitively comples
              tasks and culturally diverse test takers.
