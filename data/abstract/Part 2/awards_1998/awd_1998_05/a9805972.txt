Abstract    :
              9805972  Schmidt  This research will apply statistical process control (SPC)
              techniques, commonly used to monitor quality in manufacturing systems, to the
              control of simulated annealing optimization algorithms.  Simulated annealing is
              a popular technique for complex problem optimization because it only requires
              calculations of the value of each potential solution.  Other techniques
              calculate evaluation function derivatives or do matrix manipulations. 
              Simulated annealing's drawback is that thousands or millions of solutions must
              be evaluated during the optimization process.  Preliminary research supports
              the use of SPC methods to detect productive search. Productive search is
              defined as search resulting in a period of significant change in the average
              value of the most recent set of proposed solutions.  If detectable, algorithms
              can be directed to run during only while the search is productive.    This work
              is to develop a refined implementation of a prototype detection of productive
              search annealing algorithm and supporting foundational theory.  The algorithm
              will be tested on selected problems from the Multidisciplinary Optimization
              Branch of NASA's Langley Research Center's test suite of engineering problems.
              This grant enables a more thorough investigation of this fledgling idea,
              allowing the researcher to bridge current work in design theory and designer
              assistance tools into operations research.
