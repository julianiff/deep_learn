This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport
              and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The
              principal investigator is Dr. Lawrence Tavlarides of Syracuse University. The
              research will lead to a class of organo-ceramic adsorbents to selectively
              extract specific metals. This is an engineering approach to the development of
              selective adsorbents by combining developments in two fairly disparate areas.
              Organic chelating agents  are functionalized with an inorganic unit so that
              they can participate in sol gel reactions and thereby become incorporated into
              a porous ceramic structure. The materials are classified as type III polycerms.
              These materials are novel  in that they incorporate specific chemical
              functionality  and thus impart selectivity to the organo-ceramic matrix.

The
              research has the potential to significantly impact technologies relating to the
              sequestration and recovery of toxic and/or high value metals. The sequestration
              of toxic metals is of extreme importance in pollution prevention and control.
              And the recovery of platinum based metals from spent catalysts is also very
              important to the petroleum refining and chemicals processing industries.
