Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9805887  H.D. Ou-Yang, Lehigh University  An approach to measure
              the in-situ instantaneous interparticle forces in colloidal suspensions using
              dual optical tweezers and phase lock-in methods is investigated.  The principle
              of measurement will be tested by conducting experiments to determine the
              minimum distance between tweezers, the measurement accuracy of the
              interparticle separation distance, the dynamic range of the force measurement,
              and the reduction of particle heating caused by optical tweezers.   The tests
              will focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between two particles, by comparing
              the experimental measurements to Stokes's drag force prediction.  One sphere
              (1-2 microns in diameter) will be trapped in a fixed position by strong
              tweezers (size of about 0.5 to 1 micron), and another sphere will be held at a
              given distance into oscillating weaker tweezers.  The laser has 1.06 micron
              wavelength in order to reduce particle heating.   The interparticle distance
              will be independently measured by using image analysis.   The proposed approach
              would allow for interparticle force measurements in dynamic conditions in
              colloidal suspensions.  Such measurements are of fundamental importance and are
              not possible by other means.  If successful, the method would have relevance to
              understanding a broad group of industrial and biological suspensions. The
              proposed project will explore the feasibility and the technical limits of the
              methods.  ***
