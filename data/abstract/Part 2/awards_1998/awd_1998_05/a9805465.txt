Abstract    :
              HRD-9805465  P.I.:  Leszcyski, Jerzy  Inst:  Jackson State University      The
              Computational Center for Molecular Structures and Interactions (CCMSI) will
              develop  at Jackson State University.  The Center will consist initially of
              faculty members from the  Department of Chemistry and will involve visiting
              faculty as well as faculty from the  University of California at Berkeley.  The
              faculty will be conducting collaborative research  of the development of
              efficient computational methodologies and their application to study  of
              structures and properties of molecules  In addition research collaboration and
              training  for undergraduate students from other regional undergraduate schools
              will be included  in the outreach program.
