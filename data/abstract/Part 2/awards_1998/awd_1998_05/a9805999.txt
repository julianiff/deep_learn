Abstract    :
                  The somatosensory system involves the sense of touch, and the  term haptic
              perception includes how objects are recognized by  touch, as well as their
              spatial relations.  In an interesting  parallel with visual processing, there
              is evidence that the brain  contains two pathways for information about touch,
              one for  perceiving 'what' an object is, and the other for 'where' it is.  This
              project will utilize current imaging technology (brain  scanning by fMRI and
              MEG techniques) with human subjects to  identify and localize the neural
              activity in tasks designed to  utilize primarily one or the other pathway in
              response to tactile  stimuli.  Differences in the two types of tactile
              processing will  reflect functional specialization in the somatosensory system.
                  This award is in the Professional Opportunities for Women in  Research &
              Education (POWRE) activity of NSF.  It will provide a  young woman a unique
              opportunity a a different campus to broaden  her technical expertise in the
              field of cognitive neuroscience by  getting training in neuroimaging, and bring
              that expertise back to  enhance her teaching and research at her home
              institution, and so  will have a significant impact on her career and on the
              home  institution.   The scientific results also will have an impact  because a
              better understanding of haptic perception is important  to sensory neuroscience
              in general, and could lead to substantial  advances in artificial or assistive
              technologies, such as aids for  the blind and for robotics.
