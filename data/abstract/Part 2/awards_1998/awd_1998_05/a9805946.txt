Abstract    :
              9805946  Holden  Bacteria in the terrestrial unsaturated zone exist in biofilms:
              attached to surfaces and encapsulated in a hydrated matrix of
              microbially-produced exopolymeric substances (EPS). The EPS matrix represents a
              mass transfer region, separating bacteria from one another and from the
              external pore environment. Mass transfer of carbon substrates through EPS may
              determine local rates of carbon turnover, but little is known about EPS in
              unsaturated environments and its effects on local substrate availability. If we
              are to understand the controls on organic matter and pollutant decomposition in
              unsaturated systems as a function of climatic or other environmental
              variations, we must first understand the controls on substrate availability at
              the scale of microbial biofilms. This research will: 1) determine the
              production and role of a bioemulsifying protein in unsaturated biofilms where
              the controls on protein production in culture are known; 2) determine the role
              of biofilm mass transfer region and its control on the rate of weakly soluble
              substrate metabolism; 3) determine the influence of water potential on
              emulsifier production, EPS mass transfer characteristics, and bacterial
              metabolism of weakly soluble substrates; and 4) develop and test a bacterial
              biosensor of weakly soluble substrates for use in lab and field studies. This
              POWRE-supported research will provide fundamental knowledge of the bacterial
              micro-environment in unsaturated systems, by studying mechanisms that operate
              at particularly challenging, but extremely important spatial scales of
              resolution.
