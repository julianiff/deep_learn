Greatly improved measurements of the magnetic moment of the
              electron (the g-factor) and the fine structure constant alpha will be carried
              out.  These independent measurements of g and alpha will allow testing of
              quantum electrodynamics theory to an unprecedented level of accuracy.   A
              comparison of the g factors for the electron and positron will provide an
              additional test of CPT invariance.
