Abstract    :
              9805719  DiSalvo    The objective of this research is to explore the synthesis
              of new  solid state nitrides, their crystal structure and properties.  Since a
              number of binary nitrides have considerable technological  utility as for
              example, coatings, ceramics, and superconductors,  we propose to study more
              complex nitrides that may lead to  enhanced or new properties.  Our approaches
              include the use of  electropositive metals to stabilize a ternary phase and of
              sodium  flux to grow small crystals of some compounds.  We will also  expand
              our synthetic methods to the use of metallic fluxes that  are more generally
              useful than sodium, specifically gallium,  magnesium, and zinc.  The structures
              and properties of these  materials will be compared to related compounds such
              as oxides,  sulfides or phosphides.  %%%  Binary Nitrides, such as Silicon
              Nitride, Aluminum Nitride,  Titanium Nitride, and Gallium Nitride have many
              technological  uses as solid state lasers, hard coatings, and high temperature 
              ceramics.  Yet more complex nitrides have not been prepared or  studied.  This
              research will focus on establishing the methods of  preparing such materials
              and on their crystal structures and  properties.  ***
