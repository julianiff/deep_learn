              Abstract  ATM-9805293  Kelts, Kerry R.  University of Minnesota  Title: IDEAL:
              Lake Victoria and Lake Edward Basin Sedimentation  History    This award
              supports a project to complete sedimentary environment  analyses on the
              available IDEAL cores and to address the major new  questions of spatial and
              temporal patterns and continuity within  the basinal sediment sequences of
              Lakes Victoria and Edward.  Sediment stratigraphy underpins the interpretation
              of paleoclimate  and ecological histories.  These studies apply a diverse set
              of  sediment and geochemical tools designed to resolve a set of primary 
              questions concerning the history of Lake Victoria and its  relationship to the
              River Nile and the Holocene sediment cyclicity  in Lake Edward.
