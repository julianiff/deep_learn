Abstract    :
              This project consists of a strongly collaborative passive broadband seismic
              experiment in India with the National Geophysical Research Institue (NGRI) in
              Hyderabad.  NGRI will use their own funding to deploy 20 broadband seismic
              instruments along a linear profile from Hyderabad north to the Himalayan Front.
               The objectives of this proposed work are a systematic mapping of the Indian
              lithospheric structure and the establishment of a long-term collaborative
              program with NGRI seismologists.  The proposed line transects large portions of
              the cratonic Indian subcontinent and will allow us to address major scientific
              issues including whether the Precambrian crustal and mantle structure of India
              is consistent with global models of Archean lithospheric evolution.  The
              transect will also provide constraints on the deep structure of the Deccan Trap
              volcanic flood basalt region, the shape of the Indus-Ganges basin, and the
              initial structure of India prior to its subduction beneath southern
              Asia.

This project is being co-funded with International Programs
