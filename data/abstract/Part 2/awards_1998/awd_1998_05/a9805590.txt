The objectives of this project are the design and analysis
              of robust and accurate finite element methods for problems arising from
              mechanics and electromagnetics and the construction of iterative algorithms for
              solving the resulting algebraic systems.  The research will focus on the
              investigation of negative norm least-squares finite element methods for
              div-curl systems and the Maxwell equations.  These equations are
              representatives of a class of first order systems arising from fluid and
              electromagnetics.  Applications of the proposed work occur in, for example, the
              design of accelerator and beam control magnets, fusion devices, and electrical
              motor design.

Finite element methods based on negative norm least-squares
              principles provide a natural approach to the numerical solution of those
              problems.  The negative norm least-square methods have a number of attractive
              features.  Like mixed finite element methods, variables of most interest can be
              approximated directly instead of a posteriori.  However, least-squares methods
              are not subject to the inf-sup stability condition and hence the finite element
              spaces are selected based solely on approximation properties and computational
              cost.  The convergence of negative norm least-squares methods requires only a
              moderate amount of smoothness on the solution.  Moreover, the corresponding
              algebraic system is symmetric and positive definite and hence can be solved
              effectively by, e.g., the preconditioned conjugate gradient method.  The
              proposed methods will exploit both the mathematical structure of model problems
              and the computational features of negative norm least-squares principles.
