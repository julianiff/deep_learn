Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation will continue its long term  support of the
              University of  Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring  Research. This grant allows the
              laboratory to hire a full-time  dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological
              samples and also  provides support for student  assistants.    The technique of
              tree-ring dating was pioneered at the University of Arizona.  Because the rate
              of treegrowth is determined by environmental  conditions, yearly growth rings
              in a tree vary in form and thickness. It is possible to build up a tree ring
              chronology by  cross matching trees from the present to well back in the 
              prehistoric past and then to use this `master record` to date  small wood
              samples collected from archaeological and other  situations. For archaeologists
              in the Southwestern United States,  this technique has been a boon because it
              allows materials to be  dated within one year. This far exceeds the accuracy of
               radiocarbon dating.    Because it has not been adequately supported and
              because many  archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the 
              Arizona laboratory has not  been able on its own to keep pace with 
              archaeological requests for sample dating. This grant will  help  to remedy
              that situation.  In particular, it will benefit young  scientists and those not
               associated with more wealthy main line research  institutions.
