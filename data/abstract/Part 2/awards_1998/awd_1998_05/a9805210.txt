Abstract    :
              9805210  Moser  The problem of early crust formation in the Archean is a
              critical one bearing on planetary evolution and on crust-mantle relationships
              in what has become known as the 'tectosphere.'  Because of the lack of exposure
              of the lower crust, there are very few places where this can be studied. 
              However, the Kaapvaal area is one place where a major section of the crust has
              been tilted in the region surrounding the Vredefort impact structure.  It is
              here that this study will focus on the relationship between the lower crust and
              upper mantle, focusing in particularly on the how the lower crust came to be
              welded to the upper mantle that now forms a strong mantle 'keel.'  If
              successful, this study will shed light on the early evolution of the crust in
              South Africa, but with general applications to the origin of the lithosphere on
              earth and on other similar planets.
