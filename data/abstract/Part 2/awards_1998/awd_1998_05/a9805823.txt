              Systems with Haptic User Interfaces    In USA today, about 5% of the industrial
              salary base is spent on training. Training systems based on virtual
              environments (VE) will enable workers to practice operating new equipment
              before it is installed, and perhaps more importantly, will allow the results of
              improper operation to be simulated without incurring the associated costs. The
              biggest deficiency in VE systems is their inability to animate the motions of
              bodies in contact. For example, a dropped wrench will usually either magically
              disappear from the   virtual scene, or accelerate through all obstacles in its
              path.    This project will develop fundamental technical results and algorithms
              needed to: (1) embed the physics of moving bodies into the underlying motion
              simulator, (2) allow two-way interaction between the user and the VE through a
              haptic device, (3) provide a system to help workers plan complex maintenance
              tasks, and (4) systematically analyze the effects of uncertainty in the
              parameters of the dynamic and geometric models of the VE. The postdoctoral
              researcher will participate in the high-level design of the VE training system,
              and will have primary responsibility for one or more of the system components.
              His/her expertise will enable the project to produce a higher-quality, more
              robust system.
