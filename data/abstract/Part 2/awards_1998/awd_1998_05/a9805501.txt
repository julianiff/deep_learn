     The investigator develops mathematical models
              and
computational methods for studying two specific moving boundary
problems
              in biofluids: the motion of eukaryotic cilia and
flagella and the mathematical
              modeling and numerical simulation
of the growing embryonic vertebrate limb
              bud.  The model for the
cilia and flagella axoneme incorporates discrete
              representations
of the individual dynein arms, a mechanical model of
              the
axoneme's elastic structures such as the microtubules and nexin
links,
              and a continuous description of the surrounding fluid
mechanics.  The model
              for limb bud outgrowth and patterning
consists of a fluid-mechanical
              description of the limb bud
tissue, a reaction-diffusion-advection component
              that governs the
spatio-temporal distribution of growth factors and
              morphogens
produced in specialized regions such as the apical
              ectodermal
ridge and the zone of polarizing activity, and a moving
              elastic
boundary that represents the limb bud ectoderm's
              viscoelastic
properties.  In the three-dimensional model, the limb bud
              ectoderm
is modeled as a network of nodes connected by linear
              elastic
elements.  The investigator also develops an algorithm for
imposing
              the appropriate boundary conditions in solving
              the
reaction-diffusion-advection equations.  Because each of these
models
              includes a fluid-mechanical representation, the
investigator uses a similar
              computational approach based on the
immersed boundary method and the computer
              codes share many of the
major subroutines.
     The purpose of this research
              project is the development of
mathematical models and computational methods
              for studying moving
boundary problems in complex biological systems.  The
              investigator
develops two types of models: one for the motion of
              eukaryotic
cilia and flagella and the second for the growth dynamics
              of
multicellular biological systems.  Both of these models involve
new
              approaches to the modeling of viscoelastic materials in
biology and share a
              common computational point of view.  The
object in the first project is to
              develop a three-dimensional
model for the individual cilium or flagellum. 
              Although a great
deal has been discovered regarding the
              biochemistry,
ultrastructure and movement of eukaryotic cilia and flagella,
              the
mechanisms governing the control of oscillatory motion and
bending are
              not well understood.  The goal of the cilia and
flagella modeling is to
              develop a three-dimensional model that
can serve as a platform for studying
              the mechanochemical
mechanisms that control the waveforms.  Growth plays an
              important
process for multicellular organisms as well as communities
              of
single cell organisms.  The investigator develops a model of
vertebrate
              limb development that incorporates the growth and
movement of cells and tissue
              within the developing limb bud, the
transport and production of growth factors
              within the limb bud,
and a moving boundary that represents the mechanical
              and
biochemical properties of the limb bud ectoderm.  The development
of this
              model and the computational methods for solving the
associated mathematical
              equations has application to the study of
a variety of multicellular systems
              where growth is an essential
feature, including growth and pattern formation
              in developmental
biology, the growth of bacterial colonies, as well as
              tumor
growth.  An important aspect of this project is the development
              of
numerical methods for studying the models; advances in this area
can be
              used in a variety of problems in the field of
computational biofluids.
