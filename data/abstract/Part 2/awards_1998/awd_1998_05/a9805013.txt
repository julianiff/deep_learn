Abstract    :
              9805013  Bickford   The Paleoproterozoic of southwestern United States consists
              of a series of accreted terranes attached to the Superior province.  The
              assumption that these terranes are juvenile arcs and represent essentially new
              mantle-derived crust has had a major impact on calculations of crustal growth. 
              However, some of these rocks contain a distinctly bimodal volcanic suite which
              are intruded by calcalkaline plutons.  This association is more consistent with
              a rifting tectonic environment, bringing up the possibility of the presence of
              older material, not just juvenile.  This project will study rocks in the
              Central Colorado region to explore this possibility.  Results will very
              significant to regional reconstructions and crustal studies.
