              Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9805196    Principal Investigator: Shiferaw Berhanu   
              This award furnishes partial support for a conference to be held at Temple
              University on April 5-7, 1998. The conference, organized as a tribute to the
              life and work of Leon Ehrenpreis, focuses on those mathematical areas to which
              Professor Ehrenpreis has made major contributions: PDE, Several Complex
              Variables, Integral Geometry, and Number Theory. The conference is coordinated
              with and complemented by three special sessions at the meeting of the American
              Mathematical Society that Temple University will host the weekend of April 4,
              1998. If the participants in those special sessions are included, the complete
              list of speakers involved in this recognition of Professor Ehrenpreis is
              impressively long and distinguished.
