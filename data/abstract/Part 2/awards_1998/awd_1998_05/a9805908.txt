Abstract    :
              Mulkey  9805908      In many parts of the tropics, the E1 Nino Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO)  causes dry, sunny years (E1 Nino) alternating with wet,
              cloudy years  (La Nina). Against this background of interannual variation in 
              sunlight, we will document the effect of ENSO on tree productivity by 
              manipulating carbon budgets of branches of two wet-forest canopy tree  species.
              This will be accomplished through augmentation of light in  the canopy and
              shading of the most recent crop of leaves on  experimental branches during
              critical periods for carbon gain. Light  will be augmented with stadium lamps
              erected on towers above the  canopy and powered by a generator, while shading
              will be provided with  shade cloth. The canopy will be accessed from a large,
              freestanding  crane. Carbon allocation during and following experimental
              periods  will be assessed from photosynthesis, variation in nonstructural 
              carbohydrate, and measures of reproductive output. An empirical model  of
              branch carbon balance will be used to assess integrated carbon gain  and
              compensatory responses of manipulated branches, and relate these  data to
              carbonhydrate accumulation in branch wood. In addition to  documenting the role
              of this global climate event on tree  productivity, this work will test the
              hypothesis that wet-season cloud  cover limits the productivity of rainforests.
