This research deals with the mapping of seismic anisotropy in
              the continental crust and upper mantle of the Earth.  In both the crust and
              upper mantle, seismic anisotropy can arise from preferred mineral orientations
              and fine layering of contrasting rock types.  In the crust, anisotropy from
              aligned cracks is also often present, especially in the upper few km.  The
              strength of anisotropy, its distribution with depth, its relation to plate
              motion, and the relation between mantle and crustal deformation are pivotal for
              our understanding of the mechanisms of continental formation and Earth history.
               This work will combine two complementary body-wave techniques: shear-wave
              splitting, and P-SH conversions in the P-coda.  Continents are the
              longest-lasting surface remnants of the plate-tectonic engine, and also the
              principal record of this engine's activity prior to the Mesozoic.  By
              characterizing the patterns of seismic anisotropy in the continental regions of
              the Earth, this research will investigate the record of process dynamics.
