Available radiometric age determinations and previous
              paleomagnetic investigations on Tahitian lavas indicate that much of the island
              was experiencing volcanic activity some 780,000 years ago while Earth's
              magnetic field was undergoing its last change of polarity--the termination of
              the Matuyama reverse polarity chron.  The P.I. proposes to continue a
              comprehensive paleomagnetic study of the recorded transitional field behavior
              at appropriate localities on the island.  In particular, plans include
              extending sampling of the thick sequence of transitionally-magnetized lavas at
              the end of the Chemin des 1000 Sources in northern Tahiti, a section that has
              already provided a highly-detailed record of magnetic field changes well within
              the polarity transition.  Precise 40Ar-39Ar age determinations will be
              conducted on these basaltic lavas at the University
of Geneva, Switzerland,
              with the ultimate goal of following in absolute time the process of field
              reversal as it developed in Earth's fluid outer core.
