Abstract    :
                Description: This award is for the support of participation by eight US
              mathematicians to participate in the `International Conference on Mathematics
              and Its Applications` to be held at Birzeit University (BZU), in the West Bank.
               The organizers are Dr. Saber Elaydi of Trinity University in San Antonio,
              Texas and Dr. Fathi Allan, Professor of Mathematics at Birzeit University.  
              The meeting is planned for August 20-23, 1998.  The meeting is expected to be
              attended by more than 200 mathematicians from most Middle Eastern countries. 
              The focus will be on recent developments in mathematical analysis and
              applications, technology and curriculum development in undergraduate education.
               The proceedings will be published by an international publisher.  Scope:  This
              project will support participation by US mathematicians in the first such
              meeting to be held in a Palestinian academic institution.  The meeting will
              provide a forum for the Palestinian and US mathematicians to interact at an
              important juncture in the development of the region.  It is expected that the
              interactions during this meeting will lead to identification of potential
              collaboration between US and Palestinian mathematicians in research, and in
              mathematics education in developing countries.  The participation of the US is
              critical for the success of this undertaking because of the leading role that
              US mathematicians have in research and education.  The project will be of
              mutual benefit to the United States and to the West Bank as well as to other
              participants.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of
              International Programs.  The Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Mathematical Sciences jointly support this award.
