This project will collect Global Positioning System
              (GPS) data from new and existing sites on the Kenai Peninsula, southern Alaska,
              and use those data to test models of subduction zone dynamics.  Past geodetic
              work carried out in this region has shown large along-strike variations in the
              present-day deformation of the overriding plate.  Relative to the (overriding)
              North American plate, sites in the eastern part of the peninsula move in the
              direction of relative Pacific-North America plate motion, while sites in the
              western part of the peninsula move trenchward, roughly opposite to the
              direction of relative plate motion.  A number of physical models, with
              differing implications for the kinematics and dynamics of the subduction zone,
              might explain these results.  A better spatial distribution of data and more
              precise vertical motion rates are needed to distinguish between models.  The
              P.I. will include a careful analysis of leveling and tide gauge data to
              characterize more fully the response to the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake in
              this region, and its implications for models of the earthquake cycle.
