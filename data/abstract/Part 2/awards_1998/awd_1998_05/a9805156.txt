Abstract    :
              9805156                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Cline                                                                          
                                                                                             
                           Funds were requested to help subsidize the costs of young
              scientists (graduate students and early-career professionals) to attend the Pan
              American Current Research on Fluid Inclusions Conference (PACROFI VII) that
              will be held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, from June 1 to 4, 1998.
              Funds will be distributed by the two co-convenors of the conference, and it is
              their intent to support young scientists who can provide some of their own
              costs on a matching basis. The attendance of young scientists at this meeting
              is important because they bring new and innovative ideas to the science, and
              because they are responsible for future research in the field. Attendance at
              the conference will provide these young scientists with the opportunity to
              learn from established international leaders in fluid inclusion research, and
              to initiate collaborative projects with other researchers in academia,
              industry, and government agencies and laboratories.
