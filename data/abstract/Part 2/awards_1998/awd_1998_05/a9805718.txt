Abstract    :
              The PIN diode is a semiconductor device used in a wide  variety of applications
              such as high frequency  communications circuits and high power generation
              equipment.  This project is developing and testing a general CAD model  for the
              PIN diode. The model is applicable to PIN diodes  made of either elemental
              semiconductors or compound  materials. The project builds upon current and past
              modeling  efforts to develop a model for the PIN diode that can be 
              incorporated into SPICE-like simulators. The project work  also includes
              exploring a methodology for extracting  simulator modeling parameters from
              experimental  measurements. Undergraduate students are being involved in  the
              project to develop automated test equipment, measure  various semiconductor
              devices at both dc and high frequency,  and creating and  maintaining a web
              site for dissemination  of research results.
