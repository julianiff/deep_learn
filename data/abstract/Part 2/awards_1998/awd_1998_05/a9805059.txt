Abstract    :
              HRD-9805059  P.I.:  Ries, Heidi  Inst.:  Norfolk State University      The
              Center for Photonic Materials Research will build upon existing strength in
              materials  science and spectroscopy research.  Materials with unique o ptical
              properties will be  prepared and studied as well as materials with
              semiconductor and organic material  interfaces.  The Center seeks to develop an
              understading of electron dynamics, energy  transfer, and energy storage in
              specific materials.  Outreach to highschool and  undergraduate students to
              encourage the pursuit of advanced degrees in the sciences  and engineering will
              be accomplished by close interaction with Cooperating Hampton  Roads
              Organization Minority Participation programs throughout the nation.
