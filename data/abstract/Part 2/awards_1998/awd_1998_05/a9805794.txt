Abstract    :
              9805794  Dorsey   The San Jacinto fault zone represents high seismic hazard in
              California.  This POWER project will enable the Principal Investigator to make
              a significant career move into integrative study of young sedimentary basins
              and basin-bounding faults in activity deforming zones.
