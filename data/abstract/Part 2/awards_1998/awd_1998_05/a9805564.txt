Abstract    :
              9805564  Cantrell    This Americas Program award will support a regional meeting
               on the topic of nonlinear differential equations to honor  Prof. Alan Laser's
              many contributions to the field.  Organized by Dr. Robert Cantrell and Dr.
              George Cosner of  the University of Miami, the conference will bring together 
              leading scholars from North America, Europe, and Latin  America, expert in the
              study of nonlinear phenomena and its  applications.  Proceedings will be
              distributed via the  Electronic Journal of Differential Equations ensuring 
              widespread availability.    Partial support for this conference is being
              provided by the  Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of 
              International Programs of NSF to stimulate the participation  of advanced
              graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s from the  Americas.  ***
