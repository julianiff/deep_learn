New
              Mexico Highlands University will build on the strong research group base in the
              area of Dynamical Investigations of Molecular Hyperpolarizabilities using
              Optically Mediated-Charge Transfer to form a more comprehensive program
              suitable for a fule CREST Center award.  This three-year effort will focus on
              management, research infrastructure, outreach to undergraduate underrepresented
              minorities, and interaction with other regional institutions.
