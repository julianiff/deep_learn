Abstract    :
                Menopause is universal, experienced by all women who live beyond middle age. 
              However, most research on menopause has been carried out in developed
              countries, e.g., the U.S. (Minnesota and Massachusetts), Canada, Western Europe
              (particularly the Netherlands), and Japan.  This research will examine
              variation in age and symptom experience at menopause in an urban population in
              Mexico.  Three very different neighborhoods in the city of Puebla will be
              randomly sampled to compare the experience of three groups of women, 200
              participants each.  Variation in age at menopause will be examined in relation
              to a number of variables, such as smoking habits, recalled childhood nutrition,
              body size, and reproductive history.  Symptom experience at menopause will be
              examined in relation to such factors as breastfeeding practices, current diet,
              amount of leisure time, and access to health care.  Hot flash frequency will
              also be physiologically measured in a subset of women in a clinic setting to
              determine whether or not there are cross- cultural differences in sensitivity
              to hot flashes.  By examining menopause in an urban setting in Mexico, this
              study will provide important information to contrast with recent North
              American, European, and East Asian research on age and experience at menopause.
               It is important to have comparative data from different countries and cultures
              on age and symptoms at menopause since we do not yet understand what aspects of
              menopause are universal (i.e., biological) and what aspects are influenced by
              culture.
