     This project concerns the fluid dynamics of aquatic
              animal
locomotion, a field that encompasses the study of flagellar
motility
              as well as invertebrate swimming.  The investigator and
her colleages explore
              the coupling of the internal
force-generating mechanisms of the organisms with
              an external
viscous, incompressible fluid.  A unified computational
              approach
can be adapted to model the internal axoneme mechanics of a
beating
              cilium, the force-generating internal flagella of
spirochetes, as well as the
              coupling of active and passive tissue
properties to the swimming mechanics of
              a leech.  In addition to
modeling the dynamics of a single organism, the
              collective
hydrodynamic interactions of groups of organisms and
              their
environment can be examined.  The investigator has developed
              a
mathematical model designed to study the coupled mechanical
system
              comprised of the fluid and the immersed organism.  The
numerical method used
              is the immersed boundary method.  The full
incompressible Navier-Stokes
              equations are solved in a domain of
fluid within which neutrally-buoyant
              organisms undergoing
time-dependent movements are immersed.  The salient
              feature of
this method is that the suspended organism is replaced by
suitable
              contributions to a force density term in the fluid
dynamics equations.
    
              This interdisciplinary project employs modern methods in
scientific computing
              to study important biological processes.  The
understanding of bacterial
              motility and aggregation is of vital
importance in bioremediation, the process
              by which bacteria are
used to degrade toxic chemicals.  In addition, the study
              of the
internal mechanisms of cilia, flagella and spirochetes
              has
applications in medicine and biotechnology.  The computational
algorithms
              developed in this project will be useful in studying
other biofluiddynamic
              problems as well as contributing to
expertise in high performance
              computing.
