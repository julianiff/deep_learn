Our main goal is to characterize the different O-rich
              reservoirs inferred to have been present in the solar nebula region where
              individual chondrite groups formed, or to have been present in the chondrite
              parent bodies and have been responsible for alteration effects increasingly
              recognized in the unequilibrated chondrites.  There is increasing evidence that
              the oxygen-isotopic composition of the nebular gas evolved during the period
              recorded in the various classes on chondritic meteorites.  We will use the UCLA
              Cameca 1270 ion-microprobe to study O-isotopes in key phases that were formed
              at low temperatures in the solar nebula or during aqueous alteration that
              occurred within the parent asteroid.  The high efficiency and high resolution
              of the Cameca 1270 permits us to determine the three oxygen isotopes in phases
              exposed in petrographic thin sections, thus textural and chemical information
              about the formation process is preserved. During the first two years of this
              grant we plan to focus our studies on the alteration product magnetite in R and
              ordinary chondrites.  When magnetite forms from metal or FeS, all the O comes
              from the oxidant, inferred to have been H2O in most cases.  We will also study
              another alteration product, the fayalite present in CV chondrites.
