Abstract    :
              9805437  Storm    Research in solid state and materials chemistry is undergoing 
              tremendous growth while at the same time the character of the  research is
              changing due in large part from the need to explore  new classes of
              technologically important materials made possible  by the advent of new solid
              state synthetic strategies. This  meeting will bring together experts in the
              field of solid state  chemistry to inform a broad range of inorganic, solid
              state and  materials chemists about the latest advances in this field to 
              include new synthetic tools involving high pressure,  supercritical fluids, and
              crystal engineering for the  preparation of novel materials such as porous
              modular solids,  composites, perovskites, complex arsenides and antimonides, 
              sulfides and  phosphides.  %%%  New materials classes of high technological
              importance are  emerging at a rapid rate due in large part to the development
              of  new solid state synthetic strategies that provide new materials  exhibiting
              a wide range of interesting properties such as  thermoelectric, dielectric,
              ferroelectric, and colossal  magnetoresistance. These approaches have recently
              been used by  industrial firms searching for new materials for diverse 
              applications such as batteries, fuel cells, detectors, and  refrigeration.  ***
