Abstract    :
              9805200  Nicholson   In circumstances where tectonic plates are interaction in
              an oblique convergent manner, material is commonly moving in and out of a plane
              normal to the suture as well as within the plane.  Thus 2-dimensional
              cross-sections may not be adequate to record the deformation.  This project
              will utilize a large sub-surface data set in an oblique convergent situation to
              test reliability of 2-D vs 3-D methods and to provide geometric insight into
              processes active in this tectonic situation.
