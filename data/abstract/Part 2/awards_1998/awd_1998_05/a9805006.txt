This research is a continuation of an investigation of the
              upper-mantle transition-zone structure in and around subducting slabs around
              the Philippine Sea, Japan Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and Bohai Sea.  In
              the Japan region, the stagnant, or flattened, slab appears to be smaller than
              earlier tomographic studies would suggest.  Lateral variations within the
              transition zone appear to be substantial.  These results were obtained by means
              of 1-D modeling, and therefore are somewhat limited.  The current research will
              utilize a 2-D finite difference scheme to improve the modeling.  The work is
              carried out in collaboration with scientists at the Earthquake Research
              Institute (ERI) at the University of Tokyo.  This short-wave-length work will
              be combined with the large-scale results from the University of Tokyo to
              provide a more accurate upper mantle transition zone model for the western
              Pacific.  These results will be important for the constraint of vertical
              convection models across the transition zone boundaries.
