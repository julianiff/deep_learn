Carlin-type gold deposits (CTDs) are a major focus of mining
              and exploration activity in the US today, yet processes leading to their
              genesis are poorly understood. The goal of this research is to investigate the
              causes and conditions of Carlin-type gold deposit formation by addressing
              questions regarding the timing of deposition and the relationship between
              hydrothermal circulation, ore deposition, and magmatic and tectonic events. Of
              particular importance is resolution of the question of whether there is a
              common theme responsible for CTD formation either through magmatic association
              or unique tectonic environment. In order to address the fundamental issue of
              CTD formation age several avenues will be followed at individual deposits in
              the Carlin Trend: acquisition and synthesis of geological, petrological and
              structural data; stable isotope comparison of mineralizing fluids with secular
              curves for meteoric waters; conventional and laser-assisted argon geochronology
              on igneous rocks and alteration minerals; fission-track dating of apatite and
              zircon; and U-Pb dating of hydrothermal apatite. In addition, the applicability
              of the rhenium-osmium system for direct dating of gold-bearing sulfides will be
              explored. By understanding the timing of ore deposition additional constraints
              will be placed on the potential sources of fluids and heat to drive
              hydrothermal circulation in Carlin-type gold deposits.
