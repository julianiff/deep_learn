Abstract    :
              9805693  Bhargava, Bharat  Purdue University    CISE PostDoc: Experiments in
              Adaptable Communication Services    This research project will develop
              innovative adaptability mechanisms in communication software and conduct
              experiments to evaluate their impact on quality of service (QoS) available to
              emerging applications such as video conferencing and multimedia/digital
              library. Focusing on adaptability in active networks (for flexible control of
              services), transmission scheme (for reliability), and anomaly management (for
              bandwidth constraint, etc.); the project will also provide training to a
              Postdoctoral Associate, while  considering both wide area networks and mobile
              networks. Two directions constitute the main thrust. The first aims towards
              extending the infrastructure for experimenting with adaptable communication
              services. The second conducts a series of experiments that evaluate a variety
              of adaptability schemes. Two sample experiments explore Feasibility of Active
              Techniques in Adaptability and Re-transmission Scheme and its Effect on
              Reliability. Since Raid Laboratory has an infrastructure for experiments in 
              adaptability, communication, and video conferencing, these experiments are
              conducted there. The experiments, along with necessary software tools, will be
              designed by the postdoc; thus significantly increasing both the quality and
              variety of experiments that are planned and the system support for the Ph.D
              theses of graduate students. This research can make emerging applications to
              run at top efficiency and optimize network resources.
