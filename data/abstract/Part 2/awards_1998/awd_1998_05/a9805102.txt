                    Nabelek                                                                  
                                                                                             
                               The PI will conduct a numerical study of contact metamorphism
              in the calc-silicate Notch Peak aureole, Utah, to obtain better understanding
              of hydrodynamic parameters that control thermal evolution and fluid flow in
              contact aureoles. They will build on currently available petrologic and
              geochemical parameters on flow of reactive fluids as reflected by mineral
              assemblages and geochemistry of the aureole. The parameters include: (1) budget
              of magmatic, metamorphic and formation fluid sources, (2) layered,
              lithologically  controlled permeability structure of the aureole, (3) transient
              porosities, including those resulting from fracturing and volume changes in
              metamorphic rocks, (4)  transient thermal field, (5) latent heat of
              crystallization of magma, (6) consumption of heat by metamorphic reactions and
              heating of fluids, and (7) observed geometry of the intrusion and its aureole.
              Numerical simulations will be constrained by previous petrologic and
              geochemical results on fluid flow in the overall aureole and by detailed
              morphologic, mineralogic, and stable isotope analyses of outcrops. The
              outcrop-scale data will give indications of flow geometry, type of porosity and
              permeability, and fluid flux on scale of individual beds. Besides a better
              understanding of the Notch Peak aureole, the results will be a significant
              contribution to the knowledge of metamorphism, because the parameters to be
              investigated are fundamental to fluid flow associated with all contact
              aureoles.
