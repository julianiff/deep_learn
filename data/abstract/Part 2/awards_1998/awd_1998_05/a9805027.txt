This project consists of a series of laboratory
              experiments designed to measure the rates of self diffusion in minerals found
              in refractory inclusions and chondrules in undifferentiated meteorites.   These
              inclusions commonly preserve primordial isotopic and chemical disequilibrium
              amongst coexisting phases, which requires that they were never subsequently
              heated to the point where they could re-equilibrate through diffusive exchange.
               Thus, many meteorite inclusions retain crucial clues about their thermal
              histories.  The goal of this work is to experimentally calibrate the conditions
              under which isotopic heterogeneities found in these inclusions can be
              preserved.  The principal focus of the experiments will be Mg diffusion in
              anorthite, melilite, and hibonite to assess the preservation of 26Mg anomalies
              produced by the decay of 26Al.  Additional measurements of Ca and Ti
              diffusivities in hibonite, pyroxene, and melilite will help refine the thermal
              constraints.  The results will be combined with planetary formation models to
              help constrain the size distribution, assembly timescales, and thermal
              histories of early planetesimals into which these object were included. 
              Natural and synthetic single crystals will be annealed at 1 atm pressure and
              diffusion profiles measured by SIMS.
