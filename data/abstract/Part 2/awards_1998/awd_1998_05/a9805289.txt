TERC, Michigan State University, and the Math Forum at
              Swarthmore College propose to explore the development of a new emerging
              publication genre: hpyerlinked articles containing embedded film footage of
              teaching and learning along with diverse analyses provided by experts from
              different fields and disciplines.  Text cannot capture all that goes on in a
              filmed episode.  Multimedia, on the other hand, enables the display of video
              together with other means of analysis, such as transcriptions, commentaries,
              simulations, etc., and opens up the possibility that the articles themselves
              can grow and benefit from the insights and reflections of  readers.  In this
              respect, multimedia articles can become multilayered and multiauthored over
              time.
