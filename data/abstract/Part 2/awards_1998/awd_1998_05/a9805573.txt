Abstract    :
              9805573  Barger    This U.S.-Brazil award will support  a research collaboration
              between Dr.  Vernon D. Barger of the University  of Wisconsin, Madison and Dr.
              Oscar  J. P. Eboli of the Universidade  Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Sao 
              Paulo, Brazil.      Drs. Barger and Eboli are bringing  together groups of
              physicists from  the U.S. and Brazil to work on  phenomenological problems in 
              particle physics, fostering stronger  interaction between the theoretical  and
              experimental physics communities  in both countries.  Some ofthe  topics they
              will investigate are:  manifestations of nonperturbative  aspects of QCD,
              quarkonium  production, neutrino physics and  astrophysics, electroweak 
              phenomenology within and beyond the  Standard Model, and supersymmetry 
              phenomenology at future colliders.    In addition to the researchers at  the
              University of Wisconsin and  UNESP, physicists from the  University of Hawaii,
              the University  of Sao Paulo, University of  Campinas, and UNESP in
              Guaratingueta  will be participating in the  collaboration.      ***
