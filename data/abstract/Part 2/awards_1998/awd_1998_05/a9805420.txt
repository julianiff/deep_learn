Many schools are adopting integrated science curricula just as
              they gain access to the Internet.  The new class schedules, teaching
              strategies, and curriculum demands of integrated science are thus compbined
              with the challenge of incorporating a new technology.  Integrated science
              instruction enables students to explore relevant and enduring science problems
              such as global ecology, space exploration, or cures for disease.  Connecting to
              local issues and expertise makes science come alive for learners. We propose a
              Web-based Integrated Science Environment (WISE) to capitalize on the synergies
              between Internet connectivity and Integrated sceince instruction.
