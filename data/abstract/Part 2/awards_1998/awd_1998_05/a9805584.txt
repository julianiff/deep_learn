The PI proposes to develop techniques, algorithms, and
              computer code through which the Conley index will become an effective
              computational tool.  There are a wide variety of problems motivating this
              development.  The primary issue is that of being able to compute invariant sets
              for nonlinear dynamical systems arising from differential equations or physical
              experiments.  Since in general invariant sets can undergo dramatic bifurcations
              under small perturbations, numerical errors, parameter drift, and noise tend to
              make direct approximations of invariant sets numerically unstable.

Being an
              algebraic topological quantity, the Conley index is extremely stable with
              respect to perturbations.  At the same time it is fine enough to provide useful
              information  (e.g. symbolic dynamics) about the structure of the invariant set.
               Computing the Conley index involves two steps: (1) approximating the dynamics,
              and (2) computing algebraic topological quantities.  Both of these issues are
              being addressed in this project. Specific applications include joint work with
              experimentalists to analyze and control chaotic systems, and the rigorous
              numerical analysis of low dimensional attractors of high dimensional ordinary
              differential equations and partial differential equations.
