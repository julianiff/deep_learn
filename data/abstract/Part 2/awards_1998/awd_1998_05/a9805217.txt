Plastic Deformation of Transition Zone Minerals

The
              transition zone of the Earth's mantle (~ 410 to 660 km deep) is the zone in
              which a series of phase transformations are considered to occur in mantle
              minerals and in which complicated interactions between convection currents and
              phase transformations are inferred from high resolution seismic tomography. 
              The main aim of this project is to obtain experimental constraints on the
              rheological properties of transition zone minerals to better understand the
              details of these interactions.  The team (PI, post doc and a graduate student)
              will conduct a detailed investigation of the rheological properties of
              germanate analogues of mantle minerals using their newly developed technique of
              large-strain shear deformation at high pressures and high temperatures.  The
              relative strength of pairs of transition zone minerals as well as the
              sensitivity of deformation to grain-size will be determined.  The results will
              provide the first quantitative data set to investigate the role of the
              transition zone in the global process of mantle convection.
