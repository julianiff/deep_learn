Abstract    :
              We consider the problem of blind adaptive filtering in high-  dimension vector
              spaces with limited data sample support. The  focus application is joint
              space-time adaptive processing for  DS/CDMA communications systems with antenna
              arrays.  The  objective is the development of fast, low complexity optimization
               procedures that exhibit superior disturbance (multiple-access-  interference
              and channel noise) suppression characteristics in  small data support
              situations. The low optimization complexity  objective implies that matrix
              inversion and/or eigen  decomposition operations are highly undesirable. In
              this context,  the core subject of this investigation is the development and 
              analysis of inductive, conditional optimization procedures in the  form of a
              sequence of weighted auxiliary vectors that are  orthonormal to each other and
              to the joint space-time vector  direction of interest.
