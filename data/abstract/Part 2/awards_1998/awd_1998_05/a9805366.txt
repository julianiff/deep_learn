Abstract    :
              Algorithms on graphical structures play a central role in both  communications
              technology and formal verification.  Minimal  trellises are graphical
              representations of error-correcting codes  that have emerged as a unifying
              framework for understanding and  manipulating codes of all types.  Ordered
              binary decision  diagrams and their variants are graph-based data structures
              for  representing Boolean functions that have found widespread use in  formal
              verification for a range of problems, including circuit  checking, logic
              synthesis and test generation.  This project  builds on the close
              correspondence that has recently been  established between the code trellis and
              binary decision diagram,  and investigates the transfer of ideas between these
              previously  disparate fields.  The fundamental challenge that confronts both 
              uses of graphical methods is the same: devise techniques to  combat the
              exponential blowup in the size of the graph.  The  research is
              interdisciplinary, and can be expected to have a  broad range of application,
              both within coding and verification,  as well as to such areas as artificial
              intelligence, database  search, and combinatorial optimization.
