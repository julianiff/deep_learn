This research deals with the nature of the rupture process of
              large earthquakes whose low-frequency behaviors have been found to be
              anomalous.  The investigation will use teleseismic data from high-performance
              global seismic networks.  The approach will combine into a single inversion
              scheme the information from two complementary procedures: a time-domain
              methodology for estimating the spatial locus of moment release as a function of
              time, and a spectral methodology for estimating low-degree polynomial moments. 
              The first uses broadband body waves to get high spatial and temporal
              resolution, while the latter uses low-frequency surface waves and free
              oscillations to place precise integral constraints on the entire source
              process.  The specific objectives of the project include the study of the
              source complexity associated with three classes of anomalous events: slow
              earthquakes on the oceanic ridge-transform system, intermediate-focus
              earthquakes with large CLVD (volume change) components, and complex earthquakes
              of long duration in continental crust.  This research is a component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
