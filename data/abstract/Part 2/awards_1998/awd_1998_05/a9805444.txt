Abstract    :
              9805444  Coe   Paleomagnetic data is a primary source for spatial configurations
              of continental blocks through time.  In order to fully utilize this database
              for geodynamic history reconstructions, these data must be available for all
              continental blocks involved in the reconstruction project.  Paleomagnetic data
              from Cambrian, Devonian, Triassic and Cretaceous rocks from the Siberian
              Platform are inadequate, that compromising reconstructions of these ages that
              involve the Siberian Platform.   This project will collect samples and attempt
              to determine robust paleomagnetic data from these rocks.  Results are expected
              to improve the geodynamic history for these times that include the Siberian
              Platform.
