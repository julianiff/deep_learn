This research addresses a broad range of questions
              related to earth structure and the nature of earthquakes.  3-D velocity
              structure inversion methods will be tested for the influence of uneven ray-path
              distribution.  3-D splines will be used to join high-resolution models to
              global models. Work will continue on the mapping of anisotropic structure in
              the lithosphere and asthenosphere.  A refinement will be done of the mapping of
              topography for the 410 and 660 km discontinuities.  The spatial variation of
              anisotropy in the inner core will be investigated, especially with respect to
              its influence on estimates of the super-rotation of the inner core.  For
              earthquakes, the widely used CMT (Centroid Moment Tensor) analysis and "Quick
              CMT" determination and dissemination will be improved and expanded to
              multiple-event/smaller earthquake capability, and the low-frequency earthquake
              source spectrum inversion techniques will be improved.  This research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
