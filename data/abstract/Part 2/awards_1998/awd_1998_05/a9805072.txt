Fluid exerts significant mechanical and chemical effects on
              virtually all crustal processes.  Tectonic deformation and fluid transport are
              coupled in a complex manner.  This is a proposal to initiate an experimental
              program to investigate the relationship between deformation and transport
              properties of
crustal rocks.  Experiments will be conducted to investigate
              stress-induced dilatant and compactive deformation and its influence on the
              electrical and hydraulic transport properties.  The stress-induced
              microstructure will be characterized quantitatively, and network models will be
              developed to simulate the evolution of transport properties with deformation. 
              Electrokinetic phenomena associated with the coupling between fluid flow and
              electric field will also be investigated.  The overall objective is to
              establish dynamic links between the evolution of transport properties and the
              micromechanics of failure in crustal rocks.  The scientific results are of
              importance in geophysical applications ranging from the near-surface
              prospecting for oil and minerals through deeper crustal sounding to study the
              dynamics of seismogenic, volcanic and geothermal systems.
