Abstract    :
              9805306  Meert  The assembly of a supercontinent of most of the earths crust,
              called Rodinia, was in the process of beak up from 1100 to 540 Ma.  There are
              several breakup models, and paleomagnetic data are important in tracking the
              path of individual fragments, thus testing these models.  This project will
              attempt to obtain accurate paleomagnetic data for the neoproterozoic of
              Madagascar, where essentially no data currently exists for this time interval. 
              Results are expected to contribute to resolution of break up models for
              Rodinia.
