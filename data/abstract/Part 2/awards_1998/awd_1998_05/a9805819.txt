Abstract    :
              9805819  Colley  This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for
              Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program as a Research/Educational
              Enhancement project.  The PI will use her POWRE award to undertake a three-part
              project: (i) to use and extend techniques from quantum cohomology in order to
              develop a "higher order" contact cohomology that will enable the computation of
              new characteristic numbers (involving incidence, tangency, and higher-order
              tangency) for algebraic plane curves and possibly for curves lying in other
              varieties; (ii) to connect ideas from commutative algebra with those of modern
              intersection theory in order to understand the algebra and geometry of blowup
              schemes along arbitrary centers(i.e., not necessarily nonsingular or reduced);
              (iii) to develop a course for undergraduates in computational algebra and
              algebraic geometry.    Topic (i) represents joint work with Gary Kennedy of the
              Ohio State University and Lars Ernstrom of the Royal Institute of Technology,
              Stockholm.  The idea is to develop an associative family of products,
              parameterized by the Chow ring of suitable variety, that deforms the cohomology
              cup product.  Topic (ii) is joint work with Gary Kennedy that would unite some
              local algebraic work with global geometry.  Topic (iii) will enhance the PI's
              teaching expertise and enable undergraduates opportunities for individual
              exploration and research.  This POWRE project is supported by the MPS Office of
               Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
