Abstract    :
              Abstract - Darrell Pepper          CTS 980-5480        The proposal is to
              partially support attendance at the International Conference ENVIROSOFT 98
              which will focus on computational techniques applied to environmental studies. 
              The conference will assemble scientists and engineers working in fields
              requiring computational methods in environmental transport and diffusion.  The
              conference is directed towards exchanging technical expertise, identifying the
              state of the art, and the projection of future needs and capabilities in the
              areas of species transport and environmental fluid flow.  The technical papers
              will be published in a bound Proceedings.
