Abstract    :
              This project request travel support for 15 participants from U.S. universities
              in the Student Paper Competition at the 1998 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave
              Symposium (IMS).
Each year, the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society
              promotes student education in microwave theory and techniques through the
              number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper
              Competition at the IMS. This selective program brings the world's best students
              together in an integrated program in which they present their work not only to
              a technical audience but again to a group of judges.  The program helps develop
              the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation
              skills.   It also helps introduce then to the international technical community
              and helps to build a community students who will lead the next generation of
              microwave engineers.
The IMS provides financial support of various forms but
              does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that
              the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S.
              Universities.
