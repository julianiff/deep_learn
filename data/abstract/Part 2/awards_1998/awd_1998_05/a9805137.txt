Abstract    :
              9805137  Hall   Dating movement on specific faults is a pervasively important
              datum in many geologic investigations, however such information most commonly
              be obtained indirectly.  This problem is particularly difficult in the brittle
              field as a few isotopic-based systems are active.  This proposal tackles dating
              of brittle faults that produce a transient, fault-generated friction melt.  The
              idea is to determine a methodology to obtain an 40Ar/39Ar age from
              pseudotachylite that avoids many of the potential errors (inclusion of
              un-melted source material, inequilbrium in melt and recoil loss effects during
              analysis, among others).   If successful, such a protocol would have broad
              utility in projects requiring knowledge of the timing of brittle fault
              movements.
