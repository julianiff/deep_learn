Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS-9805896    Principal Investigator:  C.
              Steiner    A POWRE Award.  The proposal is to study the self-assembling of
              amphiphilic molecules on surfaces in a variety of configurations: monolayers,
              bilayers, hemimicelles.  The work will concentrate on two equilibrium surface
              phases, liquid condensed and liquid expanded and will focus on two dimensional
              assemblies of binary mixtures of surfactants on hydrophobic substrates. 
              Fluorescence microscopy will permit direct visual observation of the domain
              structure, infrared spectroscopy to provide information about the average
              thickness and composition of the surface layer, and atomic force microscopy to
              determine the orientation of the molecules.  The information will be used to
              understand the relationship between the characteristics of the absorbed layer,
              structure and composition, and the desorption kinetics of self-assembly.  This
              POWRE award will enable the PI to initiate research in a new discipline and to
              take advantage of related state-of-the art technology.
