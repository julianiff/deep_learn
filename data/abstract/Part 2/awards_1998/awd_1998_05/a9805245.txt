This research involves efforts to improve estimates of the
              inner core's rate of rotation with respect to the rest of the solid Earth. 
              This project is a continuation of the original research that led to the
              discovery the inner core super rotation.  A search will be made for more
              seismograms in the critical distance range of 147-155 degrees for paths making
              an angle less than about 40 degrees between the Earth's north-south spin axis
              and the ray within the solid inner core.  Another search will be made for
              earthquake doublets in the critical distance regions.  Doublets have identical
              wave patterns and can therefore be used to give high-precision differential
              travel-time measurements.  Modeling will be done to investigate the range of
              structures that produce observed, low-amplitude PKIKP early arrivals associated
              with ray paths close to the fast axis in the inner core.
