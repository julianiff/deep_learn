Fossils that document the first 85 percent of the history of
              life are predominantly microscopic.  Only in the last 544 million years have
              the remains of large animals and, later, plants become abundant, leading
              geologists to christen this interval the Phanerozoic Eon -- the age of visible
              life.  The key event that connects these strikingly different eras is the
              evolution of complex multicellularity.  Multicellular organisms arose at least
              six times in animals, fungi, and several groups of algae.  A handful of fossils
              suggest that multicellular red, green, and stramenopile (brown and related)
              algae existed a billion years ago.  Multicellularity may have arisen comparably
              early in tiny ancestral animals, but until now any pre-Ediacaran animal record
              was thought to be inaccessible to paleontologists.

A remarkable fossil
              deposit is now shedding unprecedented new light on the early diversification of
              multicellular organisms.  Phosphorites of the 600-550 million year old
              Doushantuo Formation, China, contain three-dimensionally preserved fossils that
              record of early life yet discovered in Precambrian rocks; indeed, they must
              rank among the most important fossil deposits of any age.

A two-year
              research project is proposed to investigate the systematic paleontology and
              paleobiology of multicellular fossils in the Doushantuo phosphorites.  In
              collaboration with Professor Zhang Yun of Beijing University, the research team
              will collect large volumes of material from localities that our previous
              research has shown to be fossiliferous.  New, potentially productive4
              localities will also be sampled in the field.  Samples will be prepared in the
              laboratory and studied by light and electron microscopy.  It is anticipated
              that this research will provide a new empirical, paleontological framework for
              understanding a major transition in the history of life.
