Subduction of oceanic crust is a major factor controlling arc
              magmatism, crustal growth and the recycling of volatiles and other elements
              into the mantle. Subducted components in the sub-arc mantle have principally
              been studied using variations in the abundance and isotopic composition of
              minor and trace elements that are highly concentrated into fluids and silicate
              melts. Oxygen isotope variations should provide complementary constraints due
              to the isotopic contrast between crustal and mantle oxygen and to the simple
              relationship between variations in oxygen isotope ratio and the relative
              abundances of crustal components in the sources of mantle derived lavas.
              Previous laser fluorination and ion microprobe oxygen isotope data suggest that
              mantle melting in subduction zone environments is a sensitive function of the
              abundance of a 'slab' derived hydrous fluid, providing an unusual and concrete
              link between geochemical tracers of subducted materials and the petrogenesis of
              arc-related lavas. Building on these results this study includes investigations
              of: [1] the oxygen isotope variability in arc-related lavas from highly
              depleted sources and from arcs with trace element evidence for a large 'slab
              melt' component, [2] the existence of highly depleted, high delta 18O mantle
              peridotites suggested to exist by our data for arc lavas, and [3] siliceous
              melts in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc and elsewhere. This research
              has the potential to yield significant new insights into the role of crustal
              recycling in the genesis of arc-related lavas.
