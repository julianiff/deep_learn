The project involves the synthesis and properties of
              transition metal systems with layered and framework structures.  Three areas
              are proposed for study:  1)  asymmetric layer structures;  synthesis of new
              compounds in thin film and single crystal form, and full characterization of
              their physical (e.g., optical) properties;  2)  synthesis of structures with
              open frameworks for sorption using approaches based on both hydrothermal
              synthesis and coordination chemistry;  3)  the utilization of
              electrocrystallization under hydrothermal conditions (a new synthesis
              technique) for the preparation of  new compounds and thin crystalline films. 
              Layered compounds with asymmetric layers that pack without a center of symmetry
              between adjacent layers are extremely unusual.  They are particularly
              interesting because of their potential to exhibit nonlinear optical properties.
               The further development of the synthesis of open framework structures with low
              framework densities will be focused on structures that are topologically
              related to the structure of Niobium Oxide.  Two different approaches will be
              used to construct these large frameworks, one based on coordination polymers
              and the other on metal phosphates.  The area of electrocrystallization under
              hydrothermal conditions offers unusual opportunities for the synthesis of new
              compounds in the form of polycrystals, single crystals and thin films.

The combination of new synthesis techniques and new strategies for building
              inorganic frameworks will undoubtedly lead to new families of compounds, some
              of which it is anticipated will have new and unusual physical properties or
              chemical activity.
