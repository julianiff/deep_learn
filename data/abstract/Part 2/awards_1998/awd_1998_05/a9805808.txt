Abstract    :
              Berner  9805808      The activities to be undertaken in this Research
              Enhancement POWRE  project include learning new methods at an external site,
              perfecting the  new methods at the home institution, applying the new methods
              to the PI's  research program, and forging a new collaborative relationship
              with  colleagues at another institution. Academic year 1998-99 is the
              sabbatical  leave year of the P1. The PI will spend one semester in the lab.
              The  purpose of the trip Is two-fold: to learn the new lab methods which will 
              broaden the PI's research' program and to solidify a developing  collaborative
              relationship. The PI will spend the second semester  perfecting the techniques
              at the home institution with the animal models  commonly used in the PI's lab.
              Upon working out the methods in the home  lab, the PI will begin applying the
              new methods to the ongoing research  project of the P1. The PI will involve
              undergraduate in this part of the  project and the 'proposal includes summer
              salary for two students for the  summer, This proposal is particularly suited
              to a POWRE award. It makes  possible significant professional advancement of
              the PI by broadening the  scope of the research project through learning new
              methods, and it  increases leadership opportunities by providing funding for
              undergraduate  research. Completion of these activities would not be possible
              without  funding from the NSF which provides necessary salaries and supplies,
              and  the ability to dedicate time to these activities.
