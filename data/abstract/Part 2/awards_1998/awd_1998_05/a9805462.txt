Abstract    :
              The Chinese rural family has been characterized as an obstacle to economic
              development because its patriarchal authority pattern and interlocking
              obligations seemed to limit entrepreneurship. Recently the extraordinary
              economic performance of Chinese society has led social scientists to challenge
              this view.  This pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist will carry
              out ethnographic fieldwork in three rural villages in northeast China.  Using
              participant observation, formal and informal interviews, a formal questionnaire
              and several systematic data collection techniques such as free lists, pile
              sorts, ratings and rankings, as well as documentary research methods, the
              investigator will analyze the changing meanings of private lives of individual
              family members.  The project will yield information about the shifting role of
              the family in both the public and private spheres and its relation to state
              policies and the local political economy, a systematic exploration of the
              increasing importance of sentiment, intimacy, privacy, and individual autonomy
              within the Chinese rural family and the changing meaning of private life for
              individual villagers. In the future the project will be expanded with Chinese
              colleagues to study similar issues of family change and private life among
              family firms in a fast-growing rural market town.  This research will support
              the beginning research career of a young social scientist, and will advance our
              understanding of changing social life in the largest, most dynamic society in
              the world today.
