Abstract    :
              9805721  Waxman, Ronald  Association for Computing Machinery    Special Project:
               U.S. Attendance at the 15th IFIP World Computer Congress (WCC '98)    This
              award provides partial support for 15 representatives from the U.S. to attend
              the 15th IFIP World Computer Congress in Vienna, Austria, and Budapest,
              Hungary, August 31-September 4, 1998.  The International Federation for
              Information Processing (IFIP) is a multinational federation of technical
              organizations concerned with information processing.  The Federation on
              Computing in the U.S. (FOCUS), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE
              Computer Society, serves as the U.S. representative to IFIP and is
              administering this project.  The participants in the project are selected on a
              competitive basis by a committee of reviewers, with emphasis given to young
              researchers doing outstanding work and to applicants who have been accepted to
              present papers or are otherwise significantly involved in the conference.
