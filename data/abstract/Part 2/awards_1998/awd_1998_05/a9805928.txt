Abstract    :
              9805928  McGlathery  Estuaries and shallow lagoons are the link between
              terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems and receive considerable external inputs of
              nutrients and organic matter. Excess inorganic nutrient loading from coastal
              watersheds has been directly related to increases in primary production and to
              changes in habitat structure and trophic dynamics in receiving waters. By
              comparison, little is known about the cycling and bioavailability of organic
              nutrients in nearshore systems, even though organic nutrient inputs to these
              systems can sometimes be higher than inorganic loadings. This POWRE award
              focuses on dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a potentially important
              component of the nitrogen cycle in shallow coastal waters. Coastal lagoons and
              bays constitute a major type of land margin ecosystem on most continents, but
              the retention and transport of nutrients through these systems have received
              far less attention than in large estuaries. A major difference in the nitrogen
              cycling processes between these systems is the large influence that benthic
              primary producers have on nutrient transformations in shallow coastal lagoons
              and bays. Exchanges across the sediment-water interface play a key role in
              nutrient cycling in lagoonal systems because the water column is well-mixed and
              small in volume relative to the large sediment surface area. A combination of
              field observations, laboratory experiments and numerical modeling will be used
              to test hypotheses regarding interactions between and among organic matter
              load, flux of DON, and benthic plants. The results will aid our ability to
              predict both the consequences of different loading regimes to coastal lagoonal
              systems and the effectiveness of possible mitigation efforts to reduce the
              effects of eutrophication in shallow coastal systems.
