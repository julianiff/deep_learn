The absence of historically observed obsidian dome eruptions
              limits efforts to constrain the flow behavior of high-silica lavas.  This
              project is an investigation of microstructural evidence of flow dynamics in
              Late Holocene (less than 2000 years old) obsidian flows in California and the
              Pacific Northwest.  Drill cores obtained from the Inyo Domes Research Drilling
              Project in California preserve a nearly pristine record of microscopic textural
              and structural evolution of the dike, vent, and subaerial regions of the
              Obsidian Dome system.  An innovative technique to measure the three-dimensional
              orientations of microlites (small crystals) will be employed. These
              measurements, combined with theoretical models, provide a framework for
              determining the relative timing of degassing, crystallization, and flow
              advance. Three-dimensional orientations can be used to infer conditions of
              flow, for example, the type of flow (pure versus simple shear), the amount of
              strain, and the strain-rate.  For example, preliminary measurements of
              microlite orientations from Little Glass Mountain agree well with theoretically
              predicted orientation distributions of rods in simple shear flows. This project
              will yield information that will assist in assessing volcanic hazards
              associated with obsidian dome eruptions.
