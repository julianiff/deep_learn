This project will use both conventional microsampling
              techniques, together with new in situ laser ablation techniques to obtain high
              precision and resolution isotope data on mineral phases, and to thereby
              significantly improve our understanding of magmatic differentiation. The simple
              principle of crystal isotope stratigraphy (CIS) is that crystals growing in a
              differentiating open magma system record secular changes in the isotope
              composition of the liquid from which they crystallize.  When combined with
              textural and mineral composition data a detailed history of differentiation can
              be reconstructed. This philosophy will be developed in two closely related
              investigations; 1) an examination of the layered cumulate sequence from a
              contaminated and recharged magma chamber at Rhum, Scotland, and 2) detailed
              studies of the dated eruption products of open system differentiation at
              Ngauruhoe volcano, New Zealand.  The first study will allow examination of a
              far more protracted and complete differentiation history than is represented by
              volcanic rock suites, while the second, by virtue of the excellent time
              constraints, may enable calibration of open system differentiation through
              time.
