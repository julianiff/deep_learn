The chemical evolution of igneous rocks is fundamentally a
              process of crystal-liquid segregation. The objective of this research is to
              develop and extend a numerical approach to multiphase crystallization that
              explicitly allows for relative motion between crystals and melt simultaneously
              in the interior of the magma body and the boundary layers at the roof, walls
              and floor. This will include many processes that are central to geological
              applications such as thermal and compositional buoyancy, variable viscosity,
              kinetic effects of solidification and melting, crystal settling, crystal plumes
              and instabilities, compositional convection in regions of crystal mush, and
              entrainment of crystals from magma chamber floors. Some of the model is already
              implemented but important features relating to the details of nucleation and
              eutectic behavior and to variable rheological properties and functions require
              further refinement. Specific applications of this model to the cooling and
              dynamics of mid-ocean ridge basaltic systems and to systems involving mixing
              and disruption of cumulate piles by convective activity will be explored.
