Abstract    :
              9805029  Ward   The Cordillera of western North America is composed of an
              amalgamation of tectonic terranes, attached at various times onto the stable
              North American craton, after being transported variable distances from their
              origins.  This transport and amalgamation history is not well known and has
              given rise to several conflicting ideas.  These proposals address two important
              but conflicting and mutually exclusive hypotheses, namely whether the Insular
              superterrane, presently in western British Columbia, originated in the
              Cretaceous north of California (no or small northward movement) or from far to
              the south, near Baja California.  The work will be a careful reassessment of
              prior data and the assumptions underlying those data.  Results are expected to
              help resolve the important controversy about the origins of the Insular
              terrane.
