Abstract    :
              9805792  Ashby  Temperature has a pervasive effect on many aspects of
              physiology. Most organisms have evolved adaptations in response to their
              thermal environment, including thermoregulatory strategies which minimize
              internal variation in body temperature in the face of large environmental
              temperature fluctuations. Body temperature affects many traits important to
              fitness, such as developmental rate, mass, metabolic rate, egg production, and
              courtship. Despite its obvious importance, very little is known about the
              genetic determination of body temperature and thermoregulation. Investigations
              into the evolution of thermoregulation will not be complete without an
              understanding of the genetic control of body temperature. The purpose of this
              POWRE award is to determine the feasibility of conducting a quantitative
              genetic study of on the genetic control of preferred body temperature. To
              estimate heritability of preferred body temperature, artificial selection
              experiments will be performed on laboratory populations of a grasshopper
              species. Metabolic rate, mass, and developmental rate will be measured and
              genetic correlations with preferred body temperature will be conducted. The
              results of this research will provide the first estimate of heritability of
              preferred body temperature in an insect, and these results can be used to
              assess metabolic efficiency of wild populations of insects. This information is
              important given the economic effect of insects on crop plants world-wide.
