Abstract    :
              9805613  Ambegaokar  Theoretical research will be conducted on (i) the 
              superconductivity of disordered wires, including the  resistive transition and
              the explicit role of the electron-  phonon interaction and disorder in the
              suppression of  superconductivity; (ii) anomalies in the resistive behavior  of
              normal and supeconducting point contacts; (iii)  techniques for calculating the
              properties of inhomogeneous  disordered superconducting systems; and (iv) the
              loss of  quantum coherence in disordered mesoscopic systems.  %%%  Theoretical
