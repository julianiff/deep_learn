              and MEMS    Combining rapidly evolving technologies -- MicroElectroMechanical
              Systems (MEMS), distributed robotics, and biotechnological systems -- to create
              large collections of autonomous, intelligent micro-machines offers new
              capabilities that can be exploited for a variety of useful purposes.  By
              merging sensing and actuation with computation and communication, MEMS devices
              can be distributed throughout the environment, coated on surfaces, or embedded
              within everyday objects to create distributed systems for sensing, reasoning
              about, and manipulating events in the physical world on a scale never before
              possible.    A primary component of this research is the exploration of how to
              program massively-parallel MEMS microactuator arrays.  Drawing on biological
              inspiration, arrays of artificial flagella and cilia provide actuation in the
              form of manipulation or locomotion. Asserting a coordinated effort by the
              aggregate array requires addressing the parallel actuation of individual
              robotic agents.    The impact of a postdoctoral candidate includes: (1) new
              designs and processes for massively-parallel MEMS devices, (2)
              biologically-inspired systems and devices to implement massively-parallel
              manipulation and locomotion, and (3) control software and algorithms for arrays
              of artificial flagella and cilia. Experiments will be performed to validate the
              theory. This work is interdisciplinary, combining results from computer
              science, biology, and engineering.
