                                This research will examine the extents of devolatilization or
              retention of volatile components in deeply accreted rocks as functions of P-T
              history deep in forearcs. This integrated field, petrologic and geochemical
              work will concentrate on suites for which previous detailed petrologic and
              thermochronological studies have provided constraints on prograde and
              retrograde metamoprhic evolution, and will focus on selected voaltile
              components for which subduction cycling is expected to be important. The
              evidence for varying degrees of volatile loss will be linked with present
              mineraology and inferred prograde metamorphic reaction histories. The reserach
              will also provide information regarding the degree to which low-T, high-P/T
              metamorphic suites preserve a record of the isotopic compositions and sources
              of high-P/T fluids, the extents of deep pore water subduction, and the scales
              of fluid mobility at depth in forearcs. The field areas will include the
              Western Baja Terrane and parts of the Fransciscan Complex. The second task will
              be studied in selected exposures in the Coast Ranges.
