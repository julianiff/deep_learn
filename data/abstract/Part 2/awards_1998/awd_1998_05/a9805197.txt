Burgdorfer
	The projects under study, the dynamical evolution of
              Rydberg atoms excited by ultrashort electric fields, the non-radiative
              recombination of Rydberg atoms in a low temperature magnetized plasma and
              electron scattering in semiconductors heterostructures have a common theme and
              goal.  The need to understand the complex dynamics of simple systems subject to
              strong perturbations and the connections and correspondence between classical
              and quantum dynamics.
