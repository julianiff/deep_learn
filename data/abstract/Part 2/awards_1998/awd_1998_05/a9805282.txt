Abstract    :
              9805282
Prewitt/Hazen/Finger
The dynamic history and present state of the
              Earth's interior result from properties of earth materials; detailed
              understanding of earth processes depend fundamentally on structural
              characterization of these materials at high pressures and temperatures. The
              Geophysical Laboratory has been a pioneer in developing techniques for in-situ
              diffraction studies on both single crystal and powder samples under extreme
              conditions. A recent NSF equipment grant supporting the purchase of a new
              diffractometer with a CCD detector will enable us to measure full
              three-dimensional diffraction patterns of very small crystals, determine the
              nature of a range of defects affecting crystal properties, and to collect data
              rapidly at a series of increasing/decreasing pressures and/or temperatures. 
              Specific experiments will focus on structure investigations of silicates,
              oxides, and sulfides, hydrogen bonding models for dense hydrous magnesium
              silicates, cation ordering in multi-cation oxides, and various analog compounds
              that can provide information about earth processes and materials. We will also
              continue to provide facilities and support to outside investigators who want to
              conduct crystallographic experiments, especially at high pressures and
              temperatures.
