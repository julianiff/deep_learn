Abstract    :
              9805021  Harry   This project is an ambitious attempt to model several aspects
              of the compressional mountain building process, especially the causes of late
              stage syn- and/or post-orogenic extension, the partitioning of transpressional
              displacement into strike-slip and dip slip components, and on developing a
              basis for interpreting rock displacement histories from geologic and
              geophysical observations.  The work involves a series of Finite Element models
              in first 2-D and then expanded to 3-D followed by testing and application to a
              number of orogens, including the Ouachita and Brooks Range.  Results are
              expected to help understand structural response to prolonged oblique
              convergence in orogenesis.
