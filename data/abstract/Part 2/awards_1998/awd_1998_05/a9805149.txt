This research involves the study of the crust and upper mantle
              of the region encompassing southeastern California and western Arizona, which
              covers the southwest quarter of the Colorado Plateau and much of the southern
              Basin and Range.  An existing data set from a 75-station, 200km by 450km array
              will be analyzed to complete a seismic tomography study, incorporating modeling
              of available digital Bouguer gravity data, and to model existing broadband
              waveforms to characterize the upper mantle structure in the study region.  This
              important data set fills a large gap in high-resolution P-wave tomography
              coverage for the western U.S.  The region's Cenozoic tectonic history of
              transition from subduction related compression and crustal thickening to
              orogenic collapse with core complex formation, volcanism, and extension is
              unusually well documented in the geologic record.  This study will constrain
              the present day composition and physical state of the upper mantle beneath the
              area to evaluate the ways it has retained, or lost, the imprint of the Cenozoic
              tectonic events.
