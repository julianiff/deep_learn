This project is a continuation of a long-term NSF-sponsed
              effort to measure the present-day motion of the Caribbean plate and to
              determine the manner in which rigid plate motion is accommodated along the
              Caribbean-North America plate boundary near Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.  The
              objectives include: 
(1) Construction of a Caribbean plate kinematic model
              using GPS-derived velocities from sites that span the Caribbean plate and to
              use the same velocities to test for non-rigidity of the Caribbean plate; 
(2)
              determination of how Caribbean-North America motion is partitioned by the
              faults that separate the two plates in the vicinity of Hispaniola and Puerto
              Rico, and ultimately, to extract information about the dynamics of this plate
              boundary by modeling elastic strain and extracting block rotations from the
              velocity field; (3) determination of the slip rate and level of elastic strain
              accumulation along the Septentrional fault in northern Hispaniola, which has
              not experienced a major earthquake in more than 700 years despite geologic
              evidence for significant slip over the past several thousand years. 
              Occupations in 1986, 1994, and 1995 of a GPS network spanning the
              Caribbean-North America plate boundary have set the stage for determinations of
              site displacements that should resolve these questions, and sufficient time has
              now elapsed so that additional measurable (ranging from 10-100 millimeters)
              displacements have occurred within the exisiting network.  The proposed work
              will include a reoccupation of the existing sites as well as densification and
              modest expansion of the network.
