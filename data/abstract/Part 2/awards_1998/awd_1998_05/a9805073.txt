Abstract    :
              9805073  Armstrong   Thermochronologic data from a number of techniques has the
              ability of defining the times given rock samples went through a set of mineral
              closure temperatures.  These data, with a number of assumptions, are used to
              interpret parameters such as uplift rates, tilting and erosion.  However, many
              of these interpretations are controversial due to ambiguities in the
              assumptions used in the inversion.  This project will approach this problem by
              developing a detailed thermal model to simulate exhumation across active normal
              faults, that will produce temperature-time paths for rocks at actual sample
              sites in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.  Results should indicate how transient,
              non-horizontal closure temperature isotherms should be used to interpret
              thermochronologic data.  A successful outcome should produce rules for improved
              interpretation of fission track and other thermochronologic data.
