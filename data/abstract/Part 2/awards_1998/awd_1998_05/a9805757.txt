This project will support the participation of
              researchers from 
the United States at the Third Americas Conference on
              
Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis to be held at the 
Georgia
              Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia from 
September 9-13, 1998.  The
              emphasis of this meeting will be 
on applications of modern dynamical systems
              theory to 
problems in science and engineering.  The objective of the
              
conference is to maintain and foster research interactions in 
these fields
              between researchers from countries in the 
Americas.  The conference will
              focus on applications of 
nonlinear oscillations, infinite dimensional
              dynamics, phase 
transitions, lattice dynamics, mathematical biology, and
              
computational dynamics. The workshop will bring together 
researchers from
              the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Canada, 
and other countries in the
              Americas. The program will include 
invited lectures, contributed talks, and a
              poster session.
