Partial melting experiments on a thick flood basalt flow
              have revealed that a remarkable 3-D network of plagioclase-crystal chains is
              present when the lava is no more than 25% crystallized. Once formed, this
              network allows compaction of the crystal mush to take place in the lower third
              of the flow and the expelled liquid moves upward into the central part of the
              flow where it accumulates as horizontal sheets of differentiated liquid.
              Deformation of the network resulting from compaction is measured from 3-D
              models constructed from serial sections through partially melted basalt
              samples. These measurements provide the first direct means of determining the
              amount of compaction occurring during solidification of an igneous body. The
              main goal of the continued research program is to determine how this compaction
              takes place in the simplest of igneous bodies - a thick, ponded lava flow. This
              will be done by determining how the deformation of the plagioclase network
              varies with height in the flow and with flow thickness. This information will
              be combined with existing chemical data to create a quantitative model for
              crystal-mush compaction and resulting magmatic differentiation. Although this
              study will be carried out on a surface lava flow, the results will have wide
              application to much larger and more complicated magma bodies within the
              Earth.
