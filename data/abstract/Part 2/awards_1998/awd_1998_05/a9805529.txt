Abstract    :
              HRD-9805529  P.I.:  Robles, Carlos  Inst.:  California State LA University     
              California State LA University will establish a regional Center for
              Environmental Analysis  (CEA-CREST) focussed on research and education.  The
              Center will collaborate  extensively with the University of California at Santa
              Barbara and several other schools  in the region.  Nine Principal Investigators
              from three departments will cooperate to  investigate four different, but
              correlated, areas of environmental impact.  An  excellent  existing outreach
              program for minority students will be further enhanced, and  undergraduates
              will be employed on each of the research projects.
