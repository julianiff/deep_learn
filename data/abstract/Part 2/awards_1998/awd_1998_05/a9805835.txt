Abstract    :
              9805835  Hu  The long-term objective of this project is to develop a method of
              directing nerve axonal growth within three-dimensional matrices for tissue
              engineering applications.  To facilitate the selective deposition of
              biologically active molecules in a three-dimensional structure, a photochemical
              technique will be employed that relies on a penetrating laser to spatially
              control the binding of bioactive molecules.  This method can be applied to
              deposit virtually any molecule that can be conjugated to a photolinker.  The
              immediate objective of this project is to apply the developed method to
              investigate the factors critical to path finding in both two-dimensional
              surfaces and three-dimensional structures.  ***
