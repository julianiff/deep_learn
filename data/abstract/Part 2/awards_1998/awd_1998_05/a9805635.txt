Abstract    :
              9805635

Despite significant research and development efforts, usage of
              partially restrained (PR) principles has been very slow in coming to the
              marketplace.  This is clearly and primarily caused by a lack of understanding
              and appreciation of the applications of PR principles on the part of designers,
              but also due to the lack of suitable software. Practical implementation of the
              use of PR connections in structural systems by designers is a real possibility,
              but to get to that stage requires a well-planned technology transfer effort. 
              For this workshop, Lehigh University will work with the Structural Stability
              Research Council (SSRC) to conduct a one-day workshop on the topic of frames
              with partially restrained connections.  The focus of the workshop will be to
              assess state-of-the-art research and research needs in the subject area,
              examine criteria for design specification development, and develop and
              recommend implementation and technology transfer into practice.  The workshop
              will be held in Atlanta, Georgia on September 23, 1998.  Workshop topics
              include:  1) frame stability; 2) connection performance; 3) influence on
              seismic effects; 4) analysis and design technologies; and, 5) practical
              implementation and technology transfer.
Presented papers and reports of
              discussion sessions will be published
in a set of proceedings by
              SSRC.
