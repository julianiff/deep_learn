Abstract    :
              9805555  Gilman  This award provides partial support of the core programs of 
              the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) of the  National Research
              Council.  ILAR has played a key role in  developing and disseminating
              guidelines for care, breeding and  use of animals in research since 1952.  Its
              core activities  include publication of the quarterly ILAR journal, provision 
              of information about animal care through web pages, online  databases and
              printed publications, and the planning of  special projects such as the
              periodic revision of the Guide  for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, a
              standard  reference for those responsible for the quality of animal care 
              practices.  Other core activities include periodic meetings of  the ILAR
              council which is composed of experts in the use of  animals in research who
              serve on a voluntary basis.
