Abstract    :
              9805324  Pollard   Joint surfaces may exhibit features indicative of various
              details of brittle failure, but these are not commonly exploited in structural
              analysis.  This project will produce these features under laboratory conditions
              in an attempt to provide new interpretative tools for field geologists to
              constrain tectonic loading, strain rates and cyclic loading.  Results,  if
              successful and scaled to actual examples would be of utility in brittle-field
              deformation studies.
