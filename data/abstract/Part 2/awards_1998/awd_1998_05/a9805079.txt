We request one year of funding to complete a study of the
              relationships between granites and the mafic rocks (diorites and gabbros)
              commonly accompany them in continental arcs.  In many arcs granites bear a
              strong isotopic resemblance to coeval mafic rocks, suggesting that the two
              suites are linked by a differentiation process such as fractional
              crystallization or partial melting. Remelting of mafic lower crust is one way
              (but not the only way) to generate granitoid magmas with mantle-like isotopic
              characteristics.  We have undertaken a study of the dehydration melting of
              hornblende gabbros and diorites with variable K2O contents to investigate the
              origin of granitoid magmas of the Sierra Nevada batholith and elsewhere. 
              Melting experiments at 8 kilobar pressure on Sierran mafic rocks have
              successfully produced silicic to intermediate liquids similar in composition
              (including K2O and Na2O) to common I-type granite and granodiorite.  We request
              funding to complete this study.  Work to be performed will include further
              electron microprobe analyses of synthesized mineral phases and glasses, ion
              microprobe analysis of experimental glasses, and geochemical modeling to test
              the hypothesis that the granites could be derived by melting of mafic lower
              crust.
