This research involves a continuation of the study of
              seismicity in coupled subduction segments and their surroundings (overriding
              plate, sea floor and subducting slab) to understand the strength and
              heterogeneity of coupling along the thrust interface.  Specific areas of
              investigation are: 1) investigation of the relations between heterogeneous
              seismic coupling along the main thrust zone and seismicity in the sea floor and
              upper plate areas; 2) explanation of seismicity in the descending slab at
              intermediate depths and its relation to coupling; 3) correlation of seismicity
              with changes in a Coulomb measure of stress change (shear minus friction
              coefficient times normal stress change) in a subduction zone and its vicinity;
              and 4) investigation of compressional earthquakes in zones near the trench and
              towards the outer rise as signals of the maturity of the earthquake cycle of
              the thrust interface.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.
