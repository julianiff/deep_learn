Difference equations (i.e. recurrence equations) have a
              number of properties in common with differential equations.  The PI recently
              introduced the notion of finite singularities of difference equations.  With
              this notion, more methods for differential equations can now be applied to
              difference equations, and this leads to new algorithms.  In particular, the PI
              intends to implement a new efficient algorithm for computing hypergeometric
              solutions of recurrence equations.  These algorithms have several applications,
              such as finding and proving formulas, or solving certain linear differential
              equations.
