Abstract    :
              9805138  Magloughlin   Dating movement on specific faults is a pervasively
              important datum in many geologic investigations, however such information most
              commonly be obtained indirectly.  This problem is particularly difficult in the
              brittle field as a few isotopic-based systems are active.  This proposal
              tackles dating of brittle faults that produce a transient, fault-generated
              friction melt.  The idea is to determine a methodology to obtain an 40Ar/39Ar
              age from pseudotachylite that avoids many of the potential errors (inclusion of
              un-melted source material, inequilbrium in melt and recoil loss effects during
              analysis, among others).   If successful, such a protocol would have broad
              utility in projects requiring knowledge of the timing of brittle fault
              movements.
