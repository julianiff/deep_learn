              Animation of Human Motion with Experimentally Determined   Parameters   
              Despite significant recent progress, creating believable animations of human
              motion remains a difficult task. One potential solution to this problem is to
              use control systems coupled with dynamic simulations of the human body to
              generate motion. The proposed research seeks to increase the realism of
              simulations by adding stylistic components to such motions as running and
              gesturing.  These components will be extracted from experimental motion capture
              data of human actors and used to drive physically realistic simulations of
              humans.  The postdoctoral associate will also explore whether the introduction
              of noise into a simulation enhances the appearance of the resulting motion. 
              Noise characteristics will be experimentally quantified by asking test subjects
              to view animated sequences.  A theoretical analysis of the simulations should
              determine a priori bounds on the amount of variation that can be added to a
              simulation without causing instability.  The postdoctoral associate brings a
              strong background in control as well as expertise in motion capture experiments
              to the project.  The knowledge gained from analyzing human motions and the
              introduction of noise into the motion will increase our understanding of how
              people move and may lead to applications in physical rehabilitation and sports
              medicine.
