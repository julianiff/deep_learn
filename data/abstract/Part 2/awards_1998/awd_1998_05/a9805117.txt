Abstract    :
              The 6th conference of the International Federation of Classification
Societies
              (IFCS) will be held in Rome, Italy, July 21-24, 1998. 
IFCS consists of the
              classification societies of North America,
Great Britain, Italy, France,
              Germany, Belgium/Netherlands, Portugal,
Poland, Japan, and Korea. While the
              various member societies differ
in emphasis and philosophies, they share a
              common interest in problems
of classification, cluster analysis, and data
              analysis in such areas
as biology, library science, statistics, medicine,
              social science, 
psychology and philosophy. 

This proposal will provide
              grants to help defray the cost of travel 
for approximately 5 U. S. citizens
              or permanent residents to 
participate in this conference. Grants under this
              proposal will be
limited to the approximate cost of airfare. This support will
              encourage
those who might not otherwise be able to attend IFCS 98, junior
              faculty
in particular, to become part of the international community
              of
researchers in the fields of classification, clustering, and
              data
analysis, and to become aware of the many alternative philosophies,
uses
              of, and approaches to data analysis and classification-related
problems in
              particular.
