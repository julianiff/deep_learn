Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of  
              California at Los Angeles supports the research of Professor Sarah   Tolbert. 
              The theme of the research is the study of kinetic factors   controlling
              stability in ordered silica/surfactant mesostructured   composites under
              hydrothermal conditions.  These new materials consist of   an organized organic
              component, which controls long-range periodicity,   and an inorganic framework,
              which provides stability and strength.  If   the organic component is removed,
              phase transitions in the ordered   mesoporous material produced can be followed
              in real time to gain insight   into the kinetic factors controlling structure
              to reveal the interplay   between organic packing constraints and the rigid
              inorganic silica   framework.  Real-time X-ray scattering and solid-state NMR
              spectroscopy   are used to follow both structural change and silica framework  
              condensation.  The results of the experiments in this project will provide
              information   that can be directly used in new syntheses of silica/surfactant  
              composites.  The ultimate goal of this work is to learn how to form new  
              composite or mesoporous structures for specific applications, such as  
              catalysis or chemical sensors.
