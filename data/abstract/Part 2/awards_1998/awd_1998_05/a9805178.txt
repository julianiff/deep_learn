              Abstract  ATM-9805178  Nicholson, Sharon E.  Florida State University  Title:
              The ENSO Signal in Botswanan Rainfall and Anticipated  Impacts of the Current
              ENSO Event    ENSO events are usually associated with drought in much of
              Southern  Africa.  One of the areas most strongly affected is Botswana where 
              rainfall was 40 to 80% below normal during the 1991/92 ENSO  episode. 
              Preliminary work shows that the association between ENSO  and rainfall in
              Southern Africa is more complex than the simple  occurrence of drought. 
              Although droughts commonly occur during  ENSO episodes, early in many episodes
              there is actually an increase  of rainfall in some regions and not all ENSO
              events are associated  with droughts.  This SGER award supports research to
              better  understand the sequence of rainfall response within the current  ENSO
              episode and the conditions under which a given ENSO event  evokes a
              precipitation signal over Southern Africa.  The sequential  development of ENSO
              episodes also appears to have changed since the  late 1970's, when a general
              warming occurred in the world's oceans  and the current ENSO appears to be
              taking a somewhat different  course than other intense events.  The on-going
              ENSO event will be  used to address the nature of these events and the
              character of the  paleoclimate signal evoked.
