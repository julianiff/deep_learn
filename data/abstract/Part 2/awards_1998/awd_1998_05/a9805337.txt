Abstract    :
              9805337  Rowley   The presence of coesite-and diamond-bearing assemblages in
              eclogites from an increasing number of orogenic belts suggests that the
              exhumation of ultra-high pressure (burial depths 90-120 km) rocks is not a
              unique event in the geologic record.  However, the mechanisms and the time
              scale over which such exhumation takes place remain incompletely characterized.
               This project is aimed at improving the understanding of the kinematics and
              timescales for exhumation of the Dabie/Tonghai ultra high pressure assemblages,
              which may involve large scale extensional tectonics.  Two recently discovered
              very large displacement candidate normal faults will be examined for
              displacement same, offset and age of movement.  Results will be compared to
              timing of ultrahigh metamorphism to test several hypotheses about uplift and
              exhumation mechanism in orogens.
