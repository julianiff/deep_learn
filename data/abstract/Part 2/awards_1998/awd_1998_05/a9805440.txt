Abstract    :
                9805440  Gerardi  The National Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the 
               National Research Council's Ocean Studies Board, will   produce two documents
              in its series Beyond Discovery:  The   Path from Research to Human Benefit that
              relate to ocean   science research.  Funds will be used to support the  
              development, production, dissemination of 10,000 copies, and   posting on the
              Internet of two topics in the Beyond   Discovery series.  The two topics on
              research related to   ocean sciences are on  El Ni o and sea floor spreading.  
               Submission of this proposal and selection of the topics are   timely, owing to
              the United Nation's having declared 1998 as   Year of the Oceans (YOTO).  The
              Beyond Discovery series is   intended to identify and trace the origins of
              important   recent scientific and technological advances and to reveal   the
              crucial role played by basic research, the applications   of which could not
              have been anticipated at the time the   original research was conducted.
