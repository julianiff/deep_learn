Abstract    :
              9805542  Launchbury, John  Oregon Graduate Institute    PostDoc: Verification of
              Microprocessor Microarchitectures    Under the Post-Doctoral Research
              Associateship methods are being developed for verifying concurrent properties
              of microprocessor microarchitectures, such as liveness and sequential
              equivalence. Existing verification techniques are being adapted, integrated and
              evaluated in the context of the Hawk microarchitectural specification language.
              The objective of this research is to demonstrate that the use of design
              abstraction enables formal verification technology to be used to verify
              significant properties of complete microarchitectures. This work blends with
              parallel research on further developing the Hawk language implementation, and
              on using Hawk to specify realistic models of commercial microprocessors, with
              all their accidental complexity.    The Hawk language provides abstractions
              that make explicit much of the information that is needed for this purpose, and
              the cleanliness and compactness of Hawk specifications provides powerful
              leverage on the verification problem. In particular, Hawk specifications avoid
              much of the detail of typical logic-level specifications. Further, Hawk's
              declarative nature provides it with great potential for formal manipulation.
              New, hybrid verification technology is being built by combining an appropriate
              temporal logic with model checking. The temporal logic is used to express the
              concurrent property of interest, and models are constructed automatically by
              abstract interpretation of Hawk specifications.
