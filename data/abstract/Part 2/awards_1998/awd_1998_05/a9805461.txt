Abstract    :
              9805461  Ruppel   The volcanoes of Late Proterozoic to middle mesozoic age along
              the circum-Atlantic produced one of the earth's most a really extensive large
              mafic volcanic occurrences.  Recent work has indicated that much of this mafic
              magmatism was emplaced over only a few million years.  This collaborative
              project will focus on an incompletely studied portion of the mafic volcanic
              province, and will attempt to test the timing constraints and to apply the
              results to various models for the driving forces for the Pangean rifting event
              that produced the present day Atlantic Ocean.
