     The investigator studies the structure of closed
              circular
DNA.  The theoretical approach employs displacement-based
              Finite
Element Analysis (FEA), a well-established technique for
obtaining
              solutions to engineering problems in nonlinear solid
mechanics.  FEA is used
              to describe closed DNAs containing
multiple coplanar bends that are in-phase;
              containing bends that
do not lie in the same plane; and containing  bends
              distributed
both symmetrically and asymmetrically.  It is predicted that
              the
twist distribution is uniform throughout the regions between the
bends;
              that the fraction of the linking number change converted
into writhe increases
              with the number of bends; and that the
regional contribution to the writhe
              increases if the bends are
clustered in that region.  Finally, it is predicted
              that the
equilibrium configurations of DNA containing multiple bends
              fall
into two distinct classes of writhe behavior, depending on the
ratio of
              the elastic moduli and the number of bends, and that the
initial supercoiling
              process is completely different for the two
different classes.  Biologically,
              closed circular DNA is one of
the most important structural forms of DNA. 
              This includes not
only free DNA molecules, such as the plasmids used in all
              genetic
engineering experiments, but chromatin as well, which is now
known to
              be divided into domains of supercoiling.  Bent regions
in DNA appear to be
              significant in regulating the initiating of
transcription.  This project
              provides the physical basis for
understanding the combined effects of these
              two structures.
     DNA not only is a repository for genetic information
              but
also is involved in many aspects of the expression of this
information. 
              For example, it is often necessary to bring
together portions of the DNA
              molecule that lie at considerable
distances from each other along the DNA
              contour.  This
juxtaposition of distant genetic elements makes possible
              the
expression of biological information that is not otherwise
possible. 
              This process is accomplished by forming a loop, in
which the two elements that
              are to be brought together interact
at the site of loop closure.  The bringing
              together of these
distant genes depends in a sensitive way upon the length of
              the
DNA piece that separates them, upon the helical periodicity, and
upon the
              salt concentration of the cell in which the DNA resides.
This project shows
              how the presence of internal bends in DNA
within the loop fundamentally
              changes how distant segments are
brought together.  The distribution of these
              internal bends can
thus have profound biological consequences.
