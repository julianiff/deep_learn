Science Education and Systemic Change: The Challenge of
              Sustaining Reform, focuses on the question of how to maintain the gains of an
              initial educational change process and support continuing reform over time. 
              Within the broader study of sustainability, the research pays particular
              attention to the systemic approach to science education reform as well as the
              role that external funds can play in initiating reforms that are sustained. The
              goal of this study is to identify and document factors in school systems that
              contribute to sustained educational change.  The purpose is to provide
              districts now engaged in improving their science education programs and
              districts that are considering doing so in the future, with information that
              can help them more strategically and effectively build an infrastructure for
              long-term improvement. Specifically, this study focuses on nine communities
              with K-6 science education programs begun 10 to 30 years ago.  These
              communities differ in their sources of funding as well as the longevity of
              their programs.  This study investigates how and the extent to which these
              communities have sustained their science education programs and the factors
              that have contributed to this sustainability.
