This two-year award supports US-France cooperative
              research on ultrafast lasers between the NSF Science and Technology Center for
              Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan, directed by Gerard
              Mourou, and the Laboratory for Applied Optics at the French National Center for
              Scientific Research.  The objective of the research is the development of a
              100-terawatt tabletop system based on chirped-pulse amplification of Kerr-lens
              modelocked laser pulses.
 
The project involves the exchange of US and French
              postdoctoral scientists.  The US group will focus on high peak power, spatial
              and temporal beam quality and investigate new amplifying media.  This is
              complemented by French research on harmonic generation with good efficiency. 
              If a novel source is developed, it will have several important applications for
              basic science in the areas of Wakefield acceleration of electrons, and in short
              wavelength light generation.
