Work will continue on assessing the quality of the biotic and
              environmental information that can be preserved in the fossil record.  Research
              will focus on a field area that has proven an especially productive "natural
              laboratory": the northern Gulf of California.  Paleoecological and geochemical
              approaches will be developed to:
    (1) Estimate changes in productivity. 
              Changes in productivity will be estimated through the analysis of changes in
              growth rates and carbon isotope composition in bivalve mollusk shells.  Shells
              dated from before the diminution of the Colorado River's flow (in about 1935)
              are expected to reflect the higher productivity of the northern Gulf of
              California that resulted from the river's input of nutrients.  Such techniques
              may be applicable to other areas and to pre-Holocene coastal environments.
   
               (2) Establish guidelines for restoration of habitats altered by human
              activity.  Diminution of the River's flow has altered the Delta's salinity,
              sediments, and fauna.  The living shelly fauna will be compared to the shelly
              remains to document the faunal changes.  One species, the bivalve Mulinia
              coloradoensis is now confined to a relict population in the River's mouth,
              whereas it formerly occurred in great abundance throughout the Delta.  Analysis
              of oxygen isotopes from dated shells of this species may indicate the minimum
              influx of river water needed to restore populations of this and its associated
              species.  This technique may be of use in other coastal habitats altered by
              human activity.
    (3) Reconstruct the paleohydrology of the Colorado River. 
              Oxygen isotope variation will be used to document the variation in the
              discharge of the Colorado River during the past 2,000 years.  Use of stable
              isotopes from dated Mulinia coloradoensis shells will permit an independent
              estimate of river discharge in close proximity to the river's mouth, where
              other species are rare.  Techniques developed for estimating the Colorado's
              paleohydrology may be used in other settings to provide proxy estimates of
              virgin river flow during the late Holocene.
