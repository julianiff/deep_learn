Abstract    :
              9805876  O'Connor    The Smithsonian Institution will develop plans for Science
              on the Mall.  The final product of this planning will be an exhibit with a
              traveling component and additional complementary activities that will heighten
              the public's understanding of the processes of science.  It is the
              Smithsonian's intention that visitors will experience the processes of science
              by direct inquiry into the nature of science as a way of thinking and knowing
              the world.  With this award, they will plan the 8000 sq. ft. permanent exhibit,
              a smaller scale traveling exhibit, various public programs, and an Icon.  The
              large exhibit will consist of five stations: What is Scientific?,  How is
              Science Done?, What Influences Have Tool and Instrumentation Had on Science?,
              How is Science Used?, and How is Science Communicated?.  Managed by the Office
              of the Provost, the planning activities will include 1) meetings of SI staff
              and advisors that have diverse perspectives including scientists, educators,
              exhibit designers, and evaluators, among others; 2) charettes on the exhibit
              design and visitors perceptions and expectation of science issues, 3) the
              drafting of concepts and text for the exhibit activities, and 4) final review
              of all elements by SI management.  At the end of the planing period it is their
              intention to have all the plans in place in order to move forward on the
              implementation phase.
