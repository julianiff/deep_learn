Abstract    :
              Branching morphogenesis, the creation of a hollow tree of
branched ducts from
              an initially simple structure, is a robust,
important, and widely studied
              model system in developmental
biology.  There is a large body of experimental
              results on what
is and is not required to generate the glandular structures,
              but
there is as yet no single theory which ties together all that is
known
              about branching morphogenesis.  The two main existing
theories hypothesize
              that the origin and direction of branching
activity rest solely in,
              respectively, (1) the epithelium, and
(2) the mesenchyme.  This study proposes
              a new hypothesis, that
activity in (3) both tissues is essential.  This study
              will
develop a mathematical model of the forces and deformations
involved in
              branching morphogenesis, using a multiphase for
mulation to track changes in
              the density of cells, extracellular
matrix components, and interstitial fluid.
               The model will be
analyzed, using asymptotics, perturbations, bifurcation
              analysis,
parameter estimation, and numerical simulation.  The first
              task
will be to evaluate the agreement of the model with experimental
facts,
              and the second will be to help answer some long-standing
questions,
              specifically the relative mechanical roles of the
epithelium and the
              mesenchyme.  Specific predictions will be
made, that others may test them
              experimentally.  The primary goal
of this project is to distinguish between
              the three major
theories of branching morphogenesis mentioned above.  It is
              very
likely that the insights gained from this modeling study of
branching
              morphogenesis will lead to a better under standing in
general of the physical
              forces in confluent (epithelial) and
sparse (mesenchymal) tissues, both in
              homeostasis and in
development, with applications and insights in other
              contexts
such as somitogenesis, tooth and hair formation,
              angiogenesis,
healing, and tumor growth.  The study will also lead to
              an
improved understanding of the multiphase models of biological
tissues
              which have been developed in other contexts, through
extending these passive
              models to tissues which are actively
growing and remodeling.
     The
              formation of branched tubular structures occurs
throughout an organism, in
              many different tissues, and is
essential to the very existence of large
              organisms which need to
transport fluids more than a short distance. 
              Branching
morphogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in animal
              development,
generating the form of such organs as the lung, mammary
              gland,
salivary gland, and kidney.  Although nearly every technique
              of
cellular and developmental biology has been applied to it, and
much has
              been learned from these experiments, there is still
uncertainty as to the
              mechanism of branching.  The overwhelming
majority of experiments on branching
              have concentrated on
biochemical aspects, following the dominant paradigm
              in
biological research of the last few decades.  Yet the essence
              of
morphogenesis is that tissues grow and move and change shape, and
this
              requires physical forces to emerge from the molecular
biology.  Hence the next
              logical step in morphogenesis research
is study of the biomechanical aspects,
              which are what create and
modify form.  A mathematical model will be developed
              of the
mechanical forces and resulting material deformations of the
tissues
              involved in morphogenesis.  Analysis of the model will
(1) allow a comparison
              of the biomechanical aspects of the
currently competing theories of branching
              morphogenesis, (2) lead
to greater understanding of the relatively new
              modeling
methodology itself, which is useful in many other
              biological
applications, and (3) suggest new interpretations and
              experiments
towards the goal of understanding one of the most
              important
phenomena in developmental biology.
