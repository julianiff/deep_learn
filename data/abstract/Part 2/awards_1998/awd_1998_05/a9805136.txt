Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Gender Dynamics and Subsistence Systems in Circumpolar Societies: An
              Ethnoarchaeological Interpretation    Building on the authors' previous study
              of gender dynamics and subsistence practices in Chipewyan communities in the
              Canadian subarctic, this ethnoarchaeology  project extends the analysis to
              other societies in the circumpolar north: (1) Saami reindeer herders of the
              Kultima area of the Finnish arctic; (2) Khanty fisher-hunter-trapper-herders of
              the Trom'Agan area of the western Siberian subarctic; and (3) Inupiaq maritime
              hunters of Little Diomede Island in the Alaskan arctic.  Methods in this
              comparative study include interviews, participant observation, and settlement
              mapping.
