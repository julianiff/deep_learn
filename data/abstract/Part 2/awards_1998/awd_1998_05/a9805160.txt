Abstract    :
              9805160  Shervais    This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              acquiring a  Philips PW2400 x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. This instrument 
              will be used to perform major and trace chemical analyses of bulk  rock samples
              in support of NSF-funded research projects in the  Earth Sciences by the PI and
              other investigators at the  University of South Carolina, and by investigators
              at other  institutions in the southeastern region, including Clemson, the 
              College of Charleston, Benedict College, Centenary College, and  the Savannah
              River Environmental Sciences Field Station. Projects  supported by NSF which
              will use this instrument include  investigations of plume-related volcanism in
              southern Idaho,  ophiolites (ocean crust) in the Coast Ranges of northern 
              California, arc volcanism and associated mineral deposits in  Kohistan
              (Pakistan), volcanic and plutonic rocks of the Carolina  terrane and other
              exotic accreted terranes in the southern  Appalachians, and eclogites and
              related high-P granulites of the  central Carolina Piedmont. In addition to the
              co-investigators of  this grant (Shervais, Dennis, McGee), the University of
              South  Carolina has just hired two new faculty members in the area of  orogenic
              systems (James Knapp and Matthew Kohn) who will use this  instrument in their
              research.  ***
