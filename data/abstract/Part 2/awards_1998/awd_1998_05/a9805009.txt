Abstract    :
              9805009  Bickford   This project is an attempt to follow the process by which
              collisional orogens become cratonized.  The study will focus on plutons and
              paragneisses from the internal subdivision of the Trans-Hudson orogen.  The
              project will benefit from the Canadian Lithoprobe Seismic transect and will
              involve extensive isotopic age dating using minerals with various closure
              temperatures.  Results will allow construction of time-temperature cooling
              curves for the several terranes and the bordering Archean cratons.
