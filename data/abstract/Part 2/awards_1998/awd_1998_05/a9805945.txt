Abstract    :
              
This project initiates further research on the fields of distance
graphs and
              the channel assignment (also named T-coloring).  Both
fields have been active
              research areas for years.

There are two major components in this project. 
              The first one
extends research on problems on distance graphs and
              T-coloring
and their connections.  The first connection between
              distance
graphs and T-coloring was proved by the PI [1997] and was used
              to
obtain extend solutions on a problem on distance graphs raised
and studied
              by Eggleton, Erdos and Skilton [1985].  A joint work
with Chang and Zhu [1997]
              completely solved the problem and
proved the second connection which showed
              that the fractional
chromatic number of a distance graph is equal to its
              asymptotic
T-coloring ratio.  The latter parameter was shown, by Griggs
              and
the PI [1996], to be closely related to an earlier number theory
problem,
              namely, density of sequences with missing differences,
studied by Cantor and
              Gordon [1975] and by Haralambis [1977]. The
project will follow this direction
              of research to explore other
useful connections between distance graphs and
              T-coloring, to
obtain further results on distance graphs including
              their
chromatic number, circular chromatic number and fractional
chromatic
              number, and to study a generalization of the problem of
Eggleton, Erdos and
              Skilton.

Motivated from practical situations in the channel
              assignment
problem, several variations of T-coloring have been studied. 
              The
second part of this project will extend the research of the PI's
past and
              current work and joint work on two variations of
T-coloring, namely, no-hole
              T-coloring and distance two labelings
of graphs.  Research on the distance two
              labelings will also
benefit the practical two-level-interference channel
              assignment
problem.
