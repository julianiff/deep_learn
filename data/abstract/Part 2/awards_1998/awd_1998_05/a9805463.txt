A RIE machine with an option to perform electron cyclotron
              resonance (ECR) plasma etching is key to the materials and device processing
              from SiC, BN GaN and related III-V nitride films.  This system is necessary for
              the realization of many projects in the Departments of Electrical Engineering,
              Materials Science Research Center of Excellence, Chemistry, Chemical
              Engineering and Physics, and will act as a catalyst for research in other
              departments as well at Howard University.  The availability of the proposed RIE
              machine will specially assist the teaching and research activities of the newly
              established Materials Science and Engineering Program (MSEP).  Among the
              devices to be realized are A1GaN/GaN and InGaN/GaN double heterojunction
              photodetectors employing conventional and resonant cavity enhancement designs. 
              Moreover, GaN quantum well lasers and LEDs as well as A1GaN and BN
              homojunctions intended for Deep UV detection will be explored.  The objective
              would be to explore improved dry etching processes for devices with materials
              combinations that can yield strains advantageous for right kind of carrier
              transport in p-i-n diodes.  The main thrust of proposed research would also be
              to investigate and utilize RIE technique for the fabrication of new
              semiconductor heterostructure devices with improved optical, electrical and
              structural characteristics.  Efforts would specially be directed towards
              exploring new epitaxial wide bandgap semiconductor device concepts, and towards
              developing a laser and a photodetector technology base for sensors for
              commercial and military applications.
