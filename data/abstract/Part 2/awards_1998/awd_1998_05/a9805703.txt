              Computing Research    DNA as a computing medium gives unprecedented massive
              parallelism and storage.  These capabilities are to be exploited in three
              research goals. (1) Develop new algorithms using moderate amounts of DNA, in
              contrast to current algorithms which require excessive quantities of DNA.  (2)
              Design algorithms to use practical, realistic laboratory methods that will
              allow scaling up to the large problems of interest in computer science.  (3)
              Apply DNA Computing to NP-hard problems.    This Postdoctoral Research
              Associateship will advance the above goals by providing a broadening
              interdisciplinary experiences in (1) Seeking new algorithms for DNA Computing
              that can ultimately solve problems too difficult for conventional computers. 
              (2) Interacting with molecular biochemists on the feasibility and demonstrating
              these algorithms. In the context of this DNA computing research, the Research
              Associate will help to advance the current state of DNA Computation.  A new
              algorithm for the Directed Hamiltonian Path problem is to be implemented.  The
              Research Associate will refine the algorithmic techniques to be used,
              specifically revising them to be feasible in laboratory demonstrations.  The
              anticipated overall result of the research will demonstrate the feasibility of
              scaling up DNA computation to problems larger than those previously addressed.
