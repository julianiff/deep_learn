Abstract    :
                                KASTENS  9805727    This award supports research experience
              for students who are in training to become science journalists.  The students
              are master's degree candidates in a dual master's degree program in   "Earth
              and Environmental Science Journalism".  This two-year program combines the
              resources of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the Department of Earth &
              Environmental Sciences, and the Graduate School of Journalism, all of Columbia
              University.  The program's overarching goal is to train print, broadcast and
              new media journalists who will report news pertaining to the Earth or
              Environment in a manner that is interesting, insightful, and accurate.    In
              addition to formal coursework in science and journalism, all E&ESJ students are
              required to compete an extensive scientific research project, which they write
              up as a master's paper and defend to a faculty committee.  The research can be
              conducted at any of the research centers that have faculty affiliated with the
              Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences: Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,
              the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERC), Goddard
              Institute for Space Sciences (GISS), the American Museum of Natural History, or
              Biosphere 2.  The best way for prospective journalists to learn what science is
              all about is by doing real science, with their own hands and brains.
