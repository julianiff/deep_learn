Abstract    :
              9805878   Spiegel  The 1998 Gordon Research Conference on Glycolipid and
              Sphingolipid Biology will be held January 11-16, 1998, at Ventura, California.
              The purpose of the conference is to encourage the transfer of ideas and
              information within the community of scientists who work at the forefront of
              glycolipid and sphingolipid research, an area long recognized as important for
              many biological processes, such as cell-cell recognition, cell-substratum
              adhesion, extracellular matrix function, transmembrane signaling, immune
              regulation, and differentiation of all cells in tissues and organisms. Glyco
              and sphingolipids are important lipid constituents of all eukaryotic membranes.
              Recently, it has become increasingly evident that functions of glyco and
              sphingolipids reside not only in their complex structures but also in their
              metabolic products. Much attention has been focused recently on the
              sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate,
              which are emerging as a new class of lipid second messengers involved in cell
              growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. An important aspect of the Gordon
              Conference on Glycolipid and Sphingolipid Biology is that it brings together
              scientists who work in different disciplines. Because of its breadth, the
              Sphingolipid and Glycolipid Biology Gordon Conference has continued to play a
              seminal role, despite the proliferation of subspecialty meetings. A broad range
              of speakers and participants have been sought for the 1998 Conference,
              particularly graduate and postgraduate students, women and minorities. 
              Conferees are encouraged to participate both in the formal lecture/discussion
              sessions, and less formally in poster presentations.  The platform sessions
              cover all the leading edge research topics in glycolipid and sphingolipid
              biology (e.g., structural biology, trafficking and subcellular localization,
              molecular aspects of glycosyltransferases and hydrolases, gene targeting
              approaches to glycolipid and sphingolipid biology, ceramide and apopto sis,
              with special emphasis on signal transduction). Approximately 140 foreign and
              domestic scientists will attend the meeting and many of the conferees will be
              graduate students or postdoctoral fellows.
