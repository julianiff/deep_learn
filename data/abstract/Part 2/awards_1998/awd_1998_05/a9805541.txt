Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Nesbitt will use IR laser absorption methods to study the
              spectroscopy and dynamics of transient species expanded in a supersonic slit
              nozzle.  He proposes using a slit jet discharge to study highly reactive
              radical species using direct IR laser absorption.  In addition, he will
              investigate large amplitude vibrational dynamics of highly fluxional jet-cooled
              molecular ions and neutral clusters, and proton transfer dynamics in ion
              clusters.  To support the experimental studies, Nesbitt proposes to carry out
              quantum variational calculations to interpret the large amplitude dynamics and
              test ab initio potential energy surfaces for these species.

The
              determination of potential energy surfaces provides the information needed to
              understand and control the course of a chemical reaction.  Professor Nesbitt's
              studies will provide quantum state and reactant approach geometry information
              for an important class of chemical reactions known as heavy-light-heavy
              reactions.  The information obtained from this work will be an important step
              towards using lasers to control the outcome of chemical reactions.  The
              information from this project is also important in understanding chemical
              combustion, atmospheric chemistry and plasma diagnostics.
