We proposed to determine the diffusion kinetics of Sm, Nd and
              other selected REE in garnet (Ce, Gd, Yb) and clinopyroxene (Ce, Yb), and also
              of Hf in garnet as functions of T, P and fO2. The diffusion experiments will be
              conducted by tracer isotope techniques, and the induced isotopic profiles will
              be analyzed primarily by depth profiling in an Ion probe (SIMS).If the
              budgetary constraints, the anisotropic diffusion tensor of clinopyroxene will
              be determined following established procedures, which should yield fundamental
              insight about the diffusion mechanism. The diffusion data will be applied to
              model the dynamic evolution of REE in igneous rocks, which are products of
              partial melting of the Earth's mantle, accounting for the kinetics
              of
incorporation of the trace elements from the solids into the partial melt.
              The Hf diffusion data will be applied to the interpretation of the Hf isotopic
              data in the Precambrian granites and rhyolites in terms of the involvement of
              garnet in the source region.Theoretical formulation will be developed for the
              closure temperature of slowly diffusing trace components in minerals, and to
              relate their cooling ages to the cooling rates, and applied to the Sm-Nd and
              Lu-Hf decay systems in garnet.
