This U.S.-Czech research project between Nicholas
              Farrell of Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, and Viktor Brabec of
              Institute of Biophysics, Brno, features detailed structural examination of the
              conformational changes induced in DNA by dinuclear and trinuclear platinum
              complexes.  The researchers intend to prepare site-specific DNA adducts of di-
              and trinuclear complexes and systematically examine their structure and
              conformational sequences.  Results are expected to produce a three dimensional
              picture of the structures of specific DNA adducts and to improve our
              understanding of the effect of DNA topology on its binding modes to platinum
              complexes and their recognition by specific proteins.  If successful, findings
              may be useful in refining a new class of antitumor agents.

This cooperative
              research project in biochemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
