Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT          Proposal Number:  CTS-9805938    Principal Investigator:
              C. Grant      A POWRE award.  The project involves a study of the deposition
              and removal of organic contaminants from solid surfaces.  Non-invasive and
              continuous measurements of the rate and extent of surface fouling and swelling
              and changes in the physical and chemical properties of the residues will be
              made.  Two types of  measurements will be made: the quantity of material
              removed by the solvent; the average amount of material remaining on the
              substrate.  These measurements will enable an in depth evaluation of the film
              properties at the molecular level and will increase the basic understanding of
              interfacial phenomena.  This POWRE award will enable the PI to initiate a new
              area of research and to use this research in developing educational materials
              in environmental engineering and pollution prevention.
