Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to design an efficient VLSI  implementation for
              certain algebraic geometry codes, to fabricate  a chip, and to identify
              applications where these codes would be  competitive.  The codes to be
              considered are Hermitian codes and  other codes similar in structure.  The
              advantage of these codes  is that, for a given symbol size, they are longer
              than Reed-  Solomon codes and can therefore take better advantage of the law 
              of large numbers to give much greater error correction  capability.  A number
              of decoding algorithms for these codes  exist, including those developed by the
              co-PIs.  We will combine  the best elements of these algorithms into an
              explicit  computational algorithm that is well suited to VLSI  implementation. 
              The goal is to produce a chip that uses parallel  processing, regular and
              simple structures, simple logic, and a  minimal number of iterations.  We will
              verify the logic design  using a VHDL simulation.  We will also identify
              systems where  these codes would be appropriate and test the performance of the
               decoder in channel simulations appropriate to those applications.
