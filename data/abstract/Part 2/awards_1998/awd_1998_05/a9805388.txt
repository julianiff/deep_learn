Abstract    :
              ***           9805388  Tavlykaev    The primary goal of the completed Phase I
              effort was to prove the feasibility of hig-reflectance low-loss silicon
              gratings on LiNbO3 waveguides.  We showed theoretically and demonstrated
              experimentally that a substantialperturbationof the effective mode index ina
              LiNbO3 waveguide can be achieved with a high-index Si overlay without
              increasing optical loss for the guided mode.  This phenomenon was used to build
              a high performance Si Distributed Bragg reflector with 80% reflectivity. 
              Subsequently, a narrowband asymmetric Fabry-Perot filter with electro0optical
              tunability was realized using a Si grating on a LiNbO3 waveguise. The filter
              was tested in a hybrid laser-filter module.    The developed technology of high
              performance DBR gratings using Si-on-LiNbO3 structures is useful in developing
              a variety of advanced devices, in particular, filters and compact waveguide
              laser sources, such as CW, mode locked, Q-switched, and tunable lasers.  These
              devices are sorely needed inthe cable and telecommunication industry,
              especially in WDM networks.    ***
