              Abstract  ATM-9805886  Wallace, John M.  University of Washington  Title:
              Climate Variations and Trends    This grant supports continued studies of
              weather and climate based largely on analyses of observational data.  The PI
              will (i) analyze interdecadal variations in surface air temperature and 
              precipitation as a means of determining whether and to what extent human
              activities are influencing climate; (ii) study the role of   equatorial
              asymmetries in the diabatic heating fields in setting up zonal sea-level
              pressure gradients along the equator in order to determine whether monsoon-like
              cross-equatorial flows could mediate polarity reversals of the Southern
              Oscillation; (iii) document the variability of land surface vegetation based on
              satellite imagery and relate the variability to climatic variables such as
              rainfall and daily max/min temperatures; (iv) determine the predictability of
              the circulation in specific weather forecast situations; and (v) develop and
              apply statistical methods for use in weather and climate research.    This
              research is important because it seeks to increase understanding  of important
              climate and weather processes and hence may lead to better predictions of these
              phenomena.
