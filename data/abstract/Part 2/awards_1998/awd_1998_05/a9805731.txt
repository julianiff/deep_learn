Understanding the mechanisms that control longevity,
              architecture, and sequence variability of carbonate platforms is of fundamental
              8importance in scientific studies of carbonate platforms as recorders of
              ancient environments and in hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation.  However,
              interpretations of internal facies architecture and sequence-stratigraphic
              correlation's of carbonate platforms are commonly based on an assumption:
              fluctuations in sea level are the essential controlling mechanism.

We
              propose a collaborative project between Universities of Kansas and
              Wisconsin-Oshkosh to evaluate the roles of both regional and local variables
              including sea-level changes, subsidence, tectonic activity, siliciclastic
              influx, excess nutrient flux, and carbonate production rates on platform
              architecture.  Evaluation of these controls will be accomplished through a
              comparative analysis of coeval Triassic platforms of various scales,
              architectures and settings distributed over an area of 650 kn2 within the
              Nanpanjiang Basin of south China.  We have chosen the Nanpanjiang Basin because
              we know of no other area that allows outcrop study of as great a diversity of
              platform scales and morphologies, including both landward-attached platforms
              and isolated platforms.

We will determine sequence-stratigraphic
              architecture from mapping outcrops that expose continuous two-dimensional
              transects through the platforms.  Comparison of synchronous intervals will aid
              in separating regional and local controls.  We will use detailed
              biostratigraphy and magnetic-reversal stratigraphy to ensure that synchronous
              events are evaluated in the separation and interpretation of controlling
              mechanisms.  With this stratigraphic and age data we will construct subsidence
              histories to isolate local variations so we can examine possible causes for
              synchronous differences in the stratigraphy between platforms or along strike
              within platforms.  For example, for coeval intervals with similar subsidence
              and eustatic histories we will use facies analysis to evaluate the impact of
              variables such as influx of siliciclastics or excess nutrients on interruptions
              or termination of carbonate platform growth and to evaluate the impact of
              basin-filling siliciclastics on progradation geometries.  The end product will
              be a series of depositional models that illustrate actual architectural
              variability in carbonate platforms and a quantitative understanding of the
              mechanisms that control variability.
