              PostDoc:  Verification Tool for Net-based Programming    This project is
              devoted to the development of effective automated techniques for modeling and
              reasoning about the correctness of network-based software. The motivation for
              the project arises from the exploding popularity of programming in net-based
              languages like Java coupled with the fact that an incorrectly functioning
              net-oriented program can inflict serious damage on a whole network and not just
              on a single site within the network.  The methods to be used by the research
              effort are based on those used successfully in the analysis of finite-state
              systems such as communications protocols and in the rigorous modeling of  
              programming language constructs.  The PI has substantial experience in the
              former but very little with the latter; the addition of a postdoctoral research
              associate with a background in the latter is therefore essential for the
              project's anticipated results---a collection of techniques, and associated
              tools, for analyzing automatically the safety and fault-tolerance of mobile
              code---to be achieved.
