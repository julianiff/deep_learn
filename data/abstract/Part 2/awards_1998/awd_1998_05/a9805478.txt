Abstract    :
              This project will study the social interaction in business and social settings
              in which people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds come together
              in two places in Southeast Asia, Yogyakarta, Indonesia and Kuala Lumpur,
              Malaysia. Building on a larger research and training project funded by the Ford
              Foundation, the project will carry out in-depth ethnographic research on the
              social resources for market and social participation in these two multiethnic
              urban environments. The project will study the role of middle-range businesses,
              religious organizations, and locally-based non-governmental organizations in
              fostering social pluralism and civic participation.  The investigator and local
              colleagues will conduct participant observation and in depth interviews with a
              range of participants in these social environments, focusing on activities and
              social contexts which affect, positively and negatively, the interaction of
              distinct ethnic and religious groups.  By studying situations where religious,
              ethnic, and economic divisions are full of tension as well as situations of
              novel initiatives to develop new structures of civility and participation, this
              sort of comparative ethnography will provide new knowledge to advance our
              understanding of the roots of democratic society, the broad-based participation
              and civil interaction of diverse ethnic and religious people.
