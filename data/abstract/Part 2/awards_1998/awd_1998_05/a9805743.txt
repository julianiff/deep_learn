              Computational Methods in VLSI Design    This research project will develop
              innovative computational methods and software for problems in electromagnetics
              arising in VLSI design. The project focuses on developing robust, effective,
              and parallelizable solvers and preconditioners for linear systems arising from
              finite element and boundary element modeling of inductive and capacitive
              effects in high speed integrated circuits. Techniques based on a hierarchy of
              representations using multipoles and block low-rank approximations of the
              coefficient matrix are investigated. The implications of these techniques for
              approximate inverse preconditioners and multilevel schemes for sparse solvers
              are also addressed. Portable parallel formulations of the techniques along with
              theoretical estimates for convergence and parallel performance are targeted. In
              addition to development of innovative techniques and training of the
              post-doctoral research associate, this project serves to strengthen the recent
              initiative in computational electromagnetics at Purdue University. The presence
              of a post-doctoral researcher in electromagnetics also complements the PIs'
              areas of expertise, contributing to the interdisciplinary nature of the
              project.
