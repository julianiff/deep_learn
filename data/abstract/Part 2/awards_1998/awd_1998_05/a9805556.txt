This project focuses on a study of what factors
              regulate the intracellular levels of a key metabolite for essentially all
              living organisms, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), using as a model system the
              photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1. ALA is the common
              precursor in the biosynthesis of such important biomolecules as heme, vitamin
              B12, and (bacterio)chlorophyll. R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 is a useful model because
              (a) unlike most prokaryotic organisms, it synthesizes ALA by the same
              condensation reaction, catalyzed by ALA synthase, between glycine and
              succinyl-CoA (Shemin pathway) used for ALA formation in fungal and animal
              cells, and it is the only prokaryote identified in which two genes (hemA and
              hemT) encoding ALA synthases are present, similar to the situation in higher
              organisms, including humans; (b) it synthesizes all of the ALA derivatives
              listed above; (c) its high metabolic versatility provides us with the ability
              to analyze how organisms sense and respond to their environment.
The
              significance and importance of understanding the regulation of ALA synthesis is
              of unquestioned value because it is central to the formation of heme (present
              in cytrochromes and hemoglobin) required for aerobic and anaerobic respiration
              as well as oxygen transport, and chlorophyll required for photosynthesis. These
              studies will provide insights into the control of ALA synthesis in R.
              sphaeroides 2.4.1, and thus how this organism can sense its needs for
              tetrapyrroles and respond accordingly to changes in its growth conditions. A
              better understanding of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in R. sphaeroides, will
              contribute to an understanding of tetrapyrrole synthesis in those organisms
              deploying the Shemin pathway.
