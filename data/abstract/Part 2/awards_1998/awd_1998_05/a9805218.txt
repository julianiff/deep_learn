                     DePaolo                                                                 
                                                                                             
                                The proposed research is designed to determine (1) the rates
              of mineral-fluid exchange reactions in metamorphic rocks at temperatures
              between 500 and 700 C and (2) the length scales over which chemical
              "equilibrium" is maintained during metamorphism under these conditions. The
              approach involves measurements of Sr, Nd and O isotopic compositions of garnet
              porphyroblasts from metamorphic rocks, combined with similar isotopic
              measurements of whole rock and matrix samples. The isotopic measurements will
              be supplemented with electron microprobe studies of major element compositions
              of minerals. The study will be made on samples from layered metamorphic rocks,
              the localities chosen specifically because they have characteristics which
              allow determination of the "equilibration length" or "reaction length" of the
              fluid-rock system. The required characteristics of the field sites are: (1)
              interlayered lithologies with different initial Sr isotope ratios and different
              Rb/Sr rations; (2) abundant large garnet porphyroblasts suitable for
              microsampling of core, rim, and intermediate zones for isotopic analyses; and
              (3) a relatively recent age of metamorphism. Appropriate outcrops have been
              identified in the Alps, Vermont, California and Alaska.
