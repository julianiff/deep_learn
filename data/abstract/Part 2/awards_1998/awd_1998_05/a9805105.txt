Abstract    :
              ***           9805105  Stewart    We propose to investigate and develop an
              imaging and spectroscopic.system based on ultra-wideband electric-field sensors
              that cover a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is generally
              inacessible by current spectroscopic techniques. The proposed device will be
              based on a new optoelectronic design  which is capable of time-domain
              far-infrared spectroscopy across a frequency range extending from near DC to
              several THz. The electric-field sensor system employs the Pockel's effect in
              electro-optic crystals. A pulsed microwave signal induces a transient
              polarization in the sensor crystal. This polarization is then probed by a
              synchronously pulsed laser beam, which projects the spatial and temporal
              electric-field distribution is projected onto a CCD camera. Our previous
              studies of these imaging sensors has demonstrated a sub-wavelength spatial
              resolution, femtosecond temporal resolution, near DC-THz bandwidth, sub-mV/cm
              field sensitivity, up to 100 Hz scan rate, and a signal-to-noise ratio better
              than 1,000,000:1. The electro-optic detection has a flat (nonresonant) spectral
              responsivity (from near DC to several THz), a large detector area (> 1 cm2),
              and an extended dynamic range (> 1,000,000). The simplicity of the detection
              geometry, capability for optical parallel processing, and excellent
              signal-to-noise ratio make this system suitable for real-time, 2-D coherent far
              infrared imaging applications.             Potential commercial applications
              include industrial inspection and process control, FIR spectroscopy, electric
              field sensor, and medical imaging.  ***
