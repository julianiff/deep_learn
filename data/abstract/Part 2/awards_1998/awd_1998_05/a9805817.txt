Abstract    :
              9805817  Hager, Gregory  Yale University    CISE PostDoc: A Compositional
              Approach to Vision-Based Manipulation    In robotic hand-eye coordination there
              is currently a gap between control-level visual servoing and high-level task
              specification.  The objective of the proposed research program is to bridge
              this gap in a principled yet practical manner.  The primary question to be
              studied is how and when a given complex manipulation task can be composed from
              simple provably correct control-level components in such a way as to guarantee
              correctness of task performance.  A related question is how large-scale motions
              can be divided up into smaller segments so that a homotopy method can be used
              to sequence these short visual servoing tasks.    Another objective of the
              proposed research is to develop methods for specifying hand-eye coordination
              tasks which are manipulator and environment invariant using object-attached
              coordinates. This approach to visual task specification is to be experimentally
              tested through implementation of a human-machine interface where the operator
              interactively specifies object-centered manipulation tasks.    The impact of
              this project is the realization of previous theoretical developments by the PI
              within the context of a large, complex hand-eye system.  These developments can
              in turn be expected to motivate additional theoretical and practical questions
              related to high-level specification of hand-eye coordination tasks.
