      Crustal
              extension in compressional orogenic belts has been shown to occur in several
              studies, but the controlling parameters and boundary conditions are not well
              understood.   This study will employ extensive 3-D modeling to attempt to
              determine how a set of tectonic parameters influence the inception and
              development of extensional collapse of orogens.  Results should help understand
              late-to-post-orogenic gravitational collapse.
