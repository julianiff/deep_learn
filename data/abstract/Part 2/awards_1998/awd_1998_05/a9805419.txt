Our laboratory study will quantify the dependence of the
              rate of diffusion of Fe-Mg on water concentration in olivine and
              magnesiowstite, two important mantle minerals.   One goal of our experiments is
              to develop relationships between cation diffusivity and water/hydroxyl
              concentration under well-defined thermochemical conditions.  For many nominally
              anhydrous minerals, a small amount of  water  significantly enhances
              diffusion-dependent properties. However, these observations are only
              qualitative: Does the presence of water result in an enhancement in the
              kinetics of a specific process ... yes or no?  Quantitative relationships
              between diffusivity and water/hydroxyl content have not been determined for
              either olivine or magnesiowstite. The results will be used in the context of
              point defect thermodynamics to gain a fundamental understanding of the
              mechanism(s) by which water influences transport properties such as ionic
              diffusion and electrical conductivity.  The resulting theoretical framework is
              essential for reliably extrapolating laboratory  results to mantle environments
              and for utilizing experimental observations to develop
models of the dynamic
              behavior and geochemical evolution of Earth s interior.
