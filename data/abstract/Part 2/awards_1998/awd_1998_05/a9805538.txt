              Experimental Research on Wireless ATM Network    This research focuses on
              investigating  extensions of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) signaling
              protocol to support connection hand-offs in a hybrid network environment. A
              hierarchical hand-off scheme is developed to support connection hand-offs for
              the integration of the wireless and wireline ATM networks. This hand-off scheme
              combines the clustering, the incremental connection re-establishment, and the
              virtual hierarchical network techniques to provide fast and efficient
              connection re-routings. A special mechanism is included in this scheme to
              reroute undelivered and mis-routed cells to their destination, which in turn
              reduces cell loss due to connection hand-offs. The hand-off procedure under
              consideration is evaluated by using two approaches. First, an analysis to be
              conducted presents the theoretical performance, determining metrics such as
              connection disruption time, buffer requirement, and cell loss rate. Second,
              experiments (via wireless devices and emulations) are to be conducted by using
              the High Speed Networking and Performance (HSNP) Laboratory ATM testbed.  This
              research is significant because it deals with key interoperability issues
              relating to wireless ATM networks. The Postdoctoral Research Associate will
              play a pivotal role in all aspects of this   project, including the
              experimental portion.
