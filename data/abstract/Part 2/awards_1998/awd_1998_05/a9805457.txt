Abstract    :
              9805457  Emslie    The award supports the travel expenses to bring six 
              established scientists, four graduate students and four  undergraduate students
              from the U. S. to a special symposium  on the conservation and ecology of
              seabirds of the southern  oceans. This symposium will be convened at the annual
               meetings of the Society for Conservation Biology, Sydney,  Australia, 13-16
              July 1998. A discussion session and  workshop will immediately follow the
              symposium and  facilitate greater interactions and new collaborations among 
              scientists and students from the United States with those  from Australia, New
              Zealand and other southern hemisphere  countries including Indonesia and the
              Philippines.  Funds  are included to invite four scientists and/or students
              from  the Philippines and Indonesia to attend. These countries  have growing
              conservation programs that include seabird  species. Participation by
              individuals from these programs  will enhance their knowledge on seabird
              conservation and  promote new collaborations. All participants in the 
              symposium and workshop will be invited to submit their  papers for peer-review
              and publication in a proposed special  volume of the Antarctic Research Series,
              to be published by  the American Geophysical Union in 1999. This volume also 
              will include solicited papers from scientists worldwide,  will be an important
              reference on recent investigations  using new technology on seabird
              conservation, and will have  broad distribution.
