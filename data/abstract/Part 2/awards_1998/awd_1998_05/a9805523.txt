The international conference "Strings '98" will be held at
              the University of California at Santa Barbara, June 22-27, 1998.  String
              theory, which may eventually explain all the basic forces of nature, has made
              dramatic progress in the last few years.  This conference will enable many of
              the leaders of the field, and many new participants, to engage in the exchange
              of ides on which future progress strongly depends.
