	The tectonic circumstances surrounding uplift and denudation
              of high-standing continental interiors such as the high Plains of New Mexico
              and Oklahoma is controversial.  Prominent models envolk cessation of flat-slab
              subduction, tilting of the Plains or long-continued erosion as the cause.  Each
              scenario predicts different timing of the onset of uplift and erosion, and this
              Fission Track project is designed to provide data to discriminate between the
              models.  Results should help constrain how high-plains form in orogenic
              settings.
