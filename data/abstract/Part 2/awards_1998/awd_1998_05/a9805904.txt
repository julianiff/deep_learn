Abstract    :
              9805904 Brion The objective of this research is to increase the understanding of
              the kinetics of iodine inactivation of viruses in drinking water supplies. In
              particular, this project will study the effect of initial virus concentration
              on the reaction kinetics.  Current disinfection theory is based on single-order
              reaction kinetics in which the disinfection rate is independent of the initial
              concentration of the microorganism. This research will test the hypothesis that
              iodine inactivation of virus is dependent upon the initial concentration of the
              virus. The MS-2 bacteriophage will be used as the viral agent. 

The research
              addresses a major gap in our knowledge concerning viral contamination of
              drinking water and its treatment and should lead to improved and more effective
              methods of viral inactivation. The results of the research, and associated
              attendance and presentations at national research conferences and meetings,
              provides opportunity for the PI to enhance her career and support her
              university as it strives to become a nationally recognized research
              institution
