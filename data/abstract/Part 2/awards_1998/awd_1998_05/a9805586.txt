Abstract    :
              This award will support a theoretical and experimental study on the dynamic
              stability of Nash-efficient public goods mechanisms.  The theoretical
              investigation will evolve around developing a new family of supermodular Nash
              mechanisms that implement Lindahl allocations.  The experimental research will
              study the stability of variants from the same new family of mechanisms in a
              laboratory setting with real human subjects.  The data will enable the
              investigator to study the effects of institutions/mechanisms on the resulting
              learning dynamics adopted, to calibrate and compare the performance of
              different learning rules, and to refine and improve on existing learning models
              in light of the data.  Previous theoretical work on Nash implementation has
              mainly focused on establishing the static properties of Nash equilibria.  The
              few exceptions have been using specific dynamic learning rules to study the
              stability of different mechanisms, such as Cournot best response or the
              gradient adjustment process.  Based on previous experimental findings and its
              robust theoretical properties, the investigator proposes to use supermodularity
              as a reasonable stability criterion for Nash-efficient mechanisms.  This
              provides a fresh perspective on implementation theory and contributes to the
              public goods mechanism literature.  The new family of mechanisms will be the
              first Nash-efficient public goods mechanisms which implement Lindahl
              allocations and also have a robust stability property.  The experimental study
              will contribute to the ongoing research on learning and implementation.  The PI
              is an assistant professor who is in an early stage of building up a career that
              combines theoretical and experimental research in mechanism design.  She is in
              her fourth year at Michigan where tenure in the field of economics is difficult
              to achieve.  The POWRE award will assist her at a critical career stage.
