     The investigator and his collaborator, Joseph Blum,
              have
offered the only proposal for how the neurons in the lateral
superior
              olive collectively compute and encode azimuthal location
based on sound level
              difference at the ears.  Recent experimental
evidence indicates that their
              proposal may be correct.  In the
first part of this project, the investigator
              works with
collaborators to compare the model predictions with
              experimental
results.  Analytical investigations explain why the model
              encoding
is very independent of sound level and exceptionally robust
              to
parameter variations and synapse and cell death.  A second part
of the
              project uses mathematical models and machine computation
to investigate neural
              processing in the dorsal nucleus of the
lateral lemniscus, DNLL, an important
              intermediary processing
region between the superior olivary complex and the
              midbrain.
Recent experimental studies have shed new light on the anatomy
and
              physiology of the DNLL, but no modelling studies have been
performed to
              understand how the DNLL neurons process their inputs
and influence the
              encoding of a map of space in the auditory
midbrain.
     Using mathematics
              and computation, the investigator  studies
the structure and function of
              specific groups of nerve cells.  The
main focus of this project is to
              understand how groups of nerve
cells in the brain perform together
              calculations that individual
nerve cells cannot do.  These investigations not
              only help us
understand normal brain function, but should also enable
              the
design of prosthetic devices and treatment strategies in certain
cases of
              brain injury.  In connection with these research
activities, the investigator
              trains mathematics Ph.D. students
and post-doctoral associates in the
              applications of mathematics
to biological systems and medicine.  In addition,
              he teaches a
freshman course entitled "Applications of Mathematics
              to
Physiology and Medicine," which introduces excellent college
freshmen to
              this new and exciting field.
