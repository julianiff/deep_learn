Abstract    :
              Results from SOHO satellite investigations indicate the solar corona streamer
              belt (extending from a band circling the sun into interplanetary space) envelop
              multiple current sheets, and have nearly continuous outflow of multiscale
              transients, ranging from small 'puffs' to large-scale coronal mass ejections. 
              The investigator feels these observations strongly support the interplanetary
              view of the streamer belt, and is providing a morphological basis for future
              space weather prediction at this level.  She analyzes (1) interplanetary data
              from the solar minimum, covering extended periods of streamer belt immersion,
              for magnetic topology using the heat flux polarity test; (2) interplanetary
              data from the stream interface (a heliospheric structure), traditionally
              treated as steady-state, for transient signatures and interaction effects; and
              (3) interplanetary signatures of structures causing major geomagnetic storms
              and coronal mass ejections for magnetic topology in the context of solar and
              heliospheric topology.  Finally, she is statistically studying coronagraph data
              for preferred solar longitudes of coronal mass ejections.  In all, the research
              advances understanding of coronal streamer belt structures,  their interaction
              with high-speed flows, and their impact on Earth.
