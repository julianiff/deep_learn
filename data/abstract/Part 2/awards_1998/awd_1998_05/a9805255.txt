Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to San Diego State  
              University supports the research of Professor David Burkey.  The theme of   the
              research is the use of electrophilic activation in manipulating the  
              reactivity of transition-metal complexes.  A bimetallic complex will be  
              generated by binding a second metal species to a ligand of the original  
              complex.  The incoming metal species will withdraw electron density from   an
              aromatic substituent at the site of attachment in the complex, thereby  
              modifying the nature and reactivity of the original metal complex.  New   types
              of bimetallic complexes with imido, carbyne, acetylene, and   isocyanide groups
              as the bridging ligands in these studies function as   excellent electronic
              bridges, maximizing cooperative interactions between   the two metals.  The
              reactivity of the bimetallic complexes will be   examined with emphasis on
              identifying and exploiting new types of   reactivity unavailable to the
              individual metal complexes.  Formation of bimetallic complexes such as studied
              in this project may be   an effective means of producing catalysts as well as
              in developing new   organometallic materials which exhibit desirable optical
              and magnetic   properties.  Such compounds can serve as models for new types of
                metal-containing polymers with other desirable material properties.
