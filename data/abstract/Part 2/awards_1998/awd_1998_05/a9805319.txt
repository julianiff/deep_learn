Abstract    :
              9805319  Arrowsmith   Convergence between two continental plates is commonly
              accommodated by a complex pathway involving crustal thickening and subduction
              of one block under the other.  These can vary in time and space, producing a
              segmented plate interaction along the suture.  This project will examine the
              Quaternary and recent deformation in the Pamir-Tien Shan convergence zone of
              China, where preliminary data indicates the presence of distinct seismotectonic
              segments and transition zones.  The work will involve geomorphic analysis of
              faults and will be coordinated with a German quaternary glacial chronology
              project.  Results are expected to contribute to understanding of segmentation
              of continent-continent collision zones.
