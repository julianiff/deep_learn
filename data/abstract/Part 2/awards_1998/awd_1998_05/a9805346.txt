Proposed research will address fundamental questions about
              chemical process during metamorphism: (1) What is the scale, geometry, and
              structural control on the channelization of reactive metamorphic fluid flow?
              (2) How much mass is transported into or out of the flow channels by diffusion
              and dispersion? (3) What is the amount and scale of major element mass
              transport by flow? (4) How can episodes of metamorphic fluid flow be dated? The
              questions will be addressed by new field studies of carbonate rocks in 3
              contact metamorphic terrains in California, Italy, and Scotland as well as by
              laboratory study of 3 rock sample suites from New England at hand. Channels for
              fluid flow will be mapped in the field from the distribution of mineral
              reaction products and correlated with structural features.  The geometry amd
              mechanisms of mass transfer will be evaluated by quantitatively interpreting
              reaction progress and O-isotope data with transport theory.  The amount and
              scale of Si-transport will be assessed from chemical analyses of rocks.  The
              age of flow events will be determined by defining the metamorphic conditions at
              which monazite and allanite form and measurement of the minerals' Pb-Th-U ages
              by mass spectrometry.
