During an earthquake, fault surfaces slip at speeds of
              several cm/s to several m/s.  The frictional properties at these slip rates
              play an important role in determining key aspects of seismic rupture, including
              earthquake stress drop, heat production, and the mode of dynamic rupture
              expansion.  However, little is known about friction at dynamic slip velocities.
               The limited available data have been collected under a narrow range of
              conditions and significant discrepancies exist between these data and the
              friction database at lower velocities appropriate to earthquake nucleation. 
              This proposal is to conduct laboratory experiments spanning slip speeds from
              mm/s to m/s.  An important goal will be to quantitatively connect friction
              observations over the entire velocity range and to study the problem of scaling
              laboratory friction data to seismogenic faults.  Bare rock surfaces and
              granular fault gouge will be studied under a range of normal stresses and
              surface conditions, and friction data will be analyzed in terms of existing
              friction theory.  A major goal of the experimental program will be to identify
              the micromechanical causes of velocity-dependent friction and friction
              evolution (state) effects.
