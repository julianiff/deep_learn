Abstract    :
              This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Professor Ellen
              Fisher of Colorado State University.  The research aims to extend the
              capabilities of the PI's laboratory for examining plasma radical species by
              resonant multiphoton ionization detection (REMPI), and to provide postdoctoral
              student support.  The incorporation of a high-frequency Nd:YAG laser into the
              PI's existing equipment would propel her research program into an entirely new
              and exploratory direction in studying fundamental aspects of plasma
              chemistry.

The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance
              Professor Fisher's research potential as well as her educational mentoring of
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists.  The results of this
              research will provide accurate data for those who model plasma systems.  This
              work could also have a large economic impact on the microelectronics industry
              and thin-film technology by providing improvements in plasma processing methods
              which reduce manufacturing costs.
