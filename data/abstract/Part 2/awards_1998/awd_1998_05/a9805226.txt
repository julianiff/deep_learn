This proposal seeks funding for continued investigation and
              development of (U-Th)/He dating of apatite, a new technique which can provide
              quantitative insights to an important but previously inaccessible portion of
              the time-temperature path of many rocks. The ingrowth of He from U and Th
              provides a method for dating minerals with high analytical precision. In
              apatite, studies suggest that He is totally lost by diffusion at temperatures
              >~85oC, but is quantitatively retained at Earth surface temperatures. Apatite
              He ages are thus "cooling ages" that reflect passage through isotherms located
              in the uppermost 1-3 km of the crust. This method is sensitive to temperatures
              substantially lower than are other dating techniques, and may provide
              fundamentally new information on a variety of geologic problems including
              studies of  mountain range exhumation, river incision, and the thermal
              evolution of sedimentary basins. Initial studies confirm systematic and
              meaningful geologic variations of He ages and demonstrate the substantial
              potential of the method. The overall objective of the proposed work is a
              rigorous,  quantitative foundation for reliable, routine application of the
              method and interpretation of the resulting ages.
