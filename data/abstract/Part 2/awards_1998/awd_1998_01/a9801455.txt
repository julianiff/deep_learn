Abstract    :
              9801455  Bazzaz  This research will investigate the function of leaf lifespan in
              relation to other plant traits and to habitat in 15 co-occurring species of the
              oak genus. Leaf lifespans will be used to characterize oaks into functional
              groups that may be used to predict responses to elevated CO2. The research will
              be conducted on mature trees in three field sites in northern Florida and on
              seedlings in greenhouse experiments. The study system provides a large number
              of closely related species which are structurally and physiologically very
              similar, and are all found in the same geographic region, but which have
              contrasting leaf lifespans. This permits study of traits that vary with leaf
              lifespan, without additional trait variation due to different evolutionary
              origins or to climatic differences. The research has three major components: 1)
              quantification of the relationships between leaf lifespan and plant traits
              important for carbon, nutrient and water utilization in oaks, 2) a field survey
              of abundance and percent cover of oak species across soil moisture and nutrient
              gradients to determine whether leaf lifespan is correlated to soil properties,
              and 3) a greenhouse experiment to determine whether leaf lifespan is a useful
              parameter in predicting growth enhancement of oaks under elevated CO2.
