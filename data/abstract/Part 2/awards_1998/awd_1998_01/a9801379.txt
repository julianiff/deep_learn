Abstract    :
                  This award will support the Science Working Group (SSWG) for the SCICEX
              program which is designed to utilize US Navy submarines for scientific research
              in the Arctic. The goals of the SSWG are to ensure that the highest quality
              scientific research is carried out from SCICEX platforms, that these platforms
              are optimally utilized, and that both research planning and synthesis of
              results are coordinated with the national and international Arctic Ocean
              science community.  To attain these goals, the SSWG is organized to 1) provide
              a forum for discussion of research that can utilize SCICEX platforms, 2)
              represent and coordinate SCICEX-based research from other programs, 3) help
              develop appropriate technologies, databases and sampling procedures, 4) provide
              guidance for development and integration of both cruise-specific and overall
              science plans, 5) ensure that SCICEX programs are operationally and
              logistically integrated, and 6) provide guidance toward data integrity,
              archiving, and exchange.
