Abstract    :
              This dissertation is to be a comparative study of unionism in coal mining and
              metals mining in the United States from 1890 to 1917. In coal, the United Mine
              Workers of America (UMWA) grew under conservative, dictatorial officials. In
              metals, by contrast, socialist unionism developed in the form of the Western
              Federation of Miners (WFM). This study will seek to show the forces that shaped
              the divergent political characteristics of these two groups of organized miners
              who otherwise had much in common. Research will be conducted at the UMWA
              Archive at Pennsylvania State University and the western historical collection
              in Norlin Library's archives at University of Colorado, Boulder. Materials at
              these archives will be analyzed in order to uncover the ways in which conflicts
              between and within the ranks of the mine owners and mining unions affected
              union politics in each industry. In focusing on the effects of the strategies
              that workers and mine operators adopted in fighting these conflicts, this
              dissertation will attempt to show that union politics are not shaped by
              objective factors beyond human intervention and will make an important
              contribution to the understanding of how concrete practices matter in
              determining the political allegiances of organized labor.
