Abstract    :
              ***  9801381  Dobson  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will investigate highly reflective substrates that require anti-reflective
              coatings to minimize standing waves and maintain dimensional control.  As
              device dimensions are reduced, this becomes more critical.  Polymer
              anti-reflective coatings are applied by spin coating.  Spin coating tends to
              planarize non-uniform surfaces, resulting in varying thicknesses of material
              over the device topography.  When the coating is etched away, this can result
              in erosion of sidewalls, changing device dimensions.  A new process is required
              for applying polymeric anti-reflective coatings that can produce thin, low
              defectivity, conformal coatings on large-area wafers substrates.  This will
              enable the continued implementation of deep UV processes by U.S. and foreign
              manufacturers.  Plasma CVD can be used to deposit defect-free, conformal
              polymer films with good anti-reflective properties.  The Phase I effort
              successfully demonstrated the use of plasma CVD in depositing a 193 nm
              anti-reflective coating.  In Phase II the proposer will develop chemical
              feedstocks for ultra-thin polymer anti-reflective coatings with high optical
              density at key ultraviolet wavelengths, high conformability, low amount of
              defects, and good resist compatibility.    The proposer will identify robust
              plasma CVD coating deposition processes and lay the groundwork for developing a
              commercial plasma CVD tool in Phase III. ***
