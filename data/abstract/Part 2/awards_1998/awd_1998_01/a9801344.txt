Abstract    :
              9801344  Tuller    The proposed international workshop, to be held in Germany, 
              will bring together research scientists from around the  world to present and
              discuss recent key work in the area of  how the local structure and chemistry
              of interfaces in  functional ceramics can be understood and manipulated to 
              effect useful electrical and chemical phenomena.  The  conference will focus on
              the effect of the nanoscale,  especially on the thermodynamic properties of
              these  ceramics.  The workshop topics to be covered include  preparation,
              characterization, thermodynamics, theory, and  applications of functional
              ceramics.  In addition to the  invited oral contributions, poster presentations
              will deal  with current research.  %%%  This workshop will be co-funded by the
              Ceramics Program in  the Division of Materials Research and the Germany Program
               in the Division of International Programs.  ***
