Abstract    :
              9801703  LaHart     This project involves K-3 classrooms more directly in GLOBE
              activities by designing inquiry-based materials specifically for this age
              group.  Four Storybooks are to be developed, two "big books" for grades K-1 and
              two picture books for grades 2 and 3.   Each is with hands-on learning
              activities that spring from the books.  These books are to link science and
              mathematics with language arts and geography for K-3 students.  These books,
              designed for GLOBE, provide a meaningful introduction to technology, enhance
              young children's learning of science and mathematics concepts and show how
              inquiry can help solve interdisciplinary scientific problems.
