Biologists have been intrigued by cooperative breeding
              systems of birds and mammals because of the apparent altruism of helpers,
              non-breeding adults who seemingly give up their own reproduction in order to
              assist others, much like worker bees and ants.  Explanations of the behavior of
              helpers based on future benefits resulting from their actions, particularly
              inheritance of the breeding position on the territory on which they help, have
              enjoyed considerable success when applied to North American species. In this
              study we test this theory on an Australian bird species. Cooperative breeding
              is far more common in Australia than anywhere else, so any theory of its origin
              must apply there to be at all general.  We also compare the biology of the
              species in fragmented habitat where it is declining to that in intact habitat
              where it continues to thrive in order to discover the basis of its sensitivity
              to habitat fragmentation.  Loss of species to habitat fragmentation is a
              universal problem, whose solution requires a better understanding of the
              biological basis of sensitivity to fragmentation.
