Abstract    :
              The goal of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to
              detect gravitational radiation and to open the entirely new field of
              gravitational-wave astrophysics.  The R&D in support of the construction of
              LIGO will be completed in FY 1998, about 80% of the total construction funds
              have been expended, and the integration of the systems has begun.  By the end
              of 2001, after a period of commissioning and pre-operations, the facility is
              expected to reach its initial design goal of 10^-21 in strain sensitivity.  A
              scientific run lasting about two years is scheduled to begin in early
              2002.

However, the full scope of LIGO science will require that LIGO be
              equipped with gravitational-wave detectors that are more sensitive than those
              installed initially.  Caltech and MIT will conduct a program of research and
              development, leading to significant improvements in the sensitivity of the
              initial LIGO interferometer subsystems.  This activity, together with
              coordinated activities among other participants in the LIGO scientific program,
              is in preparation for the fabrication of new, more sensitive subsytems to be
              installed over a period of about five years beginning as early as 2004.  With
              these upgrades the sensitivity of LIGO will be improved by a factor of 10 to
              100.
