Abstract    :
              Hanken  9801586               This study will examine the development of the
              skull in several  species of amphibians (frogs). Its main goals are to better
              understand the  molecular and genetic processes that underlie the embryonic
              development of bone  in the heads of vertebrate animals, and how these
              processes are modified during  evolution to achieve diversity of skull size and
              shape among species. It also  will provide greater understanding of the
              developmental bases for direct  development, a widespread but poorly studied
              life-history mode found in many  species of living amphibians, and how direct
              development evolved from the  ancestral, metamorphic life history. Individual
              analyses will employ several  different laboratory procedures. These include
              labelling embryonic cells with  vital dyes and embryonic tissue recombinations
              (to identify which cells  contribute to the adult skull); histology and
              immunocytochemistry (to study  detailed aspects of cranial anatomy); and
              recombinant DNA technologies, in situ  hybridization, and implantation of
              protein-soaked beads (to identify genes that  are involved in bone formation
              and determine the likely functions of each). By  supporting this research, this
              award also will enhance the education and  training of a postgraduate student
              and better prepare the PI for a career in  higher education and biological
              research.
