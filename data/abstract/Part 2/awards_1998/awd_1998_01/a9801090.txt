Abstract    :
                  98-01090  Lamberti/Strauss    DDIG: Effects of dissolved organic carbon on
              nitrification rates in aquatic ecosystems    Nitrogen can be present in many
              forms in aquatic ecosystems and the health of these ecosystems is dependent, in
              part, on natural transformations between the different forms.  One
              transformation, termed nitrification, is a bacterial process in which ammonium
              is converted to nitrate.  Nitrification is important because the end product,
              nitrate, can cause nutrient pollution in lakes and streams leading to excessive
              growth of aquatic plants.  High concentrations of nitrate in drinking water
              also have been linked to several human health problems.  Our preliminary
              experiments suggest that the quantity of organic carbon dissolved in water may
              control nitrification rates.  We will conduct several experiments using stream
              and lake sediments, the site of most nitrification, to investigate the
              influence of organic carbon on nitrification rates.  Our basic hypothesis is
              that increasing quantity and quality of organic carbon will reduce
              nitrification because other bacteria will outcompete nitrifying bacteria for
              ammonium.
