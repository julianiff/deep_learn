Abstract    :
              9801001  White    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project is directed at         development of an inexpensive (one step),
              environmentally benign, selective process for epoxidizing propylene and other
              olefins. Interest in this process stems from the high production cost of
              propylene oxide. The Phase II program  will address selective and high rate
              propylene epoxidation using a process where         electrochemically generated
              hydrogen peroxide is directly reacted with propylene  over a selective
              epoxidation catalyst which will be placed in a spatial region very near, but
              separate from the hydrogen peroxide-generating region of the cathode. The Phase
              II research effort will consist of optimizing respectively cathode
              electrocatalyst composition, cathode configuration, and process operating
              conditions. A scaled up prototype electrochemical cell will be designed,
              fabricated and operating during this program. Completion of the program will
              result in an optimized process for selectively and inexpensively converting
              propylene to propylene oxide at high rates. With a targeted selectivity of the
              order of 90-100%, it is anticipated that very efficient separation of product
              electrolyte will be possible. In addition the process will also be capable of
              cogenerating valuable by products and electricity when operated in the fuel
              mode.    Successful completion of the proposed. program will result in a
              one-step process  for the low cost, selective, and high rate synthesis of
              olefin epoxides using in situ electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide.
              The process is potentially  applicable to other oxygenation systems.
