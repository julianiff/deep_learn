Abstract    :
              ***  9801308  Stoel    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11 project
              provides a solution to deal with the negative impact that commercial
              off-the-shelf (COTS) components have on testability.  The ever shrinking
              time-to-market, in the electronics industry, has created an increasing need for
              COTS components to slash development time.  At the chip level, where
              Intellectual Property (IP) cores are being used, the main problem is
              controllability of the primary inputs and observability of the primary outputs
              of the embedded cores.  ASC has developed a solution based on the boundary scan
              standard being applied to all cores.  To avoid high circuitry overhead and long
              test times, ASC developed an optimization methodology during Phase I, which
              provides: Direct access to each embedded core, short test times, low hardware
              overhead, and flexibility in test configuration.  During Phase II, ASC will
              enhance its existing VBIT(R) tool to allow designers to automatically insert
              optimized boundary scan in their chip designs with embedded cores.  This new
              VBIT-MC (Multi-Core) tool will be integrated into existing EDA design flows, be
              capable of using existing test data, and have a graphical front-end.    With a
              rapidly growing market for test tools and without competitors on the horizon,
              the commercial prospects for VBIT-MC are excellent.  ***
