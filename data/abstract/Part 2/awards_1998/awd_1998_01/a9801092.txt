Abstract    :
              9801092  Allan    Heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in the cycling
              of carbon and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.  In tropical freshwaters,
              however, it is unclear how bacterial activity is regulated.  Because
              temperatures are consistently high in tropical systems, the influence of carbon
              and nutrient availability, rather than temperature, is expected to be
              particularly strong.  In addition, in tropical rivers, large seasonal
              variations in rainfall strongly influence the amount of carbon and nutrient
              inputs from land, which should in turn influence bacterial activity. The PI's
              have preliminary data for one year showing that bacterial production is very
              low in lowland rivers of the Orinoco basin, and these data suggest seasonal
              variation related to hydrology. In this dissertation research the PI's will
              investigate the following questions: (1) What is controlling bacterial
              production in lowland rivers of the Orinoco basin? and (2) Are there patterns
              in bacterial production associated with hydrologic seasonality? To answer these
              questions the PIs will conduct substrate addition and pH amendment experiments
              to determine the factors limiting bacterial growth, and measure bacterial
              production at different points in the annual flow cycles in two black and two
              clearwater rivers of the Middle Orinoco basin. The proposed research will
              determine how bacteria are regulated in tropical lowland rivers and will
              increase knowledge about the function of relatively undisturbed rivers in the
              neotropics before they are affected by development.
