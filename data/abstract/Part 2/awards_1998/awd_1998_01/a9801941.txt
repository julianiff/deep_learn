Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed program is to use midlatitude magnetogram data to
              examine the spatial and temporal development of magnetic Substorms and Storms. 
              The study will separate out effects that are determined by Local Time (LT) from
              those that are determined by universal Time (UT).  The study will produce UT-LT
              maps of the development and decay of storms and substorms and compare these
              results with a variety of models.  In addition to the magnetogram data, the
              study will utilize global auroral images obtained from the POLAR satellite's
              UVI instrument.  The proposed work will allow one to determine the differences
              between the effects of single substorms and multiple substorms and allow one to
              discriminate periods of multiple substorms from storms.  The study is fully
              consistent with the goals of the GEM Tail and Substorms Campaign.
