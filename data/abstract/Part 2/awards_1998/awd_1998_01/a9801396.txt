Abstract    :
                        Komlos  9801396    This award supports joint research of Komlos and
              Szemeredi in the theory of random structures. The theory of random structures
              is well developed. The interesting interface of randomness with discrete
              mathematics, however, is the use of random or quasi-random methods to
              deterministic problems.  The PI's have developed a number of statistical
              methods, including the Regularity Lemma, the Blow-up Lemma, and certain
              relaxations of Turan's theorem. They are all based on some kind of
              approximation of deterministic structures with random-looking ones. The present
              project goes beyond these tools and extends the methods to sparse graphs and
              hypergraphs. These methods are strong enough to help attack several hard
              classical problems in graph and hypergraph theory.     This research is in the
              area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient
              methods for manipulating and enumerating discrete collections of objects. The
              behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications.
              For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
              systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete
              sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.
