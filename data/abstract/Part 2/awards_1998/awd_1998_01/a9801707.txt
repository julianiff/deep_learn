This proposal addresses the use of metal nanoshells and
              metal-dielectric nanoparticles assemblies for the "nanoengineering" of a wide
              variety of unique and potentially technologically important optical properties
              into both materials and devices.  The central goal is to apply these
              enhancement of existing materials and the development of new materials and
              devices.  This is a multidisciplinary effort composed of nanopartical
              synthesis, film and device preparation, a variety of optical and physical
              spectroscopies and measurements, the theoretical analysis.  The specific topics
              of focus are:

- the development of metal nanoshell-based materials as
              infrared absorbers and NLO materials,   and as solar absorbing/scattering
              materials;

- the incorporation of metal nanoshells into conducting polymers
              where the metal nanoshell resonances are judiciously placed in interact
              selectively with specific excitations of the material;

- the addition of
              photoluminescent species into the dielectric core of metal nanoshells, to
              characterize the effect of the metallic "nanocavity" on the optically active
              species inside;

- the fabrication of layered device structures incorporating
              metal nanoshells, to characterize plasmon-induced hot electron-based
              photoconductivity in these devices;

- to exploit the intense local field of
              the metal nanoshell plasmon by incorporating the nanostructure at the apex of a
              Scanning Tunneling Microscop tip, for optically addressable probe tip
              applications;

- to develop nanoparticle assemblies as terahertz-resonant
              materials and as an experimental testbed for studying and controlling
              plasmon-plasmon interactions in well-characterized geometries.

Although
              highly multidisciplinary in scope, the work described in this proposal is
              consistent with the demonstrated expertise of the Principal Investigator, her
              research group, and her current collaborators.  This integrated combination of
              chemical synthesis, optical and electron spectroscopies, scanning probe
              microscopies, and theory defines and exciting research atmosphere in which
              graduate students propsper and provides a successful, innovative paradigm for
              applied research.
