Parasites cause tremendous damage to plant and animal
              populations.  Many organisms have evolved partial resistance (immunity) to
              parasites. However, little is known of the physiological costs and evolutionary
              dynamics of maintaining such immunity. This project will explore the costs that
              the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) experiences in maintaining partial
              immunity against the parasitic wasp (Asobara tabida).  The research will
              measure fitness costs of flies that survive the parasite versus those that were
              unparasitized.

This is an ideal system for studying immunity because of the
              wealth of prior information on the genetics and development of fruit flies. 
              Moreover, wasp parasites are often used in biocontrol programs for noxious
              insects; and understanding the nature of those defenses against wasp parasites
              may enable agricultural scientists to "engineer" parasites that better evade
              host immune systems.
