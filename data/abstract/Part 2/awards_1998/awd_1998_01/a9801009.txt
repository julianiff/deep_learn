The main goal of this project is to apply methods of modern
              mathematics to problems arising in theoretical physics.  Many of problems are
              related to M-theory.  This theory can be considered as an extension of string
              theory.  It is believed that M-theory describes all interactions existing in
              nature.  It was conjectured recently that M-theory can be formulated as a
              matrix model, called M(atrix) theory.  It is clear in this approach that the
              geometry of physical space is non-commutative in some sense, and so it is
              natural to apply methods of non-commutative geometry.  This idea was used in
              the formulation of some projects as well as in our recent work concerning
              toroidal compactifications of M(atrix) theory.  Most of the other problems are
              related to applications of super-geometry to various problems of quantum field
              theory, including general problems of quantization of gauge theories and
              topological quantum field theory.
