Abstract    :
              ***  Xiao             This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a high performance microfocus x-ray fluorescence (MXRF)
              instrument for geochemical applications.  X-ray fluorescence is an useful
              analytical tool that can perform nondestructive elemental analysis on
              essentially any sample with high sensitivity.  A serious limitation to current
              commercial MXRF systems is a lack of X-ray intensity on the samples because
              only a small fraction of the X-rays from conventional sources can be captured
              using pinhole collimators or monocapillaries.  Phase I results show that this
              MXRF instrument, designed around an innovative polycapillary focusing lens, can
              improve measurement sensitivity (10x), speed (100x), and spatial resolution
              (from 100 to 20 microns) of current commercial MXRF instruments.  Phase II will
              develop a laboratory prototype instrument and a simplified system for field
              use, and performance will be tested using various geological samples. 
              Performance will be compared to currently available MXRF systems and to
              electron microprobes to understand the advantages of the new instrument for
              geologists and other end-users in industry and science.    A successful MXRF
              would significantly benefit geochemistry and various industries, including
              semiconductor manufacture, environmental remediation, and industrial plating. 
              It will also find application in scientific instrument manufacture.
