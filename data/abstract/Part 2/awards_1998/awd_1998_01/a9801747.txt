Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take  place
              within it.  This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE
              Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols,
              and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the 
              current set of GLOBE soil measurement protocols, with the  quality control
              segment being provided by cooperation with  the USDA Natural Resources
              Conservation Service.  The  project will use GLOBE student-collected data to
              derive  algorithms for physical and chemical soil system simulation  models,
              including the Frozen Soil Temperature model (FroST).  The GLOBE soil data will
              be used to determine baseline  estimates of soil quality within various
              ecosystems and land  use scenarios.  Seasonal measurements of surface soil 
              characteristics will assess regional changes in soil  quality.  This proposal
              will also support the development of  materials for education that will include
              soil science in  the context of Earth Systems Science.  Scientists, students, 
              and the general public will be able to better understand the  role of living
              soil in ecosystems and their role in the care  of our natural resources.  %%%
