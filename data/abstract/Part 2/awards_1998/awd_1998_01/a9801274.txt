Abstract    :
              9801274  Thomson  This research will assess the effect of the European honey
              bee, Apis mellifera, on the native solitary bee, Osmia pumila. Previous studies
              investigating the effects of invasive social insects concentrated on native
              social species. This study focuses on native solitary species, which may be
              more vulnerable to competition with social species. The importance of
              competitive effects relative to other factors influencing O. pumila fitness
              will be determined with field and enclosure studies. Field experiments will
              provide measures of reproductive success of O. pumila at different densities of
              honey bees. The mechanism of interaction will be investigated by examining
              possible shifts in resource use of O. pumila associated with increased honey
              bee density. Enclosure experiments will test for indirect effects of
              competition on O. pumila fitness mediated through increased parasitism rates.
              Data from both approaches will allow some predictions of O. pumila population
              dynamics under different competitive regimes. These experiments will yield
              timely information on a ubiquitous and prolific introduced species whose
              beneficial and detrimental impacts are being debated currently in ecological
              and agricultural arenas. This system's unique features allow a robust
              experimental design, but the results are broadly applicable to work on
              biological invasions, particularly those involving social insects.
