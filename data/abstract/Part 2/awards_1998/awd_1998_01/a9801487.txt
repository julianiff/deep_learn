Abstract    :
                  9801487  Chapin/Eviner    DDIG: The role of plant species and plant species
              interactions in mediating nitrogen and carbon dynamics    The objective of this
              study is to determine how plant species that are growing together influence
              ecosystem dynamics. Vegetation composition is being drastically altered due to
              changes in land use, pollutants, climate, and invasion of exotic species.
              Plants not only respond to these changes, but they also play an active role in
              mediating their surrounding environment, and can affect nutrient and water
              availability, sustainability, production, etc.. However, we have no way of
              predicting which vegetation shifts will impact an ecosystem. Many recent
              studies have indicated that individual plant species can have different effects
              on ecosystem dynamics. However, most plant species exist in a mixed species
              community, and the effect of the overall community can't be predicted from the
              effects of the component species alone. Understanding the ways that plant
              species interact will help us understand the importance of a species addition
              or deletion on the ecosystem.
