Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9801293  Peter T. Cummings/U. of Tenn    This proposal seeks funds
              to support a National Science foundation workshop, entitled:  "Workshop on
              Future directions in Molecular Modeling and Simulation:  Fundamentals and
              Applications," to be held at the National Science foundation, November 3-4,
              1997.  A broad spectrum of approximately 20 experts from academia, industry and
              government laboratories have been invited, and agreed, to make presentations in
              the workshop.  An additional 20 researchers will participate in the workshop's
              discussions and breakout sessions.  The workshop will deliver a report to the
              National Science Foundation by December 1, 1997.    The goals of the workshop
              are:  1. To survey the current state of  the art in academic research and
              industrial practice in the areas of computational chemistry and molecular
              simulation;  2. To identify major impediments to further progress in the field
              and the adoption of these methods by industry; and  3. To determine highly
              promising new directions for methodological developments and application areas.
                     The report of this workshop will provide a working document for National
              Science foundation staff to provide guidance to the academic research community
              as to important opportunities and needs for research in Molecular Modeling and
              Simulation.
