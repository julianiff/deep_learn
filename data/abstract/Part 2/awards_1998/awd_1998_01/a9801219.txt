Professor Gillet will work on problems involving
              the interaction between K-theory and arithmetic geometry.  He will study
              algebraic analogs to Arakelov theory for varieties over discretely valued
              fields.  He hopes to establish an arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem.  It is hoped
              that these researches will lead to improved insights into the structure of sets
              of rational points on arithmetic varieties.  In addition to these algebraic
              problems, Professor Gillet will study intersections of analytic cycles from a
              purely analytic perspective.

Analysis, geometry and algebra are three of the
              major attacks used to investigate modern mathematical problems.  All three have
              been used repeatedly on the ancient problem of solving equations using
              fractions alone.  Geometrically this problem amounts to finding rational points
              (points described by fractions) on curves (equations viewed as graphs.)  Giving
              such solutions a geometric interpretation makes them more concrete.  But having
              done this, the modern approach to geometry constructs abstract algebraic
              objects that behave like familiar geometric objects.  At the same time analytic
              techniques that use Calculus can help understand the same geometric objects in
              a different way.  In this project Professor Gillet will study certain
              collections of rational solutions of equations, varieties, using geometry,
              algebra, and analysis in tandem.  The combination of several modern ideas will
              lead to new insights into the structure of the rational solutions of rational
              equations.
