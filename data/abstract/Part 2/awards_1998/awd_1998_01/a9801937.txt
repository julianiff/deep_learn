Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to implement Phase I of the Global Geospace
              Circulation Model (GGCM).  The development of a GGCM is the primary goal of the
              GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) program.  Phase I of the GGCM development
              is designed to provide the user community with detailed simulations results for
              a selected set of idealized IMF and solar wind dynamic pressure conditions. 
              The conditions to be simulated were chosen by the GGCM steering committee.  The
              UCLA MHD code will be used to generate models for the specified conditions as
              well as for individual events selected for special study by the GEM program. 
              The UCLA MHD code has already been developed and tested and has been shown to
              produce realistic results for some specific event studies.  This program will
              simulated all of the IMF and solar wind dynamic pressure conditions selected by
              the committee and in addition will perform the simulation for three different
              dipole tilts (no tilt, equinox and solstice).  This program will also provide
              the space science community with Web access to the results as well as other
              visualization tools to be used with the digital data outputs of the
              simulations.  The proposed effort will be done at very modest cost, since the
              MHD code to be used has already been developed and tested.
