Abstract    :
              Theoretical investigations of the generation, characterization and manipulation
              of matter waves are undertaken.  In contrast to the photon field, the field of
              matter waves requires the introduction of new forms of detection and
              correlation functions to characterize the physics.  The program proposed by the
              PI will search for these generalizations and them apply them to a number of
              situation of experimental interest.
