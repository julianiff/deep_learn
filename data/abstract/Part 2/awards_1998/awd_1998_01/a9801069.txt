Abstract    :
              9801069  Garst    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
              develop a prototype handwriting based input system for mathematical notation
              which demonstrates the ease of use, recognition accuracy and editing power
              required to make computer input of mathematical equations easier than writing
              them on a pad of paper.  This will solve the persistent problem of tedious and
              difficult input methods for text formatters, technical assistants and other
              systems which require input of mathematical notation.  The proposed work
              includes collection of handwritten mathematical data, investigation of a usable
              interface and editing system, and research into a fast and accurate recognizer
              for handwritten notation.    The market for natural and efficient input of
              mathematical notation is potentially very large, spread across a range of
              innovative products for students and professionals in many technical, business
              and educational fields.  Potential applications include easy electronic
              communication of mathematical notation; far more productive word processors for
              technical notation; handheld calculators which accept symbolic problems as
              easily as numeric ones; and others.  CIC is in a strong position to pursue
              commercialization.  Its licensees include IBM, NEC, Nortel and many others.
