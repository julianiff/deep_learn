Abstract    :
                9801327  Sachatello-Sawyer      The Museum of the Rockies will plan an exhibit
              "The Rockies Rise Again."  When completed, this exhibit will illustrate
              evolving Cenozoic landscapes and life forms as understood through research
              conducted by the museum's staff in the Northern Rocky Mountain region.  This
              exhibit will provide the natural historical context for visitors as they
              explore the cultural history exhibits that will follow this section.  Together,
              the Museum's exhibits will illustrate the theme "One Place Through All of
              Time."    With this award they will engage in a series of planning activities
              will include a front-end evaluation study of the public's knowledge and
              interest in this subject, consultation with expert advisors, review of related
              Cenozoic exhibits in selected natural history museums, and a two-day symposium
              which will include a dialogue about the exhibit concepts between the scientists
              and the public to help complete the plan.  They will also hire an educator to
              develop an educational plan that will link the exhibit with the needs of
              teachers and will address national and state science standards.  Special
              attention will be given to developing materials and dissemination strategies
              that will serve educators in this largely rural setting.  At the end of the
              twelve month planing period they will have a completed exhibit and education
              plan and will be able to move forward with the exhibit.
