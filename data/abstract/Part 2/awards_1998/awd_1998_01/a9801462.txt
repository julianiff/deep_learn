Abstract    :
                9801462  Ringnalda     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
               project will develop user-friendly and highly effective software for chemists,
              biochemists, and materials scientists that will allow routine application of
              quantum chemical methods to complex metal-containing systems, including
              organometallic molecules, transition metal clusters, and compounds containing
              rare earth metals. This novel software will incorporate chemical rules and
              intuition about metal-containing systems into the initial guess wavefunction. 
              As the Phase I results for  this project demonstrate, the improved guess will 
              lead to far more reliable convergence.    These new features will make it easy,
              practical, and chemically intuitive for expert and non-expert users of
              electronic structure software to run complicated calculations on
              metal-containing systems, including computation of excited states.  Each new
              feature will be intelligently automated, and any information generated will be
              shown to the user  in "chemist-friendly" formats such as orbital energy
              diagrams.  The program will  also be responsive to changes requested by the
              researcher. The combination of automation, user control, and quantum chemical
              accuracy promised by the software will be a major advance over existing 
              programs.    A quantum chemical program with the advanced  capabilities for
              transition metal systems described in this proposal would allow rapid progress
              on many problems of industrial interest, particularly studies of' homogeneous
              and heterogeneous catalysis.
