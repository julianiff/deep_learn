Abstract    :
              Proposal No. IBN-9801452  Dissertation Research:  "Paternity Assessments in a 
              Population of Humpback Whales (Megaptera Novaeangliae)"        Although whale
              mating behavior is difficult to observe,  their mating systems can be assessed
              by genetic techniques.  This study will determine the mating system from the 
              parentage in a natural breeding population of humpback  whales.  Skin samples
              will be obtained by approaching whales  in a small boat and harpooning biopsy
              samples from adult  males (individually recognized by their flukes), and from 
              adult females and their calves; this does not harm the  whales.  Molecular
              genetics lab work then will match the  DNA of each calf with the DNA of its
              mother and its possible  father. By comparing the variation in reproductive
              success  from the genetic fingerprints among the large representative  local
              sample of males, the mating system of the population  can be assessed.   The
              results may explain the elaboration  of the complex male songs and behavior
              traditions in  humpback whales, and they will further the understanding of 
              sexual selection in mammalian mating systems.  The study is  the first
              assessment of male reproductive success in a  mysticete whale.    This method
              may prove to be especially important in studies  to determine the mating
              systems of whales and other marine  mammals where mating is difficult to
              observe. scientific  model may apply in determining the mating systems in
              marine  The results may be of general significance to conservation  of whale
              populations.
