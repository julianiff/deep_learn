Abstract    :
              Stafford,  9801148

Initially, one considers a reductive, complex Lie algebra
              g with adjoint group G, Cartan subalgebra h and Weyl group W.  In this case,
              Professors Levasseur and Stafford  have shown  that the Harish-Chandra
              homomorphism  from G-invariant differential operators on g to W-invariant
              differential operators on h  is surjective with kernel  generated by tau(g),
              where tau denotes the differential of of the adjoint action of G on g.  This
              has numerous applications to the theory of invariant eigendistributions, to the
              representation theory of g and to generalizations of the Springer
              correspondence.  Generalizations of these results and their applications to the
              G-invariant differential operators for more general G-representations V will be
              studied.  In particular, Professor Stafford intends to study the invariant
              differential operators on G and on symmetric spaces.  These results are also
              related to longstanding questions about the commuting variety of g (for
              example, whether it is normal), which Professor Stafford will investigate
              further.

Professor Stafford works in the general area of algebra,
              specifically in the study of algebras for which multiplication is not
              commutative.  Such algebras arise in many areas of mathematics and science; for
              example, in the theory of quantum groups (which, ultimately, come from quantum
              physics), and in the theory of differential equations.  The techniques of
              ``noncommutative Noetherian algebra'' can be applied to study questions in
              these diverse areas.
