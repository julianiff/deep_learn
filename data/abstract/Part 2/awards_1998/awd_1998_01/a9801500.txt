Abstract    :
              IVANOV, 98-01500      The proposer will work on further development and
              applications of  a geometric machinery of graded diagrams which was recently
              created to  solve the famous Burnside problem on periodic groups for all 
              sufficiently large exponents and has already been successfully applied to 
              prove Gromov's conjecture on periodic quotients of hyperbolic groups  of
              bounded exponent. In particular, the proposer will carry out this  machinery to
              free products of groups, investigate finitely presented  groups given by
              periodic relations and subgroups of free Burnside  groups of large even
              exponent, and apply this machinery to  nonhyperbolic groups with classical
              small cancellation conditions.    The field of group theory is the mathematical
              theory of symmetry and interacts with many other disciplines, for example
              physics and chemistry outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and
              geometry inside mathematics. This research  is in combinatorial group theory
              which studies groups defined by means of generators and defining relations and
              is the intersection of group theory, low dimensional topology,  geometry, and
              the theory of computability.
