This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research
              in the area of optoelectronic processing systems between Carl W. Wilmsen of
              Colorado State University and W. A. Crossland of Cambridge University.  The
              objectives of their research are to develop smart pixel arrays that incorporate
              vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and ferroelectric liquid
              crystals (FLC) and to investigate the advantages of integrating the high speed
              of VCSELs and the high density of FLC arrays.  The project will concentrate on
              communication cross point switches and consider other applications such as high
              order correlation and 3D TV.

The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration extensive expertise in VCSELs and the insertion of these arrays
              into optoelectronic parallel processing systems.  This is complemented by
              British expertise FLC smart pixel arrays and processing systems.
