              Vasconcelos,  98-01413      Abstract    Vasconcelos    This award supports
              research in commutative  algebra, algebraic geometry  and computational
              algebra. It is centered on the   development of a new  series of numerical
              signatures of rings and algebras, the so-called   homological degrees, that 
              play in local rings and arbitrary algebras   a role similar to
              Castelnuovo--Mumford's regularity in graded structures.   It will also
              emphasize   the algebraization (particularly Cohen-Macaulayness   and
              normality) of blowup algebras---Rees   algebras of ideals and modules and
              tangent and secant algebras---and the  examination of algebras associated to 
              commuting sets of elements of  Lie  algebras, the computation of rings of
              invariants of connected groups   and algebras of combinatorial interest.    
              Commutative algebra is broadly concerned with solutions of  structured sets of 
               polynomial and analytic equations, and the study of pathways to methods and  
              algorithms that facilitate the  efficient processing in  large  scale 
              computations  with such data. These equations often arise internally  in the
              construction of new geometric structures or in domains of applications,  such
              as control and coding theory and robotic motion. A mathematically focused 
              approach is required  in order to beat the complexity in problems of  interest.
