Abstract    :
              ***  9801382    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
              will enable custom RNA Synthesis to be affordable, timely, and more powerful
              through the incorporation of desired modifications.  Phase I results
              demonstrated that novel 5'-silyl-2'-orthoester RNA synthesis chemistry yields
              authentic RNA oligonucleotides in high yield and of unprecedented quality. 
              However, the utility of this chemistry would be limited if it was restricted to
              the synthesis of all-ribo oligonucleotides.  Market research and ongoing
              consultations have highlighted the additional need to include modifications.
              Current commercial RNA synthesis chemistries allow incorporation of
              modifications, but only chemists and other knowledgeable specialists appear to
              have significant success with these alternatives.  RNA synthesis is not readily
              accessible to biologists.  The achievement of the Phase II objectives will
              result in 5'-silyl-2'-orthoester chemistry providing the technological  leap
              necessary to make custom RNA synthesis readily available to all biologists.
              This will require both incorporating desired modifications and decreasing
              synthesis costs and turnaround times.  The result will be the ready
              accessibility of custom RNA synthesis to the entire scientific community for a
              wide range of applications.    Project success will satisfy the needs of the
              research community for affordable, reliable, custom synthesis of RNA toward
              numerous applications.      ***
