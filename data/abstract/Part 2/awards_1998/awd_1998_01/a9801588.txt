Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within
              it.  This proposal will carry out the  development of new surface ozone
              observation protocols using  a chemically sensitive paper that changes color in
              response  to ozone exposure.  Ozone levels will be estimated by  comparing the
              paper color to a reference color chart.  This  will complement and be supported
              by on-going work at NASA to  separate stratospheric ozone from tropospheric and
              lower  atmosphere ozone signals, all of which are detected by space-  borne
              sensors, but are indistinguishable without ground data  such as those provided
              by this method.  The project has the  endorsement of the International Global
              Atmospheric  Chemistry Program Steering Committee (IGAC).  Tropospheric  and
              surface ozone are important for different reasons, and  introducing students
              and teachers to the difference in  effects of ozone at these different
              altitudes and to the  different sources of ozone is valuable to the learning 
              process.  Accurate observations of surface ozone on the  spatial and temporal
              scales afforded by the GLOBE program  will provide a significant advance for
              science and its study  of ozone's effects on health and biological systems in 
              general.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
