Abstract    :
              9801607  Foote    The origin of the seed in the Late Devonian was a key
              innovation that facilitated the exploitation of a wide range of terrestrial
              environments and diverse ecological strategies during the early evolution of
              plants on land.  Throughout the late Paleozoic, seed plants radiated in
              environments with ecological dynamics and organization that were fundamentally
              different from those of the Recent, most notably in the absence of tetrapod
              herbivory, limited direct plant-insect interactions, and strong phylogenetic
              partitioning of ecological strategies among different plant groups.  The fossil
              seed record of the late Paleozoic provides an opportunity to study how
              increasing complexity and modernization of ecological interactions was
              reflected in structural adaptations to protect and disperse propagules.  The
              research proposed here includes analyses of taxonomic diversity and
              morphological disparity in subclades of late Devonian to Permian fossil seed
              plants.  The evolutionary significance of seed size will be examined by testing
              for trends in volume.  A morphospace based on seed morphology will be used to
              test hypothesized patterns of morphological and ecological overlap among seed
              plant subclades.  This research will be the first quantitative treatment of
              macroevolutionary patterns during the early history of a major group of land
              plants and will contribute to understanding of the unique structure of late
              Paleozoic terrestrial ecosystems.
