Abstract    :
              9801495     Columbus    The importance of chromosomal change in speciation and
              its role in producing reproductive barriers has long been recognized as a
              factor that can lead to morphological diversification.  An ideal system with
              which to study processes of chromosome change is Carex L. (Cyperaceae) one of
              the largest genera in the world with approximately 2,000 species recognized,
              which has an extremely wide range of chromosome numbers from n=6 to 68.  Three
              questions will be investigated in this study:  1)  What role does change in
              chromosome number play in speciation in Carex.  2) What mechanisms are involved
              in cytogenetic change among species within Carex section Acrocystis.  3) What
              are the relationships among lineages within section Acrocystis and between
              Acrocystis and other sections of Carex?  Molecular phylogenetic analyses of two
              nuclear and one chloroplast DNA region will be used to create a framework for
              studying the patterns of chromosomal change measured using chromosome counts,
              flow cytometric measurements of genome size, fertility among species with
              different chromosome numbers, and position of repetitive DNA elements such as
              telomeres on the chromosomes.  These four different data sets, together with
              phylogenetic hypotheses, will be used to indicate both the kinds of chromosomal
              change and the direction that change has occurred.
