Abstract    :
              The proposed research program will study the substorm injection process by
              examining particle drifts in realistic magnetic fields.  The study will develop
              a self-consistent picture of the evolution of the fields, currents, and
              pressures in the magnetosphere during a substorm.  The Magnetosphere
              Specification Model will be modified to allow the boundary conditions to be
              varied in time so that conditions appropriate to the various states in a
              substorm can be simulated and compared with observations.  The effects of
              current systems on the magnetic field structure will be incorporated
              self-consistently.  Other refinements will also be added, including diffusion
              and losses due to wave-particle interactions, and the effect of particle
              precipitation on ionospheric conductivities.
