Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito that also vectors
              dengue hemorrhagic fever, has reemerged in southeastern Arizona after fifty
              years of putative eradication.  The proposed study will use molecular markers
              to examine the genetic structure of this population of mosquitoes, and that of
              neighboring populations, in order to determine the genetic and/or historical
              factors that define this invasion. It is not clear if A. aegypti has recently
              recolonized the Tucson area, or if it has been present all along at very low
              frequencies with recent conditions being ripe for a population expansion.  If
              the former is the case, the resulting genetic data will have value to the field
              of invasion biology. In the latter case, empirical results regarding the
              recovery of a population from a small number of individuals will be useful to
              conservation biologists.  Also, information about the origin and migration
              patterns of an insect disease vector should greatly benefit future eradication
              programs.
