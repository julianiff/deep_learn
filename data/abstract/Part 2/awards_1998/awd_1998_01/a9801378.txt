One of the fundamental challenges facing biologists is to
              define the processes by which biodiversity is created.  Adaptive radiations,
              which occur through a rapid series of speciation events that produce organisms
              differing in ecologically important traits, are a primary source of
              biodiversity.  Exploration of speciation mechanisms can therefore provide great
              insight into the processes by which biodiversity is created. To examine
              speciation we will be using the remarkable adaptive radiation of the threespine
              stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus.  In recently de-glaciated areas, such as
              our research site in Alaska, freshwater stickleback populations have diverged
              from a common marine ancestor in a remarkably short period of time.  The
              freshwater populations have evolved many different types of organismal traits,
              and often show a correlated divergence in those traits.  We will investigate
              how change in one trait can set the stage for changes in other traits, a
              process known as a 'trait' or 'character cascade'.  Specifically, we will
              examine whether an initial divergence in stickleback ecology can cause a
              cascade of character changes that eventually leads to a divergence in mating
              preferences, an initial step in speciation.  Because of the correlated
              evolution of many characters in recently formed populations, threespine
              stickleback provide a model system for studying how cascades of character
              change can lead to the formation of new species.
