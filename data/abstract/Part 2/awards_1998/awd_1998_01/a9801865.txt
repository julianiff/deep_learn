This three-year award supports U.S.-Portugal cooperative
              research between the PATH project of the University of California at Berkeley,
              led by Parvin Varaiya, and the Systems and Robotics Group of the Engineering
              Faculty (SRG) of the University of Porto; the faculty group is led by Fernando
              Lobo Pereira.  The objective of the PATH project is to design automated highway
              systems so that capacity and safety of surface transportation are increased
              substantially.  This project is part of the Federal Highway Authority's
              Intelligent Transportation Systems Program.  SRG has been engaged in a project
              of oceanographic field study involving the coordinated operation of multiple
              autonomous underwater vehicles, based on the concept of a Generalized Vehicle
              (GV). 
The objective of the proposed collaboration is to apply the theory of
              interactive hybrid systems to the coordinated movement of multiple vehicles,
              and the design and implementation of real-time control algorithms for such
              movement.

The U.S. group brings to this collaboration their expertise in
              theory for hybrid control and verification and a test environment, the
              automated highway systems project.  This is complemented by the application of
              the GV concept to multiple autonomous underwater vehicles developed by the
              Portuguese group at The University of Porto.  The project is expected to take
              advantage of the application scenarios as well as of the complementary
              experiences to identify more efficient ways of solving the problem of robust
              low-cost navigation for land and underwater vehicles.
