Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within
              it.  This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program
              needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and
              scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the  current
              set of GLOBE land cover/biology protocols.  This project will modify existing
              protocols, develop and  test new ones, and review GLOBE data submitted to the 
              archive.  The project will support the overall training and  outreach
              activities of the program, fostering student  scientist partnerships.  The
              scientific issue addressed by  this proposal is the need to integrate reference
              data  collection and accuracy assessment (i.e. validation) into  land cover
              data sets generated from remotely sensed data.  Other GLOBE protocols provide
              data that are currently  collected by other sources around the world (e.g. 
              temperature, precipitation), however, no other source of  regional,
              continental, much less global validation data is  currently being collected
              anywhere except by GLOBE students.  This land cover/biology investigation has
              the double benefit  of allowing student to experience the process of science 
              while providing for a unique and valuable validation data  set for use by the
              remote sensing community.  This project  is collaborating with NASA's Moderate
              Resolution Imaging  Spectroradiometer (MODIS) team to provide the calibration 
              and validation data for this new NASA Earth Observing System  sensor in order
              to generate regional land cover maps  worldwide.  Students will work primarily
              with Landsat data,  as well as learning how to use geographic information 
              systems (GIS) to answer scientific questions about land  cover mapping.  %%%
