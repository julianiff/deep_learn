The topics studied include the damping of excitations
              in Bose-Einstein condensates, the coherence properties of Bose condensates and
              atom lasers, possible superfluidity of a Bose condensate forced into a toroidal
              configuration and the interaction of a Bose condensate with light and with a
              degenerate Fermi gas.  The goal is to formulate new concepts that shape the
              physics of Bose-Einstein condensation in trapped alkali gases.
