Abstract    :
                 ***     9801531     Lieberman        This Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR) Phase II project will use a new approach to correlation spectroscopy to
              develop a rugged, cost-effective, highly sensitive, chemical detection system. 
              Using a novel tunable filter demonstrated during Phase I to replace the
              unwieldy "reference cell" found in current systems,  a compact sensor package
              will be fabricated that allows this powerful technique to be used in a wide
              variety of field applications.    The heart of the system is an optical
              structure whose transmission spectrum has been radically altered to match the
              target compound by incorporating a series of light-scattering elements; the
              filter is modulated to tune its spectrum into and out of coincidence with that
              of the target, providing highly compound-specific detection. The Phase II
              project will: (1) Mathematically model the new sensor, (2) Optimize the filter
              and modulation system, (3) Optimize the semiconductor light source used in the
              system, (4) Increase spectral modulation frequencies, (5) Integrate all
              components into a complete correlation spectroscopy system and demonstrate
              response suitable for commercial methane sensing, and (6) Initiate plans and
              strategic relations that will lead to Phase III commercialization of sensors
              based on this new technology.    The Phase II  system will lead directly to a
              practical methane sensor that can be used in mine monitoring, and potentially
              even in home safety applications.  By simply replacing the tunable tailored
              filter element, the same basic optoelectronic unit can be used to sense other
              hydrocarbon gases, different greenhouse gases, or other compounds.  Spin-off
              applications for tunable tailored filters also abound in other branches of
              photonics.     ***
