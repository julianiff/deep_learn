Abstract    :
              Research involving the preparation, structural characterization, and  
              reactivities of carboxonium, sulfonium and hydrido onium ions such as   BH6+
              and AlH6+  in superacid solutions will be continued.  Structures and  
              reactivities will be characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and where   possible,
              isolable ionic salts will be crystallized and X-ray crystal   structures
              determined.   Theoretical calculations will be carried out in   conjunction
              with the experimental work.  New ways will be attempted to   prepare simple but
              elusive carbocations - allyl, benzyl, cyclohexy, and   phenyl - as well as more
              complex polycations such as   2,4,6-trisubstituted-1,3,5-tribenzyl (benzene)
              trications, and   methanetetrakis(para-cumyl)tetrayl tetracation.   With this
              renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is continuing
              support for Drs. George A. Olah and Golam Rasul in the   Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Southern California.  Dr.   Olah's Nobel Prize
              winning work on carbocations, or carbonium ions, was   based on his observation
              that these unstable organic species, which had   been proposed as reactive
              intermediates in organic reactions, could   actually be observed
              spectroscopically by NMR and their structures and   reactions studied in
              solution at low temperature, provided one had the   right solvents and Lewis
              acids.  These studies will provide a better   understanding of electrophilic
              reactivity in strong acids, and are   expected to lead to new synthetic methods
              in organic chemistry.  The work   will also provide valuable chemical research
              experience for postdoctoral   and graduate students.
