The proposal consists of two parts. The first section
              involves a construction technique for local noetherian rings of finite
              transcendence degree over a field.  This technique has been very powerful in
              the past; many(famous) counterexamples in commutative algebrahave been produced
              involving this technique.  The proposer will investigate if the construction
              provides a way of describing all local Noetherian domains which contain a
              coefficient field k and are of finite transcendence degree over k..  The
              proposer is also interested in applications of this construction to local
              uniformization and to Artin's conjecture on regular morphism.  The second part
              of the proposal is concerned with questions about local cohomology.

Local
              Noetherian domains that are of finite transcendence degree over a field occur
              as major building blocks in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry; they
              are ultimately involved in the description of the solution sets of algebraic
              equations. Local cohomology was developed in algebraic geometry as a tool for
              the description of solution sets of algebraic equations.
