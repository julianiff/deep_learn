This research will investigate the extent to which public
              involvement in state and federal programs to foster hazard mitigation planning
              is likely to be effective.  The research will take advantage of program
              activities now underway among local governments in states that have mandated
              the preparation of local government comprehensive plans and among local
              governments that are participating  the Federal Emergency Management agency's
              Community Rating System (CRS) and have prepared flood plain management plans. 
              Data will be gathered from a sample of 100 local governments within Florida and
              Washington.  Case studies will also be conducted in three jurisdictions with
              exemplary citizen involvement efforts in order to see if statistical results
              can be replicated using qualitative methods, shed additional light on the
              processes through which citizen involvement is, or is not, translated into
              commitment by public officials to address hazards, and to reveal how various
              public involvement techniques affect these processes.  This research will have
              implications for various kinds of natural hazards.
