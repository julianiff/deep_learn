              ABSTRACT    Alexander Merkurjev  University of California, Los Angeles  98 01646
                 This project involves algebraic K-theory of algebraic varieties and the
              theory of algebraic groups.  Professor Merkurjev intends to compute the
              K-groups of algebraic varieties with large automorphism group.  As an
              application of this certain K-cohomology groups, such as Chow groups, will be
              computed.  The investigator will also develop a theory of cohomological
              invariants of algebraic varieties and compute the group of cohomological
              invariants with coefficients in a given module.     A powerful method in the
              modern mathematics is to study an object by studying its symmetries. 
              Mathematicians have developed rather sophisticated ways of  measuring symmetry,
              and they use a mathematical object called a group to keep track of them. Very
              often the groups can be stacked into a tower of increasingly complicated
              symmetries. By looking at the tower, they can get a great deal of information
              about the basic object. Algebraic K-theory is a version of this method of
              grouping.  Professor  Merkurjev has new ideas about how to compute these towers
              for certain kinds of objects.  He hopes to use these computations to study
              algebraic varieties and algebraic groups.  These are the mathematical names for
              a collection of solutions to a set of equations and for particular collections
              of matrices.  The results of this project will add to our understanding of many
              basic pieces of mathematics.
