Abstract    :
              DEB 9801342  Hopson      Based on a rich fossil record, the reptile-to-mammal
              transition has long  been considered the best-supported example of the origin
              of a major  vertebrate group.  This study will examine several prominent
              hypotheses  concerning the tempo and directionality of pre-mammalian synapsid 
              evolution.  Using phylogenetic estimates based on recent cladistic analyses 
              and a battery of morphometric techniques, my research will address 
              analytically previous assertions of: (1) the prominent role of  morphological
              convergence, including (2) the prevalence of independent  progressive trends
              towards the mammalian grade of structural organization.  The evolution of
              synapsid morphological disparity (i.e., the range of  anatomical variation)
              from "pelycosaurs" to basal mammaliaforms will be  examined using qualitative
              character descriptions, quantitative  measurements, and morphometric outline
              methods.  Results derived from the  three methods will be contrasted, and then
              (1) compared to the pattern of  diversification observed among other higher
              taxa, and (2) examined for  significant (i.e., non-random) directionality.  The
              research outlined above  integrates aspects of cladistic analysis and
              biostratigraphy with  morphometrics and the quantitative analysis of
              morphological disparity.  It  will shed light on the dynamics of synapsid
              morphological diversification,  as well as on important issues such as the
              recognition of evolutionary  trends and the distribution of convergent
              evolution.
