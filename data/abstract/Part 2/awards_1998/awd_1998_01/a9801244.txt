Abstract    :
                  98-01244  Chapin/Craine    DDIG: Nitrogen supply and root dynamics: A plant
              strategy approach    Plant ecologists are still not sure how plants grow,
              largely because little data has been collected regarding roots. Our lack of
              knowledge about plant growth and how plants interact with their environment
              compromises our ability to predict the effects of global change, including
              elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. This research
              project is designed to measure characteristics that are important in the above-
              and belowground growth of plants, and the relationship of these traits to
              ecosystem processes such as the fate of nutrients in the soil. Measurements
              include using video technology to image roots belowground in order to quantify
              when roots are produced in the year and how long a root lives, and measuring
              the influence of the live and dead roots on the ecosystem's retention of
              nitrate, an inorganic form of nitrogen that is a common pollutant of
              groundwater.
