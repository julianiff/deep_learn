Abstract    :
              ***  9801511  Wisner  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a new process for recycling painted automotive
              thermoplastics.  The use of thermoplastics to produce automotive bumpers,
              fascias, etc. began in the mid 1980's and currently consumes approximately 350
              million pounds per year.  With the average life of an automobile of 10-12
              years, hundreds of millions of pounds of valuable plastic are beginning to
              accumulate at the automotive dismantlers.  Most of this ends up in automotive
              shredder residue and subsequently in landfills.  The basic problem in recycling
              these thermoplastics is residual paint particles.  Phase I research discovered
              a process to remove the paint using partial hydrolysis and mechanical attrition
              to remove the paint.  Phase II will design, build, and operate a fully
              commercial prototype process.  The quality of thermoplastics in bumpers'
              end-of-life vehicles will be assessed from different climates of the U.S., and
              functionalized additives, designed to react with partially hydrolyzed paint,
              creating an "in situ" compatabilizer, will be explored.  The commercial goal is
              to deliver recycled plastic from both dismantlers (post consumer) and industry
              scrap (post industrial) with virgin plastic properties and reuse it in bumper
              manufacture.  This technology is expected to increase the recycling of a major
              material resource, and commercial recycling of 100 million pounds per year is
              thought to be achievable.  ***
