Abstract    :
              9801572  Givnish    This study seeks to make an important contribution toward
              describing the patterns of evolution in a striking example of continental
              adaptive radiation.  The genus Banksia (Proteaceae) includes 79 species of
              trees, shrubs, and prostrate woody mats that occur only in Australia and are
              established in a broad range of climates and soils.  Some characters vary
              greatly among the species, such as the leaves, which may vary from entire to
              spinose, and these plants display the widest range in lifespan known among
              flowering plants.   In addition several co-occuring pairs of species in Banksia
              and the related genus Dryandra are remarkably convergent in leaf and flower
              form.      A  phylogeetic tree will be developed for Banksia and relatived
              genera based on variation in chloroplast and nuclear DNA.  Once resolved the
              tree will be used for the following purposes:  1) analysis of the agreement
              between our DNA data and a recent set of morphological data with the aim of
              obtaining a classification of Banksia based on both kinds of information; 2)
              evaluation of the history of species formation within and between different
              geographic areas; 3) relating evolutionary shifts in plant form and ecology to
              inferred historical shifts to different climates and/or substrates; and 4)
              determination of whether the strikingly similarity between coexisting pairs of
              Banksia and Dryandra species represents evolutionary convergence under similar
              ecological conditions or the sharing of recent common ancestors.  The proposed
              study will shed light on the history, geographic distribution, and ecology of
              one of the most diverse and characteristic groups of Australia's vegetation.
