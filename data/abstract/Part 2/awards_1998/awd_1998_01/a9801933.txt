Abstract    :
              This Dissertation Improvement research examines the processes by which Chinese
              workers cope with job dislocation, in the context of rapidly changing
              socio-economic conditions.  In searching for new jobs, will these dislocated
              workers be more likely to use the government re-employment program; rely on
              their social networks; or utilize individualistic impersonal methods? How
              successful will the workers be in acquiring a new job and for what reasons will
              they be successful?    Three paradigms provide competing predictions and
              explanations:  First, neoclassical theory implies that dislocated workers will
              use individualistic impersonal methods and that their human capital will be the
              primary factor determining their success in finding a new job.  Second, an
              "East Asian" paradigm predicts that the workers will turn to China's
              re-employment program and that human capital will be the primary reason that
              people will find new jobs.  And third, a sociological paradigm predicts that
              workers will use their social networks and that social capital will be the
              primary factor determining worker success in finding a new job. This research
              will assess these three competing theoretical claims, through a survey of 800
              randomly selected dislocated workers in Tianjin, China between August 1998 and
              June 1999.     In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
              research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the
              thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
