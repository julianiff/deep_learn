Abstract    :
              ***  9801444  Hunt    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will address the application of catalytic films on the anodic and cathodic
              sides of proton conducting fuel-oxidant separation membranes.  In the case of
              proton exchange membranes (PEMs), such as NAFION, catalytic films have been
              applied by several methods with varying degrees of success.  Most methods that
              yield high performance fuel cells are far too expensive for mass-market
              applications.  The Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) is a strong
              candidate to provide a low-cost solution for catalytic coatings onto PEMS. 
              CCVD's primary advantage is the ability to deposit high quality thin films in
              the open atmosphere in a production friendly manner.  The process uses simple,
              low-cost equipment and relatively inexpensive precursors of the materials to be
              coated.  The Phase I effort proved that CCVD could effectively deposit platinum
              onto a NAFION membrane to produce a functioning fuel cell assembly without any
              measurable deterioration of the PEM.  Phase II research will focus on
              construction of a prototype coating system, resolution of scalability issues,
              and performance achievement.    The billion-dollar fuel cell opportunity range
              from spacecraft to stationary and transportation energy sources.  If funded,
              the low cost CCVD technology can play an important role in the widespread
              commercialization of PEM fuel cell technology.      ***
