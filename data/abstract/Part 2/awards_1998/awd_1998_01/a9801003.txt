Abstract    :
                  ***  9801003  Timoc    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a special-purpose correlator integrated circuit for
              correlation spectroscopy in radio-astronomy observations at millimeter and
              sub-millimeter wavelengths.  A laboratory prototype of a correlator chip was
              developed, fabricated, and tested in Phase I to provide the critical design
              information for the development of a larger correlator chip planned for Phase
              II. The technical objectives were successfully achieved with a 1 28-lag, 4
              quantization levels, correlator chip demonstrated to operate at maximum
              bandwidth of 660 MHz.  The technical objectives of Phase II are to design,
              fabricate, test, and evaluate a new generation of special-purpose correlator
              chips with the following characteristics: a) a minimum of 500 MH~ bandwidths,
              b) a total of ~56 lags per chip partitioned in two independent correlators with
              128 lags each. c) four quantization levels, d) a 32-bit integration counter per
              lag, and e) quadruple buffering for each lag.  To reach this unprecedented
              level of performance, the proposed correlator chips will employ an innovative
              on-chip parallel processing architecture.  Reliable operation at a clock
              frequency of 500 MHz will be achieved with a combination of: bit-systolic
              arrays, a novel family of hyper-frequency CMOS digital circuits, and an
              advanced 0.5 um CMOS fabrication process.      The proposing firm's business
              plan is to focus on the research, development, marketing, selling, technical
              support, and maintenance of a family of state-of-the-art correlator chips and
              spectrometers with application in radio astronomy, atmospheric science,
              cellular phones frequency allocation. and radio-frequency surveillance.  ***
