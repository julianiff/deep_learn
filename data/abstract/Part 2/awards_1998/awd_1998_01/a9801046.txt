     The research proposed is concerned with
              the study of fourth order
problems which arise in spectral theory, and
              involve: existence and 
regularity questions for non-linear partial
              differential equations, 
asymptotics of an elliptic equation which arises in
              conformal geometry, 
and its relation to the determination of the best
              constant in a
Sobolev imbedding.

     The need for the study of partial
              differential equations is due to
their central importance in every manner of
              "real world" problems:  from 
CAT scan machines to the spread of diseases,
              from jet engine design to 
computer visualization.  The work supported by this
              grant is concerned 
with some basic questions about "fourth order" equations,
              a field that has 
a lot of open and very interesting questions, and the
              relation of these 
equations to other fields of mathematics, especially
              geometry.
