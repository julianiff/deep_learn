A reductive p-adic group is the special collection of
              symmetries of an arithmetic or geometric object.  This study is expected to
              unravel intricate and fundamental properties of the objects and patterns which
              are of interest in arithmetic and geometry through the study of these
              symmetries.  One way to understand a group of symmetries is through a
              representation of its elements as matrices.  Representation theory does this in
              a systematic way.  Ultimately the goal is to we are able to construct and
              classify all representations of the reductive p-adic groups, and from this
              settle important questions about the underlying geometric object.  This is
              important because so many interesting arithmetic and geometric objects have
              interesting symmetries that form a reductive
p-adic group. 

This research
              comes under the umbrella of harmonic analysis on topological groups.  Group
              theory and harmonic analysis are a part of the fundamental underpinnings of
              certain applications of mathematics to technology in such fields as error
              correcting codes for efficient and reliable communication and computer imaging,
              eg. medical imaging, geological imaging or planetary imaging.
