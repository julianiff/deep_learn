Abstract    :
              ***  9801247  Squillante  Macromolecular crystallography is a very important
              technique for determining structures of complex biological systems such as
              proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses.  Due to such research on the atomic
              level, the understanding of important biological processes such as enzyme
              catalysis, viral infection, immune response, hereditary information encoding,
              and photosynthesis has increased considerably.  Currently, detectors used in
              crystallography include films, CCDS, and storage phosphors.  All of these
              detectors have serious drawbacks in terms of convenience, performance, size,
              stability or cost.  Hence there is a real need for better imaging detectors in
              macromolecular research.  In particular, large area detectors, with good
              sensitivity, high spatial resolution and low cost are needed to facilitate
              rapid progress in biological crystallography under typical laboratory
              conditions.  To address this situation, we propose to develop a solid state,
              large area, high resolution imaging detector by combining semiconductor film
              (lead iodide) technology being developed at RMD with the large format amorphous
              silicon readout technology which has been developed by our collaborator, Dr.
              Street, at Xerox PARC.  Dr. Westbrook at Argonne National Laboratory will also
              collaborate in the proposed effort and his group will be involved in developing
              low noise electronics for the detector as well as in conducting macromolecular
              diffraction studies.  X-Ray Diffraction, Nondestructive Testing, Mammography,
