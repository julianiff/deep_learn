The investigators work on three aspects of the
              foundations of Bayesian
statistics and decision theory:  (i)   They develop
              measures of incoherence which permit them to quantify the extent to which
              non-Bayesian procedures violate principles of subjective expected utility. 
              (ii)  They implement algorithms for assessing partially ordered preferences,
              according to their representation in terms of sets of agreeing
              probability/utility pairs.  These are relevant for modeling Pareto consensus of
              a group of coherent (Bayesian) expert decision makers.  (iii) They explore
              connections between merely finitely additive probability and valid computations
              with "improper" priors, in the context of so-called "Marginalization"
              paradoxes.

Bayesian statistics aims to put statistics on a sound theoretical
              footing by modeling a rational statistical decision maker as if he or she were
              a bookie, announcing probabilities which act as prices at which risky bets can
              be bought or sold. An important general result is that a bookie either behaves
              as a Bayesian, or would accept a series of bets that would make the bookie a
              sure loser.  The investigators explore extensions of this theory to account for
              non-Bayesian behavior, groups of bookies, and more general interpretations of
              probability.
