Abstract    :
                This award is to purchase a portable photosynthesis system  that is integrated
              with a fluorescence monitoring system and  a portable leaf area meter with a
              transport belt conveyor  accessory.  These instruments will be used in ongoing
              and  newly planned projects in which measured photosynthetic  rates will be
              correlated with developmental, symbiotic, and  ecological factors.  The
              research projects supported include  the role of photosynthesis in the growth
              strategy and  biomass allocation of clonal species in wetland ecosystems,  the
              process of leaf senescence induced by the presence of  maturing fruits in bean
              plants, and the use of CO2 fixation  rates as an accurate predictor of
              nodulation and the rate of  nitrogen fixation in the actinorhizal plant
              Elaeagnus  umbellata.  The purchase of the instrumentation will also  help
              expand the range of available student research  projects, and thus will serve
              as a critical resource for  training undergraduate science students at Ithaca
              College.
