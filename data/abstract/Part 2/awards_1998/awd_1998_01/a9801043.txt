Abstract    :
              ***  98011043  Ivkovich   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will develop a feedback system for welders whereby work instructions
              and simplified data on the state of a weld will be displayed in the welder's
              helmet.  These data, communicated by remote telemetry to the welder's helmet,
              will enable an average welder to perform with the skill of a master welder. 
              Phase I produced a weld monitoring system and a prototype helmet wired to the
              monitor.  Phase II will extend the sensing system and configure the data link
              to the helmet for wireless operation.  Consultation with potential industrial
              users will be effected through the the National Center for Manufacturing
              Sciences.  Commercial applications of the technology are anticipated where high
              quality and high reliability manual welding are needed, such as Gas Metal Arc
              Welding (GMAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) processes in the automotive,
              aerospace, heavy manufacturing, ship-building, oil, petrochemical, power
              generation, and manufacturing machinery industries.  ***
