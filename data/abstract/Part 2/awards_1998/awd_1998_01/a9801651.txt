Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of
              Molecular and Cellular Biology, Mathies will continue time resolved Raman
              studies of biomolecules.  Specifically he proposes (I) resonance Raman
              spectroscopic studies of the structure and dynamics of the 'solvated electron';
              (II) time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopic studies of chromophore
              dynamics in rhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin and phytochrome using femtosecond
              Raman gain spectroscopy (FRGS); and (III) time resolved (ns, ps) UV resonance
              Raman spectroscopic studies of protein dynamics in rhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin
              and phytochrome by monitoring the Trp and Try residues after photolysis.
              

These investigations probe the basics of the interaction between light and
              photo-biologically active materials and will contribute to our understanding of
              the fundamental processes which take place in animate and inanimate living
              systems.  The overall goal of this research is to find general principles about
              how chemical reactions occur in condensed phase photochemical systems at room
              temperature.
