Abstract    :
                        9801647  Katzarkov    This award provides support for a conference on
              motives, polylogarithms, and Hodge theory to be held at the University of
              California Irvine. Twenty years ago, S. Bloch gave his famous lecture series on
              the theory of dilogarithms in Irvine. These insightful lectures laid the
              foundation of a theory that combined Grothendieck's theory of motives with
              algebraic K-theory and number theory. Remarkably, each topic and example from
              Bloch's original treatment has become an active area leading to new discoveries
              or growing into a subject in its own right.  Two major programs have recently
              emerged in the boundary zone between algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory and
              Hodge theory. The first is stable homotopy theory of algebraic varieties, and
              the second is non-abelian Hodge theory.  Twenty years later is a good time to
              look back and see where the fields stand. By gathering researchers in all of
              these fields, the organizers hope to stimulate a creative atmosphere that will
              lead to many new exciting discoveries.     This conference is in the field of
              algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
              mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
              quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in
              the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology,
              and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical  computer science, and robotics.
