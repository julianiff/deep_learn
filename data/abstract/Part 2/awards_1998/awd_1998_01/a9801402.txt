Abstract    :
                  ***  9801402  Sibold    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will develop a low cost process for toughening alumina ceramics. 
              These materials are widely used in anti-wear, anti-corrosion, and electrical
              insulation applications in many industries.  However, markets remain limited
              because of the brittleness of these ceramics.  While tough ceramics are
              available, they are six to 50 times more costly than alumina.  Phase I
              developed a simple water-based infiltration process that increased the fracture
              toughness of a commercial alumina ceramic by as much as 25% with only 50%
              increase in material cost.  The process was performed on simple fracture
              toughness testing specimens.  Phase II will develop an optimized process and
              material with the microstructure and fracture toughness that can be made easily
              and inexpensively by a commercial ceramics manufacturer.  The primary objective
              is a production process for tough, damage tolerant ceramics, which can be used
              in place of normally brittle ceramics.      The anticipated increase in
              toughness of low cost alumina ceramics will significantly expand the commercial
              applications for technical ceramics.  ***
