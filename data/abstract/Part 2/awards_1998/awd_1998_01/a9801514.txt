Abstract    :
              ***  9801514  Kalumuck  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              is aimed at the development of an efficient cost effective technology for
              treatment of water polluted with organic waste compounds by complete oxidation.
               Such materials pose a major environmental health hazard at numerous industrial
              sites and laboratory facilities threatening air pollution and ground water
              contamination.  However, complete oxidation by conventional means entails
              costly chemical treatment and often leads to carcinogenic end products.  The
              proposed research applies hydrodynamic cavitation to induce oxidation in the
              bulk solution by the use of cavitating liquid jets to trigger wide spread
              cavitation.  The Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of this approach
              by producing energy efficiencies of oxidation two orders of magnitude larger
              than those obtained with ultrasonic means.  Phase II will seek to obtain a
              detailed mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling this process,
              extend its application to different classes of compounds, optimize cavitation
              and operating conditions, establish scaling laws, and address practical
              engineering issues relevant to commercialization.  A detailed study of the
              cavitation characteristics and their influence on the oxidation of different
              classes of compounds and their byproducts will be conducted.  The Technology
              will provide a reliable cost effective means for waste handling and elimination
              of a broad range of toxic organic compounds leading to safe end products.  It
              will be of use to industries as well as government facilities in disposing of
              the huge quantities of toxic substances continually being produced and
              previously accumulated.  ***
