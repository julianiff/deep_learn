Abstract    :
                        9801297  Dillon   Predictions of major climatic impacts in the
              Americas from developing El Nino conditions include greatly increased rainfall
              in deserts of northern South America. Past El Nino conditions, in 1982 and
              again in 1987, led to dramatic increases in the appearance of flowering plants
              in the very dry deserts of coastal Chile and Peru, especially in zones subject
              to regular fogs and known as "lomas" communities. For many years the botanist
              Dr. Michael Dillon of the Field Museum of Natural History and his ecologist
              colleague Dr. Philip Rundel, working with Chilean and Peruvian colleagues, have
              been studying the flora and vegetation of these hyper arid regions. They have
              amassed specimens and associated observational data documenting the occurrence
              of 1175 species of flowering plants, placed in 418 genera in 97 families, in
              various lomas formations in the two countries. Many of these are rare or
              ephemeral in occurrence, and for most little is known about seed longevity in
              the soil and germination requirements, or about growth and development to
              reproduction. Long term monitoring of basic ecological information, like
              vegetation cover, composition, and turnover, has been possible at just a few
              field sites, in collaboration with host-country colleagues.   Expedited funding
              through this Small Grant for Exploratory Research program makes it possible to
              respond promptly to the opportunity for floristic and ecological monitoring of
              desert regions in northern Chile and southern Peru, during the impending ENSO
              event. Species changes will be integrated with existing databases know
              accessible through the Web, and authenticated by specimen collections at the
              Field Museum and elsewhere. Ecological monitoring will lay the basis for more
              sophisticated studies on drought tolerance in relation to photosynthetic
              pathways and water relations. Field work this coming year will make possible
              direct comparison with floristic and vegetational conditions documented from
              previous El Nino years.
