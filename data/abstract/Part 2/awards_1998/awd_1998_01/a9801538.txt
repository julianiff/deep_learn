It is often assumed that evolutionary specialization by an
              organism must lead to losses of performance and functionality in other
              environments, but there is little evidence to support this theory.  Part of
              this uncertainty stems from a problem of perception: how does one operationally
              define a specialist? Also, a paucity of direct experimentation has limited the
              consideration of alternative population genetic processes that can lead to such
              losses of function.  We describe here a long-term experiment in which twelve
              populations of the bacterium, Escherichia coli, have evolved in the laboratory
              for 20,000 generations.  During this time, all of the populations became
              progressively better adapted to growth in a simple glucose-limited environment.
               We will examine the consequences of this evolution for the bacteria's capacity
              to utilize a variety of substrates other than glucose, and thereby quantify the
              extent to which specialization led to losses of function.  We will also
              evaluate the relative contributions of two population processes, tradeoffs
              (antagonistic pleiotropy) and drift (mutation accumulation), to the observed
              changes in function.
