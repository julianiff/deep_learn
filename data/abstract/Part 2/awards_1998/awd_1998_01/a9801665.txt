Abstract    :
              9801665  Schmitz  This proposal integrates components of population ecology and
              community ecology to investigate the biological and environmental factors that
              limit the distribution and abundance of a grasshopper species in New England
              old fields. This research will identify how variation in abiotic and biotic
              ecological factors shape the population ecology and subsequent distribution of
              Melanoplus femurrubrum. Field surveys demonstrated that this grasshopper is a
              generalist feeder that prefers grass resources that is restricted to old fields
              with less than 60% grass cover. Preliminary and ongoing research have indicated
              that competition and predation do not appear to be significant limiting factors
              for this species in these old fields. Based on this, two experiments will be
              performed. The first proposed set of experiments tests the hypothesis that bird
              and small mammal predators are the major limiting factors of M. femurrubrum.
              The second set of experiments tests the hypothesis that the distribution of
              this grasshopper is limited by the success of oviposition site selection and
              egg development. Overall, this research targets major hypotheses about the
              distribution of an insect of wide range and economic importance in a landscape
              heavily influenced by human activities, making this study relevant to basic
              ecology in the context of a human altered landscape.
