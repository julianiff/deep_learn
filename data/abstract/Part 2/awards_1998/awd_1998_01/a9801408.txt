Abstract    :
              9801408  Monson  The mechanisms responsible for the observed microbial
              population dynamics in the Colorado alpine tundra will be investigated by
              performing experiments on bacteria and fungi isolated from the soil. The
              culture collection will be screened for those isolates that are abundant at
              some part of the year using dot blot hybridization techniques, which measure
              the quantity of isolate-specific DNA that is present in a sample of DNA
              extracted from the soil. This process will identify the most ecologically
              relevant isolates for use in later experiments. These organisms will be
              classified using fatty acid analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing. The environmental
              limits (temperature range, substrate-utilization patterns, and resistance to
              freezing and osmotic stress) will be characterized for the selected isolates,
              and this data will be used to test hypotheses about the cause of the observed
              community shift. The seasonal community shift is central to the alpine N cycle
              because during the transitional period between the two community types, the
              winter microbial biomass releases a large pulse of N to plants shortly after
              snowmelt. By linking observed patterns of whole-soil processes to physiological
              properties of the dominant microorganisms, the work will provide the first
              truly mechanistic description of a terrestrial N cycle.
