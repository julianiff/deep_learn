Abstract    :
              ***  9801239  Singhal             This Small Business Innovation
              Research(SBIR)Phase II project will further develop, validate and demonstrate
              the Probability Density Function (PDF) cavitation model for multi-dimensional
              steady and transient simulations of cavitating flows. Phase I has shown the
              feasibility and benefits of including the effects of turbulent pressure
              fluctuations on phase change rate, by using a   PDF approach. While this effect
              has, as postulated, improved both the accuracy and numerical stability of
              solutions, further study is needed to account for additional physical phenomena
              such as bubble dynamics and presence of non-condensable gases. The Phase II
              effort will focus on a) developing appropriate functions for phase change rates
              by making use of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and partial pressure concepts,
              and b) improving robustness and efficiency of the iterative solution process.
              Each modification will be systematically assessed by comparing numerical
              solutions against selected benchmark data, covering wide range of problems and
              flow conditions. The final model will be applied to three classes of problems
              from aerospace, naval/marine, and automotive industry             The developed
              cavitation model will enable improved designs of engineering equipment using
              pumps, propellers, orifices, hydrofoils, and hydrostatic bearings and
              biomedical devices such as mechanical heart valves. The cavitation model will
              be useable with cooercial programs.  ***
