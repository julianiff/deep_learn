Abstract    :
              9801449     Davis    This proposal will establish a full-Holocene
              paleoenvironment record for the Southern California Mountain region.  This
              record will be used to infer past climates for the regions and these, in turn,
              will be used to test simulations of past regional climates derived from
              mathematical global climate models.  These tests are necessary to validate such
              models and their use in forecasting future climates.    Fossil pollen preserved
              in mountain meadow sediments will be the primary indicator of past climate
              conditions.  In addition, pollen data will be combined with charcoal, other
              plant fossils, and the physical characteristics of sediments to infer past
              conditions.  Comparison of fossil pollen assemblages to those representative of
              model vegetation will be a primary method for analysis.  Similar fossil and
              modern pollen data will be used to infer similarity in past and present
              vegetation, and therefore climate at a site.    Initial pollen counts suggest
              that the early Holocene in S.Calif. Mountains was not much different than
              present-day conditions.  This contrasts with the relatively dry conditions that
              have been inferred for the Sierra Nevada and Pacific Northwest and is
              consistent with climate-model simulation of enhanced monsoonal flow into the
              Southwest.  The results of our analyses will improve the spatial resolution of
              the paleoenvironmental record in the Southwest.
