	Accurate non-perturbative approaches are developed and
              applied to investigate the classical and quantal dynamics of 3D Rydberg atoms
              in the presence of external fields.  The projects include the spectroscopy and
              dynamics of Rydberg atoms in crossed magnetic and electric fields and the
              structure and dynamics of Rydberg atoms in circularly and elliptically
              polarized microwave fields.
