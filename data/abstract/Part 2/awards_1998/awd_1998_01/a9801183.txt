Abstract    :
              ***  9801183  Bryant  This SBIR Phase II project will continue the Phase I
              effort that investigated the use of microencapsulated water and phase change
              materials (PCM) microcapsules to improve biological herbicides (mycoherbicides)
              and offer a safe, host-specific, affordable alternative to chemical herbicides.
               The Phase I project successfully addressed the potential of regulating both
              the temperature and moisture (extending dew period) on a plant leaf surface
              (phyllosphere), both vital to the effectiveness of mycoherbicides. The topics
              to be studied in Phase II include, but are not limited to: (a) optimization of
              the microPCM type and concentration, (b) optimization of the application and
              concentration of the water microcapsules, (c) investigation of the optimum
              types of application systems, including spraying equipment and surfactants, (d)
              measurement of leaf surface temperature and moisture in response to
              microencapsulated materials and the relation of this to effectiveness, (e)
              performing field test(s) with the microencapsulated materials and the target
              mycoherbicide, and (f) expanding the technology to additional candidate
              mycoherbicides.  At the end of the proposed Phase II effort, it is anticipated
              that the microencapsulated materials will be characterized to the point where
              commercial applicability in the agricultural arena can be confidently
              undertaken for rapid development with our Phase III sponsors.  Many promising
              mycoherbicides have not been developed because of critical environmental
              conditions in the field. Successful development of the microencapsulated
              materials would significantly improve existing mycoherbicides, renew the
              development of previously abandoned mycoherbicides, and create broad
              applications in agriculture and environmental systems in the herbicide
              industry, which currently has annual sales over of 7 billion dollars.  ***
