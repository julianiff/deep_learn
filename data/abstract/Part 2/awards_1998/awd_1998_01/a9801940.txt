Abstract    :
              9801940   Dierking      The Institute for Learning Innovation, Inc., requests
              $264,904 to pilot a project for establishing a national program to provide
              parents and significant other adults with support, training and materials.
              Also, the project goals will enable parents and other adults to become actively
              engaged in local science education reform and science literacy for their
              children.  The duration of this project is eighteen months.  The cost sharing
              for this NSF award is 24.6% of the total projected cost of the project.   The
              Institute for Learning Innovation, Inc. will collaborate with the YWCA of
              Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis and the
              Arundel County Public Schools' Family Involvement Center.  Project "ASK with
              Science" will develop a model program for implementing and disseminating
              science education materials to young children in underserved communities,
              thereby creating a grassroots, family-oriented program that can become
              established in the local communities served by these organizations.
