Abstract    :
              ESI-9801774  Anderson    The Vermont Center for the Book currently reaches over
              1,000 parents in Vermont through the informal science education program, Mother
              Goose Asks "Why?."   Through the program, exemplary children's literature and
              related science activities are brought to parents of preschool children in a
              series of four reading/discussion/activity sessions.   Participants explore
              such questions as "What Is It?", "How Many", "How Do You Do It?", and "How Does
              It Grow?" and gain the expertise and confidence to introduce science to their
              3-7 year old children.  Many of the parents involved are reached through
              programs such as Head Start, Adult Basic Education, and Parent Centers.    In
              this current project, the Vermont Center for the Book with make the program
              available to parents in 12 other states, the District of Columbia, and the
              Virgin Islands by equipping their state libraries and state centers for the
              book to conduct the program in local libraries and library service outreach
              sites in housing projects, on Native American reservations and in prisons.  
              The Vermont Center will train library professionals in the content and process
              of the program and provide technical support as the new sites begin
              implementation of the program.   At the same time, the Vermont Center will
              create another program, "You Can Count on Mother Goose," that will be based in
              books and activities through which parents can introduce their preschool
              children to basic mathematics ideas.  Once created and field-tested, this new
              program will be disseminated to all of the participating sites.
