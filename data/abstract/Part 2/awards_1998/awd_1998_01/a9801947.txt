Abstract    :
              9801947  Baragiola      Dr. Raul Baragiola, University of Virginia, will
              investigate the surface properties of ice, especially under the bombardment of
              ions.  He has designed a series of laboratory experiments on water ice and
              other ices to investigate morphological and chemical effects in ices under
              physical conditions relevant to the surfaces of planetary satellites.  The
              focus is on physical and chemical properties that have manifestations in the
              remote sensing of surfaces by optical reflectance from the ultraviolet to the
              infrared.  The studies will simulate processes on icy satellites, especially
              those induced by ultraviolet radiation and ions that are also important for
              comets and planetary rings.  Besides the fundamental interest in understanding
              bodies in the Solar System, the research has applications in many areas, such
              as remote sensing of ices on Earth, physics and chemistry of mesospheric ice
              grains, processing of materials by ions and photons, radiation effects in
              biological tissue, and exobiology.
