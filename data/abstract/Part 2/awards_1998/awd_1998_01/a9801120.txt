Abstract    :
               ***  9801120  Gerrard  In an era of decreasing funding for school construction
              and increasing student enrollment, school district administrators and concerned
              individuals are faced with many complex and sensitive decisions.  In general
              terms, the School District Planning Problem (SDPP) may be defined as how to
              manipulate school district site capacities and attendance boundaries to
              optimally manage school district resources over the long term.  This Small
              Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on the research,
              design, and prototype development of Group Spatial Decision Support System
              (GSDSS) that will assist public school district officials and concerned
              individuals in the task of identifying, evaluating, and implementing effective
              solutions to the School District Planning Problem (SDPP).  The system will
              enable decision-makers to build models of school district enrollment with
              user-defined objectives and constraints, simulate facility capacity
              alternatives, optimize school boundary configurations, and facilitate
              negotiation and consensus building in the politically-charged school planning
              environment.  The system will facilitate the development of alternative
              long-term, cost-effective, and minimally disruptive strategies for school
              district planning that are sensitive to political reality as well as to the
              traditional fiscal and educational goals of district management.  The proposed
              system will contain several innovative optimization models and fast, efficient
              solution procedures, as well as a map-based graphical use interface and
              built-in group-based consensus-building techniques.   The development and
              commercialization of the proposed GSDSS can provide significant benefits not
              only to local school districts and communities, but also to the national
              education agenda as a whole resulting in a legacy of more effective educational
              systems nationwide.  The proposed GSDSS for school district management has
              excellent prospects for commercial application.  Assuming that the potenti al
              market includes school districts that serve more than 2,500 students, then
              there were approximately 3,800 districts in the market in l99S.  Such districts
              represented only 26 percent of all districts in the U.S., but they contained
              more than 80 percent of all enrolled students.  ***
