Abstract    :
              9801259   Donoghue    Phylogenetic and comparative analyses will be used to
              examine the evolution of interactions between dioecious figs (Moraceae: Ficus
              subg. Ficus) and their pollinating fig wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaoninae).  Paired
              collections of dioecious figs and fig wasps from the field were made by Weiblen
              during 1995-1997.  Morphological and molecular data from these collections will
              be used in parallel phylogenetic analyses.  The internal transcribed spacer
              (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA from selected fig species and the 3' end
              of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) from fig wasps will be sequenced. 
              The extensive fig wasp collections at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie,
              Leiden, The Netherlands, will be used to confirm the identities of selected
              pollinator species and to explore morphological characters.  Scanning electron
              microscopy will document fig and fig wasp morphological characters used in
              phylogenetic and comparative analyses.   Comparative studies are designed to
              evaluate coevolutionary hypotheses in a phylogenetic context, including
              parallel diversification and cases of reciprocal adaptations between
              interacting lineages.
