Abstract    :
              ***  9801506  McAlindon  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project submitted by McAlindon Enterprises, Inc proposes to develop a new
              alphanumeric input device (AID) to address the ergonomic and efficiency needs
              of users who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and also of users with
              other physical disabilities.  This AID would allow a new approach to typing. 
              It uses a pair of devices; each comprised of a dome upon which the hands
              comfortably rest.  Its typing methodology entails creating a keystroke via a
              combination of positions of the two domes called 'chording.'  Phase I research
              investigated how ergonomic, biomechanical, and typing performances on this new
              device compared to an ergonomically designed keyboard and the flat QWERTY
              keyboard.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing dome travel and actuating
              force, optimizing character layout, and extended testing of the AID-CTS
              prototype including skill acquisition.  Using keyboards is a ubiquitous fact of
              the modern workplace.   Within this context, CTS is a growing problem.  If
              successful, the project proffers a keyboard with significant implications for
              human comfort and uninterrupted productivity as well as for the reduction of
              insurance claims.   ***
