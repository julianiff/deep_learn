Abstract    :
              Abstract  9801067  Gupta/Auburn University    The objective is an exploratory
              research on the generation of nanoparticles in an expansion jet of
              supercritical solvent solutions in the presence of an ultrasound field.  The
              ultrasound field is placed orthogonal to the solution jet, and it is expected
              that will increase the mixing rate of the antisolvent in solution, and will
              create a drift velocity for the particles.  The technique will be tested by the
              formation of polymer nanoparticles both with and without encapsulation of other
              materials.  The addition of the ultrasound field is expected to reduce the
              range of particle sizes by about 100 times.  If successful, the research will
              have impact on generation of fine particles and advanced materials.
