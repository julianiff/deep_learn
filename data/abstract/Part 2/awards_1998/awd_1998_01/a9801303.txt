Abstract    :
               9801303  Williamson   This Small Business Research Innovation Research Phase II
              project  focuses on the development of a state of the art parameter estimation
              software package.  Many phenomena in science and engineering are modeled by
              systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  Often, although it is
              possible to write out the ODEs which govern the system, the coefficients or
              parameters which describe the rate of the various processes are not known.  If
              the researcher has experimental data describing the operation of the system, it
              can be used to estimate the parameters.  The process of numerically determining
              these parameters is known as parameter identification or estimation.  Parameter
              identification problems are common in many areas, including chemical kinetics,
              thermodynamics, combustion, population modeling in biological systems, and
              pharmacology.  Unfortunately, these problems can be extremely difficult for all
              but the simplest problems, and there are currently no sufficiently robust
              commercial or public domain codes.  During Phase I, the firm demonstrated that
              the proposed domain decomposition-based algorithm was more robust than standard
              methods for parameter estimation.   The objectives of Phase II are further
              design and implementation to improve the robustness and computational
              efficiency of the method to yield a viable commercial software package.   
              Parameter estimation is common in many scientific and engineering disciplines,
              but there is no readily available, reliable software for non-specialist users. 
              Thus, the market for a robust and relatively easy to use parameter estimation
              code is substantial.  Since the potential user base is highly educated and able
              to pay relatively high prices for a package that conveniently solves their
              problems, the commercial potential of this project is substantial.
