Abstract    :
              9801217  Vitousek  Empirical and theoretical work on the feedbacks between the
              terrestrial biosphere and rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has
              demonstrated that the capacity of many ecosystems to increase carbon (C) uptake
              and storage is strongly influenced by the availability of limiting resources,
              particularly nitrogen (N). Biological N-fixation is a major source of N to many
              terrestrial systems and is responsive to changes in environmental conditions.
              As a result, the response of N fixers to elevated CO2 is likely to affect
              ecosystem responses through changes in N-availability.  Two experiments will be
              carried out in a California annual grassland ecosystem. The first will measure
              the timing and magnitude of growth and N-fixation under elevated CO2 to
              determine whether growth responses can be equated with changes in biological
              N-inputs. Biomass, allocation, and N-fixing activity of 3 legumes grown under
              ambient and elevated CO2 will be measured over the course of the growing
              season. Experiment 2 will test the effects of elevated CO2 on N-fixing and
              non-fixing plants grown together and separately along a gradient of
              N-availability. Primary measurements include biomass and allocation responses,
              the contribution of plant N derived from N-fixation, and changes in tissue
              chemistry of fixers and non-fixers.
