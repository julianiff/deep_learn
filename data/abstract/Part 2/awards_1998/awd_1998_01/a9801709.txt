Abstract    :
              Investigators have demonstrated the nonlinear evolution of gradient-drift
              instabilities account for principal features of type-II irregularities in the
              daytime equatorial electrojet.  They are now conducting a comprehensive
              research program for structures in both daytime and nighttime.  Specifically,
              investigators are:  (1) thoroughly exploring the linear instability spectrum,
              and resulting two dimensional turbulence resulting from these instabilities
              nonlinear growth; (2) using measured density and electric field profiles; (3)
              clarifying the role of short-wavelength instabilities in the presence of
              dominant kilometer-scale structures; and (4) comparing several key aspects of
              observations with the high-resolution, full Doppler spectra of electron
              velocities obtained from Jicamarca.
