Abstract    :
              9801870  Fung   This project studies interactions between helices in the
              tetramerization site of human erythrocyte spectrin dimer using recombinant
              peptides consisting of specific spectrin fragments.  Spin label electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods will be used to study the N- terminal
              region of an alpha peptide (a fragment consisting of the first 368 amino-acid
              residues of human alpha- spectrin, Sp alpha 1-368) and the C-terminal region of
              a Beta-peptide (the exact nature of this peptide to be determined in this
              project).  These regions of spectrin have been suggested to be the
              tetramerization site of spectrin.  Site directed mutagenesis will be performed
              on the Sp alpha1-368 peptide to remove native cysteine residues, followed by
              replacement of a native residue at one or two specific positions (between
              residues 1 to 52) by cysteine residue for spin labeling.  Singly labeled and
              doubly labeled Sp alpha 1-368 peptides will be used for EPR studies. Similar
              approaches will be used on the Beta-peptide.     This project will determine
              whether the N-terminal region of the alpha-spectrin and the C-terminal region
              of the Beta-spectrin consist of either all alpha-helical structure or a
              combination of alpha-helical and other types of structure.  Further insight
              will be obtained on how the (30 residues (residues 20 - 52) in the
              alpha-spectrin N-terminal region associate with the (70 residues (residues
              (2010 - 2080) in the Beta-spectrin C terminal region.  Thus, the work will
              provide substantial advances in understanding the structure-function
              relationship for human erythrocyte spectrin.
