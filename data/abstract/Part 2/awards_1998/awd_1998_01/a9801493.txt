Abstract    :
              ***  9801493  Owen  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              develops, constructs, and deploys a Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor (COPS) array
              of fiber-optics based sensors.  COPS uses digital holography and
              wavelet-transform optical correlation to record and analyze ocean particulates.
               Identification of the opportunity: Detailed characterization of particulates
              is central to understanding the subsea environment.  COPS measures particulates
              at a variety of scattered sites with a collection of holographic sensors linked
              to a central data processor.  Important applications include the measurement of
              particle settling velocities and the analysis of bio-geochemical processes in
              aquatic systems.  Research objective: To build and verify a collection of COPS
              sensors.  Each COPS sensor records a 3-D field of particulates for wavelet
              analysis and classification.  Research description: COPS sensors will be
              constructed, tested, and refined through a series of sea trials.  Several
              sensors will be deployed in concert to verify the capabilities of a full COPS
              monitoring array.  Anticipated results: COPS design will emphasize autonomous
              operation, low-power requirements, and biofouling resistance.  A COPS array
              should operate in-situ for several weeks without operator attention. 
              Commercial applications include studies of marine aggregate particle dynamics
              involving biological, chemical, and physical processes.  Other applications
              include coastal monitoring, environmental surveying, aquiculture, engineering
              turbidity, industrial facility monitoring, and underwater lidar.  ***
