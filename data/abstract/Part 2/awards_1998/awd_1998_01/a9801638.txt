Abstract    :
                The goal of this research is to study an integrated theory of learning,
              knowledge representation and  reasoning and evaluate it on large scale
              knowledge intensive inferences in the natural language domain.  Recent studies,
              within the Learning to Reason framework, have shown that there is much to gain
              from  studying these issues within a unified framework.  This research
              investigates some of the fundamental  issues within this framework --
              concentrating on a probabilistic setting. The emphasis is on developing 
              algorithms that exploit the relaxation of some of the ``traditional''
              assumptions in this domain. These  include requirements put on the learning
              algorithms (e.g., learn a ``good'' density estimation),  reasoning algorithms
              (e.g., support *all* queries uniformly well) and on some of the knowledge 
              representations studied in this domain.  Application of these theories to the
              natural language domain are  studied and evaluated experimentally.  The
              emphasis is on learning methods and representations for  combining lowlevel
              learning algorithms to perform higher level inferences.  This research will
              have  impact both on understanding some of the fundamental issues involved in
              combining learning and reasoning  and will allow for making concrete progress
              towards bridging the gap between the low-level work and  higher level goals in
              the natural language domain.  http://L2R.cs.uiuc.edu/~danr/Grants/nsf98.ht  ml
