Abstract    :
              ***  9801614  Bruce    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will conduct new and innovative research into statistical methodology for long
              memory processes.  These processes can be used to model time series commonly
              encountered in geophysics, oceanography, astronomy, economics, physiology and
              other disciplines.  The essence of a long memory process is that correlation
              between observations decreases slowly as separation in time increases.  Use of
              standard time series methodology with these can lead to incorrect statistical
              analysis; e.g., confidence intervals for the mean can be unrealistically small.
               This research project will make important advances toward a complete
              methodology for long memory processes, a fundamental contribution to science. 
              The ultimate objective is to implement the research and existing methodology
              into an object-oriented software tool kit for modeling long memory time series
              for use by a broad range of statisticians, data analysts and scientists.    If
              successful, the research will lead to a software tool kit offering complete
              statistical methodology for modeling long memory time series.  The tool kit
              will be marketed as an S-PLUS module and as a MathCAD function pack and
              electronic book.  In addition, a practitioner's casebook of examples will be
              developed and marketed separately.   ***
