This proposal is on research which would use broad comparisons
              and analytical methods from continuum mechanics to identify the best design
              strategy for a fall-safe floor pad to prevent hip fracture.  The goal is a pad
              system to be laid over existing floors that behaves like a conventional hard
              floor for ordinary walking, but collapses locally beneath a bony prominence
              upon impact.  Three alternative design strategies will be investigated.  These
              strategies include the investigation of: (1) rigid and elastic foams, (2) rigid
              and elastic honeycombs, and (3) a new concept introduced in this research
              called "GranulAir".  The GranulAir concept features a top layer of granular
              material under compression, supported on an inflated bag containing baffles
              acting as tensile elements.  The goal of all three designs is to have an
              extremely nonlinear force-deflection curve, with a very steep slope for low
              stresses and a pronounced yield at a controllable applied stress.  Methods for
              comparing performance among the design alternatives include finite-element
              analysis for simulated impacts, testing of granular materials in direct shear,
              and testing of prototypes using both a servohydrolic tester for quasistatic
              measurements and a specialized impact tester (surrogate pelvis) for dynamic
              measurements.  In addition, the practical and economic aspects and an
              educational component are part of the proposal.
