Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will encompass a broad  program of studies,
              including nuclear physics, particle  physics, general relativity, and
              cosmology.  Phenomenological Studies will extract the fullest possible 
              implications of data collected from existing experiments and  those anticipated
              in the near future.  Such work is  essential in testing the validity of
              currently accepted  ideas, such as the Standard Model of elementary particles, 
              and weeding out alternate schemes which attempt to supplant  them.  Topics to
              be studied include particle decays induced  by the weak nuclear force, the
              violation of matter-  antimatter symmetry, and various applications to physical
               processes of the approximation that the lighter quarks are  massless. 
              Theoretical Studies will probe the foundation of  our most basic concepts, by
              formulating new theories which  extend what is already known.  They also will
              deepen our  knowledge of existing theories such as General Relativity,  whose
              content has not yet been fully explored.  Finally,  Educational Studies will
              serve to explain our science in  clearly understandable terms to its
              practitioners and to  students. Such contributions take the form of both books
              and  pedagogic articles.
