Abstract    :
              Some scholars have argued that minority youth reject certain ideas and actions
              perceived to be in the province of white middle class society. Further, their
              research suggests that an acceptance of  "white" language and behaviors creates
              dilemmas in the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, with serious social and
              economic implications. However, researchers have not addressed the question of
              why many minority adolescents who occupy the same or similar socioeconomic and
              sociopolitical stratum in U.S. society differ in their behaviors and attitudes
              about "acting white." The proposed dissertation project will analyze (1) how
              minority adolescent girls and boys differ in their attitudes and behaviors
              about "appropriate" ethnic behavior; (2) whether there exist inter-ethnic
              differences in resistance to "acting white"; and (3) how differences in social
              contacts or networks account for individual and group responses to "acting
              white." The study will employ both qualitative and quantitative data obtained
              from a mixed-gender, inter-ethnic sample of low-income African American and
              Latino adolescent respondents ages 13 to 18, all residents of
              government-subsidized housing. Data collection will include in-depth interviews
              and focus groups, with a subset of youth included in a larger longitudinal
              study: the Yonkers Family and Community Project (YF&CP) based at Columbia
              University. This research not only should attract the attention of many social
              scientists, but also social policy makers interested in racial and ethnic
              relations, gender, education, and social and economic mobility.
