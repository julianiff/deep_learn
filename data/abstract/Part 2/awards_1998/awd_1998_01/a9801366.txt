Abstract    :
              9801366  Paul  The richest species diversity and largest total biomass of all
              soil microbiota are realized by soil fungi. One subgroup, the basidiomycetes,
              produce enzymes involved in the degradation of lignin and humics and are
              responsible for the majority of the degradation of lignocellulose plant
              residues and soil organic matter. However, very little is known about their
              phylogenetic diversity and how this diversity affects ecosystem function. The
              recent availability of molecular techniques makes it possible to study soil
              basidiomycete diversity. The research will investigate species diversity of
              basidiomycetes inhabiting a range of treatments at the Kellogg Biological
              Station LTER site including tilled, non-tilled, fertilized, and unfertilized
              agronomic and nearby native sites. This will involve the isolation of soil
              basidiomycetes and PCR amplification of informative rDNA with subsequent
              phylogenetic analysis. These analyses will allow the investigators to identify
              the phylogenetic diversity of non-culturable basidiomycetes, as well as test
              several hypotheses regarding the effect of environmental variables on species
              diversity in this agronomically important group of soil-inhabiting fungi.
