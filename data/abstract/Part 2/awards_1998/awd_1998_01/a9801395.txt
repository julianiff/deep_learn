Abstract    :
                        9801395  Buhler    This award supports a five-day international
              conference on algorithmic number theory to be held at Reed College in June
              1998. This is the third conference in the Algorithmic Number Theory Symposia
              (ANTS) series. The ANTS conferences were organized to encourage not only the
              usual kind of number-crunching associated with number theory, but also some of
              the newer aspects, including algebraic number theory and geometry, applications
              to other fields such as cryptography, and theoretical investigations of
              computational complexity. Twenty years ago many of these ideas would have
              seemed very foreign to number theorists, but their increasing importance has
              led to a widely perceived need for a conference devoted entirely to algorithmic
              concerns, both practical and theoretical.       This conference falls into the
              general mathematical field of number theory.  Number theory has its historical
              roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those
              dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the
              oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely
              aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an
              indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing, cryptography, and  communication systems.
