Abstract    :
              Egoistic theories of collective action assume that such actions arise in the
              course of individuals pursuing their own interests. Communal organizations
              present a challenging puzzle for this view, as many of these organizations
              achieve very high levels of cooperation without formal incentives, such as
              wages or fines. This dissertation begins with the problem of solidarity in
              communes and provides a theory of informal social control, explaining group
              solidarity as a product of elementary social exchanges between members. It
              models aspects of organizational structure that condition and coordinate these
              exchanges, leading to compliance, malfeasance, or factionalism in simulated
              groups. On a macro-level, it will integrate dynamic models of organizational
              ecology with recent experimental work examining "exit options" in exchange
              relations. The marriage of these two frameworks will situate the micro-model of
              group processes in a macro-model of population ecology, as linked by choices of
              simulated agents to join and exit groups. To test the fit of these formal
              models, predicted outcomes will be compared against observed dissolutions of
              over 2,000 communal organizations, founded between 1609 and 1997. While the
              database includes records of over 1,200 communes, this project will expand and
              validate the existing database through visits to several historical archives
              and a survey of contemporary communes. In addition to testing a two-tiered
              theory of organizational solidarity, this project will provide an unprecedented
              record of structural trends and population dynamics for communal organizations
              over a span of nearly four centuries.
