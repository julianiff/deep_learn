Abstract    :
              9801022   Patton    The Major Histocompatibility Complex (Mhc) is a group of at
              least 84 genes which control part of the immune response.  The Mhc is shared
              among all vertebrates, with many alleles maintained in populations due to
              balancing selection.  Selection is thought to be due directly to exposure to
              disease organisms, since the Mhc functions in the immune system.      The
              potential for increased exposure to disease is assumed to be a major cost to
              the development of complex social systems in mammals, and this study is
              designed to test this assumption by examining the levels of Mhc variability in
              two related species of burrowing rodent (Ctenomys) that differ in their level
              of social interactions.  In one, individuals of both sexes maintain separate
              burrow systems and only contact one another briefly for mating; in the other,
              colonies of individuals co-inhabit a common underground tunnel system and share
              common nests.      The investigators will characterize the degree of genetic
              variation in two Mhc loci in study populations of both species near Bariloche,
              in southern Argentina, populations that are also being studied intensively for
              ecological, behavioral, and other attributes.  This study thus aims to test a
              major question in evolutionary biology (constraints on the evolution of
              sociality in mammals).  Simultaneously, the study has potential value to basic
              public health and disease studies in other mammals, such as humans.
