Abstract    :
                                                     EVANS  9801287     The physiology of
              individual plants is influenced by climate and weather  on multiple spatial and
              temporal scales. How widely distributed species  respond to variation in
              climate throughout their range and to temporal  variation over multiple time
              scales is not well understood. Lack of  knowledge on this subject prevents
              agriculturists from understanding how  crops respond to different growing
              conditions, resource managers from  making correct use and conservation
              decisions and researchers from learning  how ecosystems ultimately respond to
              climate change. The PIs research  focuses on assessing physiological changes
              associated with interannual  differences in weather, seasonal climatic shifts
              and spatial climatic  trends throughout the range of Fremont cottonwood. This
              species is the  primary component of forests which parallel valley rivers
              throughout the  arid western U.S. The PIs chose this species because of its
              importance as  the only tree species throughout much of the lowland western
              U.S. The PIs  are employing a variety of methods including direct measurement
              of  instantaneous physiological parameters such as water status and 
              photosynthesis as well as long term, integrated measurements such as carbon 
              isotope analysis. The PIs current data suggests a close correspondence  between
              climate and physiology for our study species.
