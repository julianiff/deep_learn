Under previous grants, the University of Colorado
              group has designed and constructed an active seismic isolation platform that
              uses a combination of active and passive seismic isolation to reduce the
              mechanical noise at a test-mass suspension's mounting point over a frequency
              range beginning at 1 Hz.  In each of the now-functioning cascaded stages,
              motion in each of the six degrees-of-freedom (DOF's) is sensed against an
              inertial reference (a seismometer) and reduced with a non-contacting forcer. 
              At 1 Hz, vertical and horizontal vibration transmission through the two stages
              is reduced by a factor of 3000 for large drives.  The group will complete work
              on and document performance of the two operating stages, with the goal of
              measuring a displacement noise in the first main stage of approximately
              3x10^(-13) m/(Hz)^(1/2).  Close collaboration will continue with the LIGO
              Science Collaboration (LSC) in studying the needs of advanced LIGO detector
              systems.

The Colorado active seismic isolation platform has been developed
              primarily to demonstrate techniques that can be used to reduce the mechanical
              noise at a test-mass suspension's mounting point over a frequency range
              beginning at 1 Hz, significantly lower than is currently planned for the first
              generation of interferometric gravitational wave observatories.  If such
              technology can be used in future LIGO detectors, low-frequency sources such as
              coalescing binary systems involving several hundred solar mass black holes
              might be observable.  Active isolation techniques are likely to also have a
              role in reducing the noise load on the systems used to hold the LIGO detector's
              optical elements in alignment and position.  As the LSC works to design a
              consistent set of improvements to implement in LIGO several years after its
              initial commissioning, the knowledge and experience gained in studying this
              active isolation demonstration system is expected to be useful.
