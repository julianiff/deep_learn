The principal investigator proposes to continue and
              expand in new 
directions an ongoing program of studying quantized spaces and
              dynamical 
systems on such spaces by means of the techniques of operator
              algebras and 
non-commutative differential geometry. The ultimate goals of the
              program 
are:
* To understand the mathematics of quantization of systems
              (involving 
both finitely and infinitely many degrees of freedom) with
              complicated 
dynamics;
* To study the non-commutative geometric principles
              underlying the physics 
of the microworld, and in particular possible
              implications for quantum 
chaos;
* To explore new mathematical phenomena
              relating operator theory to other 
fields of mathematics.
    
              
Non-commutative geometry is a new direction of mathematics created 
in the
              eighties. Its prime objective is to study objects, called
non-commutative
              spaces or manifolds, which are not ordinary geometric 
objects but still have
              a geometric flavor. Examples of structures
of this sort arise naturally e.g.
              in physical theories of subatomic 
phenomena. Methods of non-commutative
              geometry became a powerful tool 
in studying various problems in modern
              analysis and understanding the 
fundamentals of the physics of the microworld.
              It is proposed to
study examples of non-commutative manifolds and dynamical
              systems on them 
with emphasis put on applications to quantum physics and
              operator theory.
