Abstract    :
                  98-01082  Benfield/Simon    DDIG: Carbon dynamics in detritus-based systems:
              Can cave streams be used to understand energy flow in surface streams    Stream
              ecosystems rely on both aquatic plants and organic matter from terrestrial
              plants-leaves, wood-for energy.  The complex interaction between these two
              energy sources makes stream food webs difficult to study.  This project will
              use cave streams as surrogates for surface streams to better understand organic
              matter use in stream food webs.  Because cave streams rely exclusively on
              terrestrial organic matter for energy (there is no light in caves for
              green-plant photosynthesis) the roles of various organic matter types can be
              more easily examined. The PIs will determine the importance of particulate and
              dissolved organic matter in stream food webs by comparing energy processes in
              multiple cave streams with and without particulate organic matter input. 
              Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of leaf and wood input
              on particulate and dissolved organic matter availability, transport,
              transformation, and use in stream food webs.
