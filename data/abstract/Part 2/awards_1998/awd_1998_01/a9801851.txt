Abstract    :
              9801851       SRI International is in partnership with the Cognition and
              Technology Group at Vanderbilt University to develop student assessment tools
              that provide teachers and students with evidence about progress on the GLOBE
              program goals.  The student assessment tools serve three major purposes: 1)
              assess students' deep understanding of the GLOBE concepts and their ability to
              conduct and interpret GLOBE investigations, 2) provide information to GLOBE
              teachers for instructional decision-making, and 3) provide formative
              information to the evaluation of the GLOBE Program.  Three types of assessment
              tools for development are: 1) tests of the GLOBE protocols, 2) tasks requiring
              application and interpretation of measurements within the GLOBE investigation
              areas, and 3) integrated, on-line investigations emphasizing Earth systems
              interdependencies.  In addition, the project is creating assessment development
              guidelines and templates.  The GLOBE student assessment tools are to be part of
              the Teacher's Guide, the GLOBE Web site, and other GLOBE training resources.
