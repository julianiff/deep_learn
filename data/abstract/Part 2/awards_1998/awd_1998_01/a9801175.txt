Abstract    :
              9801175  Fenner and Wackford    This research focuses on the imported fire ant
              (Solenopsis invicta) that has become an invasive pest throughout the
              southeastern United States. Where it has invaded, the fire ant reduces
              diversity of other arthropods, and in particular it eliminates most other ant
              species. While a strong competitor within its native range in Brazil, the fire
              ant does not achieve the same level of total dominance there and in fact
              coexists with a diverse community of native ants. This research will examine
              mechanisms of competition and population regulation within an ant community in
              the native range of the fire ant, in Brazil.  Three mechanisms that could allow
              coexistence between the fire ant and other ants will be tested: 1) tradeoffs
              between dispersal ability and competitive ability, 2) mediation of competitive
              ability by species-specific parasitoids, and 3) seasonal spatial structure that
              leads to self-limitation.  This research will be one of the first to study the
              community interactions of an invasive ant species within its native range.
              Results of this work will be of immediate practical value in designing
              biological control programs directed at the fire ant in the southeastern U.S.
