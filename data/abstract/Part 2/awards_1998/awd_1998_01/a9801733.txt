Abstract    :
              Rex Skodje is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Progam to develop new methods to improve the understanding of  
              dynamical chemical processes.  Spectral quantization techniques will be  
              applied to transition state dynamics, control procedures will be   developed to
              optimize initial states, and applications will be made to   gas-phase
              photodissociation spectra and gas-surface scattering   resonances.  Methods for
              reducing complex systems of coupled nonlinear   kinetic equations to simpler
              lower dimensional models will also be   developed.  Applications will include
              combustion chemistry, vibrational   relaxation kinetics, and the kinetics of
              adlayers on solid surfaces.  Chemical reactions often proceed indirectly, i.e.,
              by first forming an   unstable intermediate and then on to final products. 
              These intermediate   species are often unstable and difficult to study
              experimentally.    Therefore it is necessary to employ quantum mechanical
              simulations to   characterize the dynamics of such systems.  Many important
              problems such   as atmospheric chemistry and combustion are modeled using
              nonlinear   kinetic equations.  New algorithms will allow the simplification of
                complicated networks of such equations.
