              Proposal: DMS-9801165  Principal Investigator: Manoussos Grillakis    Abstract:
              Grillakis proposes to study certain phenomena that are observed in the
              evolution of nonlinear waves. The basic object of study is a map from Euclidean
              space into a surface, for which two types of evolution will be investigated.
              The first is described by a wave equation, while the second is governed by a
              Schrodinger equation. The crux of the proposal is to study basic questions for
              such equations; namely, whether solutions exist globally or develop
              singularities, and how geometric properties of the target surface relate to
              analytic properties of the solutions.    The two equations that are proposed
              for study describe some extremely interesting physical phenomena. The wave
              equation, for instance, is a simplified model describing part of the evolution
              of two "black holes" in the setting of General Relativity. The Schrodinger
              equation models the evolution of magnetization on, say, a magnetic tape. In
              this context, the development of singularities serves as a possible explanation
              of how the tape becomes permanently magnetized.
