Abstract    :
              Rand  9801563    Previous work has shown that natural selection is important in
              determining the distribution of two different genetic variants of a key enzyme
              responsible for carbohydrate metabolism in the intertidal acorn barnacle,
              Semibalanus balanoides.  Barnacles with one enzyme variant of mannose phosphate
              isomerase (Mpi) exhibit higher survivorship in hotter, high-intertidal sites,
              while barnacles with the other Mpi variant have higher survivorship at more
              benign sites such as the low intertidal and under seaweeds.  The proposed
              experiments will examine the survivorship of barnacles with different enzyme
              variants under controlled conditions in a flowing sea water tank.  Temperature,
              desiccation, and the availability of mannose will be manipulated in a factorial
              design.  Barnacles that have settled onto rock slabs in the wild will be
              brought into the lab and allowed to grow under different combinations of
              conditions.  The proportions of Mpi enzyme variants before and after
              experimental treatments will provide explicit information about the action of
              natural selection on this enzyme that regulates a key step in the conversion of
              dietary mannose (from marine algae) into cellular energy.  The research will
              bear on the role of heterogeneous environments in the maintenance of genetic
              variation in natural populations.
