Abstract    :
                PI: Crompton  9801134    Limb reduction in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods)
              is a common  phenomenon. Some lineages reduce the total size of their limbs or
              lose them  altogether, while others simply reduce the total number of bones 
              (amphibians have only four fingers and birds have only three). Despite the 
              common occurrence of limb reduction in tetrapods, the evolutionary and 
              developmental mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. 
              This study will take an integrative approach to understanding the 
              morphological, molecular, and functional aspects of limb reduction through  the
              Australian lizard Hemiergis. Hemiergis is an ideal model organism for  limb
              reduction studies because it features a gradient of digit  configurations (from
              5 fingers and toes to 2 fingers and toes) within a  genus of several closely
              related species. This investigation endeavors to  compare patterns of skeletal
              development in different species of Hemiergis,  trace changes in the expression
              of limb patterning genes, and document the  functional changes that accompany
              limb reduction. Limb reduction typically  involves a common order of digit
              loss, and studies of Hemiergis development  will provide insight into cases of
              limb reduction in other tetrapod groups.  This project will also elucidate the
              evolutionary role of specific genes in  patterrdng the embryonic limb.
