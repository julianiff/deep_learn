The objective of this research is to develop optimum restraint
              systems for mobility impaired vehicle occupants who cannot sit erect and
              require alternative sitting postures, typically consisting of increased back
              recline.  The aims of the research are to modify an existing computer model to
              accommodate alternate sitting postures, to verify the model using a crash sled
              system available at the investigators institution, assess the standard
              restraint systems on these types of riders, and explore new restraint systems. 
              The results of this investigation could provide recommendations for other
              researchers, consumers, caregivers, manufacturers, and standards writers
              concerning the use of present seating positions and components, as well as
              recommendations for the use of customized wheelchair seat and back components,
              postural support straps, and head positioning devices.
