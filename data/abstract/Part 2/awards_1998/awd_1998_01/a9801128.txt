Abstract    :
              9801128  Raven/Schaal/Olsen    Moringa, the only genus of the horseradish tree
              family (Moringaceae), spans an unparalled range of form and geography, from
              massive, water-storing "bottle trees" in Madagascar and Namibia, to slender
              trees in Arabia and India, to tiny tuberous herbs in northeastern Africa.  The
              highest diversity of plant form is thought to occur in the dry tropics, but the
              mechanisms that have produced this diversity is little studied.      In this
              doctoral dissertation research, Peter Raven, Barbara Schaal and doctoral
              student Mark Olsen will examine the role of historical changes in the timing of
              developmental events ("heterochrony") in producing the array of shapes among
              species of Moringa.  The research will employ a novel combination of techniques
              to follow the development of wood and flowers, both in wild plants and in those
              maintained under carefully controlled conditions of cultivation.  The
              developmental studies will be interpreted in the context of an hypothesis of
              the historical ("phylogenetic") relationships of the different Moringa species
              that the researchers will infer from an analysis of morphological and molecular
              (gene sequence) characters.  The research should contribute to an understanding
              of how plants with recent common histories may diversify in form and function
              to thrive in different environmental conditions.    This award includes a
