Abstract    :
              ***  9801516  Wixom    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will develop electrocatalysts for use in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). 
              The development of less expensive and CO tolerant electrocatalysts is a key
              challenge for the commercialization of DMFCS.  This proposal utilizes
              multifunctional Pt-Ru-metal oxide/metal carbide (Pt-Ru-MOx/MCy) materials for
              the oxidation of methanol.  This design combines two previous strategies that
              have proven very successful in improving efficiency and CO tolerance.  Highly
              dispersed bifunctional sites will be produced on hi-h surface area metal
              carbide support materials.  The bifunctional sites and carbide support are
              inherently active and CO-tolerant.  Pt-Ru  particles will be dispersed onto the
              support materials.  Composition and microstructure of the support material and
              Pt-Ru domains will be characterized.  Electrocatalysts will be fabricated into
              electrodes and evaluated for methanol oxidation activity.  These
              electrocatalysts will be 3-5 times more active toward methanol oxidation than
              carbon supported catalysts.  Furthermore, the greater density of support
              materials will overcome the diffusion limitations encountered with carbon
              supported catalysts, thus combining the cost benefits of supported catalysts
              with the superior performance of unsupported catalysts leading to lower cost
              and higher power density fuel cells.    Efficient, low-cost, and
              poison-tolerant electrocatalysts will significantly advance the feasibility of
              using DMFCs in Next Generation Vehicles and portable power supply systems.  The
              DMFC offers several advantages over conventional fuel cells based on hydrogen
              in particular with respect to fuel energy density, delivery, and storage.
