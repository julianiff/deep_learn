Abstract    :
                        Niziol  9801211      This project will explore a conceptually very
              simple K-theoretical approach to the  theory of p-adic periods. For a scheme 
              over a local field of mixed characteristic  the theory of p-adic periods
              attempts to relate the p-adic   geometric etale cohomology with the de Rham
              cohomology. This relation is supposed to be attained by so called period
              morphisms and the key theorems in the field (comparison theorems) deal with
              constructing this morphisms and showing that they are isomorphisms. This
              project proposes to use K-theory to construct the p-adic period maps. This
              should give new proofs of the known comparison theorems as well as show that
              they are true in some cases which were not known before.       This project
              falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two
              of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This
              combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
              problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error
              correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
              disks) and compact disks.
