Abstract    :
              9801590  Mathews    Dr. John Mathews at Pennsylvania State University and Dr.
              David Meisel at the State University of New York at Geneseo will use the
              Arecibo Observatory to detect and study micrometeors entering Earth's
              atmosphere.  The micrometeorites will be detected with radar observations plus
              a simultaneous search for the visible/near-infrared signatures of the
              particles.  Particle orbits and velocities can be determined.  Some of the
              particles may be of interstellar origin.  The results are relevant to areas in
              both planetary and atmospheric sciences.
