Abstract    :
                  9801551    Antonovics and Pringle    Models on reproductive ecology of
              mutualisms have not been well developed or tested.  Considering sexual vs.
              asexual reproduction, it has been hypothesized that mutualistic species that
              live inside other species, for example arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that
              inhabit plant roots, should be asexual which would allow the perpetuation of
              well adapted genotypes.  Sexual reproduction, in contrast, would create novel
              genotypes that might be less adapted to a host.  Information on the
              reproductive biology of mutualists is necessary to test this notion.  I plan to
              describe the genetic system of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as a first step in
              evaluating the asexual-predominance hypothesis for mutualisms.  I also plan to
              test the benefits to plants of associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. 
              This is necessary since a non-mutual relationship between fungi and plants due
              to environmental conditions or differing interactions with specific plants
              would provide situations that are inappropriate for testing the hypothesis.
