Abstract    :
                9801866  Mooers    This U.S.-Australia workshop will focus on the transient 
              circulation (especially wind-driven) of the coastal ocean.  The workshop will
              be held at Flinders University in  Adelaide, Australia during the week of
              September 28, 1998.  A review will be made of the theoretical, observational,
              and  numerical simulation studies germane to the subject, and  especially to
              the oceanography and meteorology of the  southern coast of Australia.  The
              review will be followed by  development of a joint science plan that the
              American,  Australian and broad international research community can  use as
              the basis for future cooperation. The U.S.  participants, led by U.S. organizer
              Dr. Christopher Mooers  of the University of Miami, will include two senior 
              researchers and a strong contingent of younger researchers  including two
              graduate students and five post-doctoral  researchers. The Australian
              participants will be led by the  Australian organizer, Dr. John A. T. Bye,
              School of Earth  Sciences, The Flinders University.
