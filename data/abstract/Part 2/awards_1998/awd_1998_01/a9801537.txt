Abstract    :
                  9801537  Moran and Stireman    This research is concerned with the factors
              that determine the host range of parasitic insects.  Many parasites are highly
              specialized and generally incapable of moving between hosts.  In contrast,
              tachinid flies that act as parasites (Diptera; Tachinidae) tend to exhibit wide
              host ranges. There is relatively little understanding of what ecological
              factors determine the range of hosts utilized by a parasitoid.  The PIs
              hypothesize that tachinid host ranges are primarily determined by the search
              strategies used to find host species. Their research will take three
              approaches: 1) it will involve a comparison of host-related behaviors of two
              species that vary in host specificity, 2) examine the patterns of host use by a
              community of tachinid parasitoids in the field and 3) analyze the evolutionary
              patterns of host use in a subgroup of the family.  By integrating information
              from these three levels of inquiry, they will further our understanding of the
              development and ecological modification of parasitoid-host associations.
