Abstract    :
               This is a six month standard grant.  This four-day invitational workshop will
              bring together a   cross-functional community that will develop scenarios for
              supporting future virtual teams and   communities involved in collaborative
              research and diffusion.  This is a preliminary effort to improve   their
              capabilities to absorb and leverage new enabling knowledge and collaboration
              technologies.    Transforming these and other improvement communities into
              future high performing networked   improvement communities is the central focus
              of this workshop.  Participants represent a wide variety of   improvement
              communities from industry, government, and academia interested in collective
              improvement   on this frontier.  Results include guidelines for the
              action-oriented scenario design process, a final report   including an initial
              road map of co-developed scenarios, findings, and recommendations, and a primed
                community of improvement communities.
