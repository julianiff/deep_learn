Abstract    :
              Vleck  9801503        Maternal effects describe the non-genetic component of the
              interaction  between mother and offspring characteristics. Eggs are an ideal
              system in  which to study maternal effects because investments made prior to
              hatching  can be measured directly and correlated with subsequent offspring 
              performance. In a population of wild birds studied in 1997, the egg size  from
              which an individual hatched explained a significant amount of the  variation in
              mortality among genetically related individuals during the  first two weeks
              after hatch. The amount of yolk remaining at hatch and yolk  testosterone are
              two maternal effects which may provide a mechanistic  understanding of the
              differences in survival between large and small  offspring. In project one the
              investigator will manipulate the amount of  yolk remaining at hatch and explore
              the effects of these yolk reserves on  hatchling growth, development and
              survival. In project two the investigator  will characterize yolk testosterone
              in eggs and correlate this with chick  performance after hatch using a
              fostering protocol. This fostering design  allows for the distinction between
              pre-hatching and post-hatching maternal  effects. Both projects provides for a
              powerful analysis of variation in  maternal effects and the subsequent
              consequences to offspring performance.
