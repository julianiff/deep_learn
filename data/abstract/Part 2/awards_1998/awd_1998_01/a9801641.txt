Abstract    :
              9801641  Barbosa and Legrand    This research will determine how both direct and
              indirect effects of plant morphological complexity affect the efficiency of
              insect predation.  Plant morphology can directly act on the predator by
              influencing its movement or indirectly by influencing its prey.  The objective
              of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that plant morphological
              complexity will reduce the efficiency of predation by a beetle (Coccinella
              septempunctata), which is a predator of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum.  The
              investigators propose to test the effect of plant morphological complexity by
              utilizing morphological mutant forms of the garden pea. Specifically, three
              forms have been selected based on their degree of complexity in edges and
              branching.    The research has three objectives: 1) to determine the direct
              effects of plant morphological complexity on the aphid prey, 2) to determine
              the direct effects of plant complexity on the predatory search patterns, and 3)
              to determine the effects of plant morphological complexity when both predator
              and prey are present.  This work will be done by making detailed observations
              on speed of movement of the predator on the different plants, location of
              search effort, time needed to find the prey and likelihood of leaving the
              plant.  The results of this research will answer questions about the role of
              plant physical traits mediating tritrophic level interactions and the role of
              spatial structure heterogeneity in studies of predator-prey interactions.
