Abstract    :
                9801320  Terborgh and Asquith    This work focuses on the question of why
              tropical forests support an extraordinary level of species diversity and the
              factors that reduce diversity following disturbance.  The approach is to
              combine both monitoring and manipulations in forest fragments in Panama that
              have been isolated for over 85 years. These forest patches were created in 1912
              as a byproduct of the construction of the Panama Canal. Such forest fragments
              have been shown to have suffered forest tree species loss.  Comparison of
              species diversity in forest fragments with nearby intact forests will provide
              an indication of the extent of tree species loss during this period of time and
              manipulative experiments will provide evidence for mechanisms driving this loss
              of diversity. Specifically, rates of germination, seed predation, seedling
              herbivory and survivorship will be measured in forests with different mammal
              communities and other experiments will focus on effects of soil moisture on
              seedling survival.  These experiments will provide insights into the mechanisms
              that drive loss of biodiversity in disturbed tropical forests.
