This award supports research  in homological and
              commutative algebra.  Three related topics will be investigated: homological
              theory of local rings, representation theory of modules over local tings and
              Picard groups of algebraic varieties over field that are not algebraically
              closed.

Commutative algebra, among other things,  studies the solutions of
              polynomial or power series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a
              ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions.  The algebraic properties of
              these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic
              nature of the equations.  The field combines techniques from a number of other
              areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis.
