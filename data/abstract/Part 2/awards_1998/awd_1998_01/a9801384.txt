Abstract    :
              ***  9801384  Hu    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will provide a new solution to the problem of constructing the interior
              information of a three-dimensional object from its projection measurements
              acquired with a large area detector and cone-shaped x-ray beams.  This study is
              fundamental to the volumetric CT scanner development.  In Phase I, it has been
              demonstrated that a new approach, developed by the Principal Investigator using
              circle-and-line scan path for data collection and a "hybrid-type" of
              reconstruction algorithm for data processing, combines the strengths and
              eliminates the weakness of two most popular (widely-used) classes of
              approaches.  In the Phase II research, this new approach will be further
              refined and developed for final commercialization.  Its performance advantages
              in terms of improving information fidelity, operating speed, applicability,
              reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the volumetric CT scanner will be
              further demonstrated using x-ray data from potential customers -- CT
              manufacturers and other research groups.  A software package of this new
              approach will be developed for use with the general-purpose computers. 
              Commercial applications of this technology will be identified.    The
              successful development of this new approach will accelerate the
              commercialization and the acceptance of the volumetric CT scanner, which in
              turn, will generate fundamental impacts in manufacturing industries, medicine,
              security and safety inspection, as well as in material science and engineering.
               Successful applications in these areas can enhance national competitiveness
              and improve the well being of the public.  ***
