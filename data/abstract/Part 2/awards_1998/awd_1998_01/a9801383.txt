              Project a new approach to the growth of single crystals of silver gallium
              sulfide (AgGaS2 or AGS) - a unique material for nonlinear optical applications.
               An AGS optical parametric oscillator that can be pumped by a 1.06 um Nd:YAG
              laser can provide radiation continuously tunable from 2.5 to 10 um.  All
              present crystal growth methods for AGS use directional crystallization from a
              congruent melt, that produce as-grown crystals containing second phase
              inclusions that have to be annealed to improve their optical quality.  This
              technology produces material of variable composition, yield, and quality,
              involves high cost and yields crystals of limited size, all of which limit
              potential applications of AGS.  In our Phase I research and in a subsequent
              INRAD funded bridge program, we have established the feasibility of AGS crystal
              growth by Czochralski and Top Seeded Solution Growth (TSSG) Encapsulated by a
              Rotating Seal.  In Phase II we propose to further develop these two new crystal
              growth processes.  High quality AGS crystals of large size, high quality and
              lower cost will make possible efficient laser sources continuously tunable from
              2.5 to 10 um. Such sources will have numerous commercial applications in
              environmental monitoring for contaminants in air, spectroscopy research,
              Microelectronics manufacturing and high resolution infrared spectrometers.  ***
