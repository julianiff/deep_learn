Abstract    :
              Paternity and Mating Success in Elephant Seals    The aim of this study is to
              determine the relationship  between mating behavior of males and paternity in
              the most  highly polygamous animals in nature, the elephant seals,  Mirounga
              angustirostris and M. leonina.  Male seals that  aggressively dominate other
              males monopolize mating with  hundreds of females grouped in harems but the
              degree to  which mating success converts to paternity is unknown in  this and
              other highly polygamous species. Mating records of  individually marked seals
              at Ano Nuevo, California, and  Peninsula Valdes, Chubut, Argentina, will be
              obtained to  determine mating success.  Small tissue samples will be  collected
              from males, females and their pups, and paternity  will be determined using DNA
              analysis (microsatellite  variation).      Paternal analysis is a more accurate
              measure of male  reproductive success than mating success.  It is important  to
              measure individual reproductive success because it  estimates the degree to
              which one or a few individuals  determine the genetic composition of the next
              generation,  that is, the speed and direction of evolutionary change. 
              Estimates of differential reproductive success between the  sexes explain sex
              differences in morphology, behavior, and  life history strategies.
