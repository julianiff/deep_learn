Abstract    :
                DMS-9801608   Alexander R. Its    The  research project is focused on the
              analytical aspects of the theory of   integrable systems related to the
              Riemann-Hilbert and isomonodromy methods.   The problems under consideration
              include the asymptotic analysis of the   correlation functions of  exactly
              solvable quantum field and statistical   mechanics models, the investigation of
              the double scaling limits in the theory of random matrices and orthogonal
              polynomials, and the global asymptotic analysis of the solutions of integrable
              differential equations of the Painleve' and KdV types.    The theory of
              integrable systems is an expanding area which plays an   increasingly important
              role as one of the principal sources of new   analytical and algebraic ideas
              for many branches of modern mathematics and   theoretical physics.
              Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool   for the study of some
              of the fundamental mathematical models which play a   central role in numerous
              applications arising in modern nonlinear science   and technology.
              Specifically, the research directions indicated above   deal with the
              mathematical models which form the theoretical basis for   the following
              fields: condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics,   nonlinear
              hydrodynamics, and high bit-rate telecommunication systems.
