Abstract    :
                9801245  Mishler    Jamesonia is a mainly Andean genus of ferns that is unique
              among the ferns in its vegetative and ecological characteristics. This highly
              modified group of ferns exhibits a suite of morphological features perhaps
              related to the extreme environmental factors prevailing in Neotropical p ramo
              ecosystems.  The term p ramo generally refers to Andean highlands, between 3200
              and 5000 m altitude, located above the forest and below the permanent snow
              levels. The amazing diversity of the flora present in the p ramo and cloud
              forest ecosystems is the result of geologically complex events during the
              formation of the Andes. Jamesonia and its closest relative Eriosorus are a good
              example of two closely related taxa that evolved and diversified in a newly
              arisen habitat. The initial goal of this study is to clarify the phylogenetic
              relationships of Jamesonia and its closest relatives.  To answer this question
              two different phylogenetic levels will be studied: 1) a higher-level phylogeny
              of the subfamily Taenitidoideae (Pteridaceae), based on  morphological
              characters and DNA sequence data from the chloroplast gene rbcL, and 2) a
              lower-level phylogeny of Jamesonia and Eriosorus, based on morphological
              characters and sequence data of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) within
              the 18-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). The second goal of this study is to
              investigate the ecological conditions and biogeographic context of the
              evolution of this group.  A quantitative comparative approach using
              biogeographic and ecological data will be used to infer processes of
              diversification in the context of the above phylogenies.  Comparative studies
              on the heteroblastic series of Jamesonia and Eriosorus, within the phylogenetic
              framework, will be pursued to contribute in our understanding of the
              relationships between ontogenetic processes and morphological diversification.
