Abstract    :
              9801806  Brooks  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global 
              Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this
              project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists
              and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of
              better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within
              it.  This proposal will development new  protocols, and conduct scientific
              research with GLOBE data.  The project will develop a new protocol for the
              measurement  of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), and is based  on
              an inexpensive hand-held sun photometer, and/or sky-color  cards.  Measurements
              of AOT will introduce students to the  connections between air pollution,
              natural events such as  dust storms and forest fires, and variations in surface
               insolation.  More advanced students can use the data is  studies of Beer's law
              for radiative transfer.  These measurements will enhance data from extremely
              sparse  networks of ground-based AOT observations.  Reducing the  uncertainties
              in the global radiative transfer effects of  the aerosols s currently one of
              the highest scientific  priorities of the climate studies community.  Local and
              global environmental conditions are affected by  the presence of atmospheric
              haze layers.  Visibility is a  major parameter in environmental quality in its
              own right  and haze layers affect the surface radiative transfer  balance of
              Earth as well as influencing optical remote  sensing measurements which are a
              major source on information  for study of global environmental change. 
              Students will be  contributing  quantitative measurements to the study of haze 
              layers.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
