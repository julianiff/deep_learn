Abstract    :
                9801469  Chao    It has been predicted that evolution by natural selection
              should proceed by small steps because advantageous mutations of small effect
              should be more common than advantageous mutations of large effect.  The
              theoretical justification for this prediction is credited to Fisher, who
              theorized that mutations of large effect are more rare because they are more
              likely to have deleterious side  effects.     This study provides the first
              experimental test of Fisher's model by following the evolution of laboratory
              populations of an RNA virus that harbors a deleterious mutation.  Frozen
              samples from the populations will be saved at set time intervals, and evolution
              in the populations will be reconstructed by measuring the fitness (relative
              growth rate) of the frozen viruses.  Preliminary results show that the viruses
              recover from the deleterious mutation by evolving higher fitness through
              natural selection.  They also show the fitness increase can be by many
              mutations of small effect, as predicted by Fisher.  This study examines in more
              detail the properties of those small mutations.  In particular, the interaction
              between the original deleterious mutation and the small mutations is considered
              by examining whether the small mutations, in the absence of the original
              deleterious mutation, may be themselves deleterious.  The demonstration that
              the small mutations are deleterious when alone is an important result because
              it shows that two deleterious mutations can interact to become advantageous.
              Such interaction provides the initial step for the potential evolution of new
              viral species.
