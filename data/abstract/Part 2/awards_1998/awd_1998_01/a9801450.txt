Abstract    :
              9801450    Doebley    The phenomenal diversity of the grass tribe Andropogoneae,
              which contains such common plants as corn and prairie grass, will be examined
              in this study.  This group provides material to elucidate the molecular and
              genetic changes that has led to the evolution of variable forms.  There is good
              evidence that the  tribe originated about 60 million years ago, and since that
              time members have diverged so that genera display a dazzling array of both
              floral and vegetative characteristics.  The hypothesis that changes in the same
              gene underlie the evolution of related but diverse traits will be tested using
              the gene teosinte branched1.  In maize tb1 is involved in the control of stem
              branching and floral-gender aspects of plant and inflorescence architecture. 
              Utilizing in situ hybridization of selected organs of different genera, we will
              begin to determine if tb1 expression patterns correlate with the observed
              pattern of trait diversification across the tribe.  If such a correlation
              exists, we will have evidence that a single gene can potentially contribute to
              the evolution of a specific morphological feature.
