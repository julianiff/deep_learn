In many organisms occurring in nature, males and females often
              demonstrate fitness-related differences in mating.  A female may benefit by
              allowing only certain of the sperm she receives to fertilize her eggs, while a
              male benefits by encouraging the female to use as many of his sperm as
              possible, at the expense of other males.  When these interests conflict, an
              evolutionary struggle between males and females results.  This struggle can
              create perpetual change in internal reproductive anatomy and physiology, such
              that males and females that encounter one another often evolve reproductive
              systems that are finely tuned to one another, but are different from the
              reproductive systems of other closely related animals.  Such differences in
              internal reproductive systems may then prevent subsequent interbreeding between
              groups, contributing to the differences that lead to the origin of new
              species.

The investigators have discovered evidence of this process within
              the widely studied genus of fruit flies, Drosophila.  When sperm from two
              closely related species of Drosophila compete for the eggs of a single female,
              those sperm from a male of the same species as the female invariably
              out-compete the sperm from the more distantly related male. The proposed
              research will investigate 1) how widespread evidence of the described process
              is in the Drosophila genus, 2) how rapidly the described differences in
              internal reproductive systems can evolve, 3) the mechanism by which sperm gain
              a competitive advantage over sperm of other species, and 4) the mechanisms of
              competition among sperm from males of the same species.  This project will
              further our understanding of the importance of internal reproductive phenomena
              in the origin of differences among species.
