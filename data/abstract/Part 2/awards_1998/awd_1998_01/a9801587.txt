Abstract    :
              9801587  Peterson    Spatial scale has been considered carefully in the study of
              fragmented ecosystems, but the effects of temporal scale have been largely
              overlooked. Most fragmentation studies focus on anthropogenically fragmented
              situations that were largely fragmented on a time scale of 101 - 102 yr.  This
              is a time scale within which faunas are expected to still be in the dynamics of
              relaxation. Naturally fragmented systems, however, provide an opportunity to
              view older fragmentation schemes ( 103 - 104 yr), potentially allowing analysis
              of response patterns under equilibrium conditions. The Oaxaca Valley in
              southern Mexico represents a naturally fragmented ecosystem, ideal for the
              study of the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation. Twelve thousand years
              ago, humid pine-oak forest was the dominant vegetation type throughout the
              region.  This forest type is now restricted to high elevations. In the proposed
              study, the resident bird communities in these relict patches will be
              inventoried, distribution patterns described and avifaunal variation related to
              patch characteristics. Distributional data will be compiled using existing
              historic specimen data, and inventories completed by field inventories.
              Fragments will be described based on direct field measurement, consultation of
              thematic maps, and data from remotely sensed imagery. Robust new statistical
              techniques, which we have tested in anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems,
              will be applied to understanding influences of temporal scale on effects of
              fragmentation on avifaunas. Additional analyses will focus on functional groups
              of taxa, such as feeding guilds, phylogenetic lineages, etc., to provide more
              detailed understanding of processes involved. Results will be applied to
              designing a reserve system for maximal preservation of the bird diversity of
              the ecosystem.
