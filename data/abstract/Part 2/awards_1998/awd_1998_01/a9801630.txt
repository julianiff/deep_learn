Abstract    :
              HRD 98-01630    Williams    Dayton Public Schools is a midsize urban school
              district in Ohio which serves a student population that  is nearly 68% African
              American.  In spite of focused attention to science and mathematics achievement
               over the past six years, the district s African American students continue to
              underperform their peers  on state tests of science and mathematics
              proficiency.  In addition, they have low rates of participation  in advanced
              courses in science and mathematics and their failure rates are higher than
              those of other  district students.     In this application the district
              proposes a Science and Mathematics Systemic Reform Program which  will bring
              together the resources of diverse school and community partners to carry out an
              innovative  plan that will result in measurable improvements in the science and
              mathematics performance of  minority students, increasing their potential for
              successful participation in postsecondary study in  science, engineering, and
              mathematical fields.  In previous collaborative efforts with its local
              partners,  the school district has established a solid foundation from which to
              launch a comprehensive reform of  science and mathematics education. 
              Initiatives undertaken during the past six years have focused  primarily on: 
              revision of the K-12 science and mathematics education curriculum; inservice
              training to  improve teachers' content knowledge and teaching skills in science
              and mathematics; and the upgrading  of science laboratories and equipment.  In
              addition, substantial progress has been made in the  application of technology
              and the use of community resources in the reshaping of science and  mathematics
              education within district schools.    The proposed project addresses the
              remaining barriers that contribute to the continuing  disproportionality of
              student achievement and impeded the progress of all district students in 
              mathematics and science learning.  It will consist of multiple components,
              including:    o  comprehensive staff de velopment for all elementary faculty
              and all secondary science and     mathematics teachers    o  administrative
              leadership development to support the assessment, supervision, and
              instructional     delivery of science and mathematics education    o 
              implementation of a coaching system utilizing specially trained science and
              mathematics specialists     as on-site resource support for the achievement of
              teaching excellence    o  development of videotape models of exemplary science
              and mathematics instruction for use as     professional development tools    o 
              establishment of improved methods of evaluating student achievement in science
              and mathematics     and accessing this data more frequently for closer
              monitoring of educational outcomes    o  a restructuring of middle and high
              schools into collaborative learning communities which operate as     teams and
              promote the use of research as a base for improving science and mathematics
              teaching    o  the infusion of technology to enhance both the instruction and
              the instructional management of     science and mathematics education    o 
              enhanced student academic support and enrichment programs in science and
              mathematics and     efforts to increase parental involvement in science and
              mathematics learning support    o  systematic attention to policy issues that
              will promote equity and excellence in science and     mathematics for all
              students in the district.
