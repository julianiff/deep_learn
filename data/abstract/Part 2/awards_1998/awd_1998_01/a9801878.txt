Abstract    :
              ***  9801878  Gould  Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are important in 
              many areas of science and engineering.  These subjects have  evolved especially
              rapidly during the recent past and should  be central to the undergraduate
              physics curriculum.  This  activity will define a core set of concepts and
              skills for  thermal physics and develop new curricular materials to  update and
              strengthen undergraduate instruction in this  area.  These materials will
              encourage more active student  involvement than do traditional textbooks and
              lectures, and  will include hypertext linked to tables of experimental and 
              simulation data, computer tools for the analysis of data,  templates for the
              writing of short computer programs to  enable students to go beyond idealized
              algebraic  calculations, and self-contained modules on contemporary 
              applications.  The proposed contributions include a reinvigoration of 
              classical thermodynamics, an increased emphasis on the  conceptual
              understanding of probability, entropy, maximum  work, and free energy, and the
              application of basic ideas in  thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to
              contemporary  problems.  These materials will be disseminated to the  physics
              community via a World Wide Web site, which will also  serve as a platform for
              the co-principal investigators to  help the physics community to continually
              improve their  thermal and statistical physics courses and to encourage 
              students to use the self-contained application modules.  They will also edit a
              special issue of the American Journal  of Physics devoted to thermal physics,
              give an AAPT  workshop, and organize a symposium on teaching thermal  physics.
