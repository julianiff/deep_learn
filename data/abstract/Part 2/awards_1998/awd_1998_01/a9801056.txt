Abstract    :
              9801056 PATTON  Rats and mice of the subfamily Sigmodontinae comprise the
              largest group of living mammals in South America, with some 250 species
              occupying all habitats throughout the continent. One of the subgroups of this
              diverse assemblage is the Oryzomyini, a group ("tribe") of about 15 genera and
              100 species that occur from the grasslands of the high Andes to the Amazon
              rainforest.  Many of these have highly localized ranges and are of conservation
              concern; others are widespread and have been implicated as vectors in human
              diseases.  Little is certain about the historical (phylogenetic) relationships
              among rodents in this tribe; it is thought that they are descended from North
              American migrants.  Resolving these relationships is a complex problem that
              presents a significant scientific challenge.  A robust reconstruction would
              provide a historical framework for informed management decisions for those
              species of conservation concern (such as those endemic to the Galapagos
              Islands) as well as for those implicated as vectors in major human diseases
              (such as hanta virus).  In this doctoral dissertation research, James L. Patton
              and student Luis F. Garcia will reconstruct the phylogeny of the Oryzomyini,
              principally by comparing DNA sequences from several genes in the mitochondrion
              and nucleus. The "combined gene" approach should provide high resolution of the
              phylogeny at all taxonomic levels within the tribe.  The phylogeny should allow
              the researchers to test some prevailing ideas about when and where these
              rodents first became established in South America, and how they diversified
              after their introduction.
