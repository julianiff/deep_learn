Abstract    :
              This project will use the extensive archival data set from the AMPTE/CCE
              satellite to investigate the way in which the composition of the ring current
              (specifically, H+ and O+) affects the rate of ring current decay and hence the
              recovery from a magnetic storm.  The investigators will examine the various
              loss processes involved, such as charge exchange, coulomb collisions, and
              wave-particle interactions.  Storms vary in the total energy pumped into the
              ring current and the H+/O+ ratio also varies.  The differing cross-sections to
              the various loss mechanisms can therefore lead to very different magnetic
              storms.  An understanding of the details of these processes will likely lead to
              a better understanding of recovery process.  This can in turn lead to
              improvements in the models of the ring current and radiation belts that are
              expected to become part of the Global Geospace Circulation Model (GGCM).  This
              is therefore an important topic for the Geospace Environment Modeling program
              (GEM).  It also has significance to the Space Weather program.
