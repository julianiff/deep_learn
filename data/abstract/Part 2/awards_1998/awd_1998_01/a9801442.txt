Abstract    :
              9801442  Brundan    This award supports research on the study and computation of
              various branching rules for modular representations of general linear groups
              and symmetric groups.  In particular, the principal investigator is interested
              in determining to what extent such classical branching coefficients are equal
              to the analogous coefficients in the quantum versions of these problems.  He
              hopes both to extend existing techniques based on lowering operators, and to
              exploit newly understood connections between branching rules and decompositions
              of tensor products.  A parallel project is to generalize existing results on
              completely splittable representations for general linear groups to orthogonal
              and symplectic groups.    The research supported concerns the representation
              theory of various algebraic objects including general linear groups and
              symmetric groups.  Representation theory is an important method for determining
              the structure of these objects.  This work has implications for a number of
              areas of mathematics including ring theory, group theory, topology and the
              study of Lie algebras.
