Abstract    :
                        Bogomolov  9801591    The principal investigator intends to continue
              his work on the geometry of algebraic varieties, the structure of Galois
              groups, and related problems in birational geometry. He plans to work on
              constructing minimal dominant classes of algebraic varieties, asymptotic
              formulas for cohomology of line bundles, the description of fundamental groups
              and universal coverings of algebraic and symplectic manifolds, and the
              structure of complex symplectic and hyperkahler manifolds. He also proposes to
              work on the structure of Sylow subgroups of the Galois groups and on the
              effective version of the stabilization procedure for group cohomology.      
              This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic  geometry is
              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
              figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, 
              but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those
              fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
