Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Dinakar Ramakrishnan  Cal Tech  DMS 98-01328     In this project,
              Professor Dinakar Ramakrishnan will study three technical problems central to
              the Langlands program in Number Theory.  One problem involves the principle of
              functoriality involving the Asai L-functions and automorphic forms on the
              general linear group of degree 4.  The second involves a conjecture of the
              famous mathematician from the early part of the century, Ramanujan. The final
              project is to understand a class of cusp forms over complex multiplication
              fields with regular infinity type.      One of the most important mathematical
              ideas of the second half of the century, is that analytic formula  often
              encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count the number
              of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very
              hard to find. Mathematicians call these kind of problems 'discrete' because you
              are counting separated things. The functions that appear in calculus, and for
              which calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic' because they
              deal with all the real numbers no matter how close together.  Amazingly, the
              right kind of analytic function can contain the answer a discrete examples. 
              Actually the first examples of this were discovered a couple hundred years ago,
               but in the past thirty years, these examples have been systematized into a
              branch of number theory called the Langlands program.
