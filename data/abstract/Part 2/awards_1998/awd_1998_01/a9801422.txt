Abstract    :
                  9801521  Bertness and Rand    This research will examine how multiple
              ecological factors work together to structure a community of halophytic forbs
              known as the New England cobble beach community. This unique estuarine habitat
              is found along moderately protected coastlines from Long Island Sound to
              northern Maine.  It comprises a dense assemblage of forbs restricted to sites
              behind beds of the grass Spartina alterniflora.  One goal of the study is to
              elucidate the relative roles of seed supply and post-dispersal environment in
              setting patterns of plant distribution and abundance across marsh zones.
              Another goal is to examine the relative effects of post-dispersal factors,
              biotic interactions and physiological stress, on these patterns, with
              particular attention given to their potential interactions. Results from this
              study will provide an unusually complete understanding of this unique plant
              community and further our understanding of populations of sparsely distributed
              plants.
