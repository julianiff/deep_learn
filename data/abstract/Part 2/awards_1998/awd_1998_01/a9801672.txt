Abstract    :
              HRD-9801672  Eberhart    Teaching Easy Access to Math and Science (TEAMS) links
              a largely urban unitary school to broad-based  partnership of higher education,
              business and industry, and community organizations to boost achievement in
              college  preparatory science and mathematics.  TEAMS is a collaborative venture
              of the Montgomery Public Schools with  Alabama State University, the University
              of Alabama in Birmingham, Auburn University, BellSouth, TCI  Cable Television,
              and the Montgomery YMCA.    Project TEAMS directly addresses the system-wide
              commitment to raising student expectations, improving teacher  performance, and
              providing support for all students to succeed.  The project, a system-wide
              initiative, will involve  30,651 students in 31 elementary schools and 14
              secondary schools, with the exception of magnet and alternative  schools and
              special education centers.  MPS will implement Project TEAMS in order to
              reverse the current trend  of low enrollment in and successful completion of
              upper-level mathematics and science courses.  To accomplish this  goal, the
              following objectives will be met:    o        To double the number of students
              enrolling in and successfully completing, pre-college courses           which
              will prepare them to pursue undergraduate SMET programs  o        To double the
              enrollment of underrepresented minorities in advanced science and math courses 
              o        To double the number of graduates who successfully complete Algebra I
              by the end of the ninth           grade  o        To double the number of MPS
              graduates who successfully complete Physical Science by the end of the         
               ninth grade        o        To improve teacher performance through enhanced
              professional development programs  o        To increase parental involvement by
              25% through improved access to schools and faculty  o        To increase
              community involvement by 25% through linkages between schools and businesses
              and other           community organizations  o        To raise student
              performance in  math and science achievement to national and state levels as
              measured by           the Standard Achievement Test Series  o        To revise
              the math curriculum to meet local, state, and National Council of Teachers of
              Mathematics           Standards  o        To revise the science curriculum to
              meet local, state, and National Science Education Standards          
              (Benchmarks).    To accomplish these objectives, Project TEAMS will address
              achievement with a comprehensive systemic approach  which will:    o       
              Increase student interest in science and math through demonstrating real-world
              relevance  o        Enhance learning through partnerships, collaboration, and
              cooperation  o        Stimulate scholarship based on the acquisition of
              critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities of           all
              students  o        Offer assistance to students experiencing difficulty,
              especially in gatekeeping courses, by                        incorporating
              curriculum enhancement and support skills  o        Energize teachers through
              intensive staff development programs focusing on hands-on learning,          
              inquiry learning, interdisciplinary interaction, learning styles, and raising
              expectations of all           students  o        Enrich student learning
              through extended-day, Saturday, and summer enrichment activities  o       
              Offer parents assistance that will enable them to become more involved in their
              children's education  o        Link schools to community, business, and higher
              education through special enrichment programs and           opportunities.
