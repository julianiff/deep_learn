Abstract    :
              ***  9801059  Liszka    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop and test an innovative software tool which will merge the
              tasks of design and structural analysis into a single task.  The research will
              combine the technologies of topology optimization with emerging hp-adaptive
              meshless and finite element methods of structural analysis.  For a given
              package space and boundary conditions, this method will compute structures
              which are optimum in terms of topology as well as size and shape.  Error
              prediction features of the hp-adaptive method will hold the modeling errors
              within user prescribed bounds, thus significantly reducing design iterations,
              the most costly and time consuming portions of the design process.  Phase II
              will develop a three-dimensional (3D) prototype software package.  Phase I
              findings will be extended to 3D linear elasticity with error estimation to
              control solution quality.  The research will also explore improved convergence,
              stability, manufacturability, and overall performance of the computational
              algorithms.  This technology has a potential for dramatically reducing the
              iterative design process by concurrent running of design, analysis, and
              size/shape optimization algorithms in a single CAE step.  The anticipated ease
              of use will enable non-expert designers, as well as CAE experts, in applying
              this technology.  Particular use is expected in the automotive and aerospace
              industries, where one-half of all mechanical software applications are found
              and significant pressures to reduce product cycle times are experienced.  ***
