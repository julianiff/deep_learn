Abstract    :
              ***  9801062  Martin    This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop an innovative type of energy recovery system. If
              successful, it will significantly enlarge the opportunities for energy recovery
              in residential, commercial, and industrial ventilation applications. The
              proposed system will be used to recover otherwise wasted energy by transferring
              both heat and moisture between the fresh ventilation air stream entering a
              building and the outgoing exhaust ventilation air. While performing this
              function, it will suppress the transfer of pollutants which would otherwise
              accompany the transferred moisture and thereby undermine the quality of the
              ventilation air.  Present heat and moisture exchangers permit transfer of
              pollutants between the air streams, and are, therefore, unsuitable for
              air-quality-sensitive applications. The objective of the Phase II project is to
              design, fabricate, and operate a commercially-viable air-to-air
              heat-and-moisture exchanger with walls formed from the selective, low-cost
              membrane material developed in Phase I. The exchanger will transfer water vapor
              at a high rate while limiting the transfer of airborne gaseous pollutants.   
              This research will extend the use of energy recovery to settings where both
              pollutant control and energy conservation are priorities. The potential of this
              technology for the ventilation energy recovery market is estimated at $45
              million in the U.S.  ***
