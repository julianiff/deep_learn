Abstract    :
              9801070  Heller    This project involves the study of mechanisms describing
              wettable  surfaces of glasses that are composed of photoactive oxide 
              semiconductors.  Hypotheses describing the chemical origin of the  non-fogging
              properties of titanium dioxide coated glass surfaces,  such as by light induced
              creation of a photoelectret within a  semiconductor layer, will be investigated
              and experimentally  verified.  %%%  The resolution of the fundamental
              mechanisms for the creation  of non-fogging and self-cleaning surfaces and
              coatings could  have a very significant economic impact in that it will result 
              in new approaches to the design and engineering of advanced new  materials for
              a broad range of consumer, automotive, and  construction products.  ***
