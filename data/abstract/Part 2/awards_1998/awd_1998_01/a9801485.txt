This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal
              is directed at the development of high-resolution, low-cost, low-weight,
              low-energy-consuming, stable sensors w;th parts per billion (ppb)
resolution
              for environmental monitoring of ozone.  Calibration curves show that the 
              device will operate in a linear mode over the required range, and that 
              concentration changes of less than 5 ppb 03 can be measured reliably. 
              Short-term stability, temperature and humidity influences, the ozone 
              concentration sensitivity as well as interfering gas signals were investigated
              in Phase I with encouraging results. In Phase ll, sensor     and monitor
              prototype development to control producibility, sensitivity life, and sensor
              integration to multi-parameter devices will be expanded with a commercially
              viable miniaturized device that can be      produced with a Phase lll partner, 
              targeted.  Initially targeted environmental monitoring and industrial safety
              markets are expected to be in the multi-million dollar range.  Significant
              interest in ozone monitoring in offices and homes could generate markets far
              exceeding the volume of the initial markets. Cost-benefit estimations strongly
              support the proposed ozone sensor development. In addition sensor
              miniaturization will open up new product applications.
