Abstract    :
                The study of growth patterns is important in the study of human evolution. 
              Detailed comparisons of archaic and modern juvenile craniofacial morphology and
              growth patterns are possible because the remains of juvenile Neandertals are
              relatively abundant.  This project will compare modern and archaic juvenile
              craniofacial morphology and growth using eight juvenile Neandertals and ten
              samples of modern humans from Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. The
              purpose is to: 1) examine variability in modern h uman juvenile morphology and
              growth,  2) determine if a basic, modern human pattern of craniofacial growth
              can be distinguished, and  3) compare this modern human pattern with the
              Neandertal pattern.  This project is unique in using three-dimensional (3D)
              morphometric methods to examine craniofacial growth in Neandertals and is the
              first to include an adequate sampling of juvenile modern humans against which
              the Neandertal pattern can be evaluated.  The data consist of 3D coordinate
              locations collected from 80 landmarks on the face, neurocranium, basicranium,
              and mandible. A pilot study has demonstrated the utility of the 3D data and
              methods, and has revealed differences in growth between Neandertals and modern
              humans.  It also revealed differences in growth between two modern human
              samples, supporting the need for further investigation of variability in modern
              human juvenile morphology and growth.
