Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of catalytic enzymatic reactions   with
              readily accessible starting materials to afford enantiopure building   blocks
              that can be converted, by means of catalytic transition metal   reactions, into
              complex molecules having interesting biological   properties.  The methodology
              will be used to synthesize sugar analogs,   amino acids, glycoproteins and
              zaragozic acids.  With this renewal award,   the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the   research of Dr. Carl R. Johnson of the
              Department of Chemistry at Wayne   State University.  Professor Johnson  will
              focus his work on developing   new applications of enzymes as catalysts in key
              steps of the synthesis of   complex organic molecules.  The project will
              provide training of the   participants including undergraduates, graduate
              students and postdoctoral   associates in a wide range of very contemporary
              procedures and methods   and, in doing so, will provide highly qualified
              persons for economically   important chemical industries, especially the
              pharmaceutical and   agricultural chemistry industries.
