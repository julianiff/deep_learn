Abstract    :
              9801370  Lipscomb     The Zoantharia (which includes the Actiniaria  sea
              anemones ,  Scleractinia  stony corals , and Corallimorpharia  coral-like
              polyps  lacking a stony skeleton ) is characterized by the presence of an 
              eight-rayed, bilaterally symmetric larval form, called the edwardsia  larva. 
              In most actiniarians, this larva is a transient stage that   develops into an
              adult with twelve mesenteries and a distinctive basal  disc.  One family, the
              Edwardsiidae, gives its name to the larval stage  because its adults retain
              eight mesenteries and lack a basal disc.  The  similarity between the larval
              form of other zoantharians and adult  edwardsiids has given rise to various
              hypotheses including the hypothesis  that the Edwardsiidae are the basal group
              or the derived crown group of  the Zoantharia.  The goals of this research are:
               (1) to evaluate  hypotheses concerning the evolutionary placement of the
              Edwardsiidae in  the Zoantharia using phylogenetic methods.  Data for this will
              come from  gross anatomical and histological investigation of adults, studies
              of  developmental morphogenesis, scanning electron microscopy of nematocysts, 
              and transmission electron microscopy of sperm. (2) Because the  Edwardsiidae
              are apparently disappearing from many habitats, it is  important for us to
              develop accurate species and generic characterizations  and identification
              guides.  Therefore we will initiate of a revision of  the species and genera of
              Edwardsiidae that will include an analysis of  morphological variation within
              species collected from the same area, lists  of synonomy, distribution
              information, and indentification keys. The  Dissertation Improvement Award will
              allow us to travel to collect  specimens and to examine specimens in museum
              collections in Europe.
