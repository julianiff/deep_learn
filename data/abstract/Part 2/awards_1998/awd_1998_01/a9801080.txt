Abstract    :
                ***  9801080  Bloomfield,     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will produce a low cost proton exchange membrane fuel cell as a
              pollution free electric power source.  The  Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel
              cell is an efficient, pollution free power source.  The relatively high cost
              and weight of fuel cells have limited use in transportation applications. 
              Analytic Power will lower the cost and weight of PEM fuel cells by using a
              composite plate structure that is inserted in the injection mold.  Three
              candidate bipolar plate designs that emerged from the Phase I project will be
              tested for longevity and optimum performance.  To demonstrate the range of
              fuels that the PEM fuel cell may use for transportation applications, Analytic
              Power  will conduct operational tests on fuel processors.  The fuel cell  will
              be tested on pure hydrogen, reformed diesel fuel, natural gas, propane and
              ammonia.      Commercial applications of the research include clean power for
              vehicles and affordable residential power generation, both of which would
              directly benefit the NGV program.  Transportation applications include
              automobiles, bicycles, mopeds, and industrial electric trucks.    ***
