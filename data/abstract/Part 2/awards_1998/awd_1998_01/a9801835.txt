Abstract    :
              9801835  Jewitt      Dr. David Jewitt will carry out submillimeter wavelength
              and optical observations of outer Solar System objects to produce a unique data
              set leading to relatively model-independent estimates of the albedos and
              diameters of the objects.  Dr. Jewitt will use a bolometer array on the James
              Clerk Maxwell telescope on Mauna Kea to obtain imaging radiometry of Kuiper
              Belt Objects, Centaurs, Trojans of Jupiter, Jupiter satellites, and comets.  He
              will also obtain simultaneous visible wavelength observations using the
              University of Hawaii 88-inch telescope. The comets will be observed to
              constrain thermal emission from the nucleus, to measure the coma dust mass, and
              to measure the spatial and spectral properties of emission.    ***
