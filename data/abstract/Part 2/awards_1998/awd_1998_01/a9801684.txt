Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a robotic system that will extend a
              human's ability to perform small-scale (sub-millimeter) manipulation tasks
              requiring human judgement, sensory integration and hand-eye coordination.  A
              novel approach, called "steady hand" micro- manipulation is for tools to be
              held simultaneously both by the operator's hand and a specially designed robot
              arm. The robot cs controller senses forces exerted by the operator on the tool
              and by the tool on the environment, and uses this information in various
              control modes to provide smooth, tremor-free precise positional control and
              force scaling. The result will be a manipulation system with the precision and
              sensitivity of a machine, but with the manipulative transparency and immediacy
              of hand-held tools for tasks characterized by compliant or semi-rigid contacts
              with the environment.  Some specific goals of the research include: 1) a novel
              robotic system specifically designed for cooperative steady hand
              micro-manipulation research; 2) Control theory for stable cooperative force and
              position control; 3) Information-enhanced cooperative steady- hand
              manipulation: 4) Experimental validation in realistic micro-manipulation task
              environments.
