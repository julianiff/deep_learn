Abstract    :
              Robert Johnson  University of Virginia    Dr. Robert Johnson, University of
              Virginia, will continue a study of the effects of ion bombardment and
              ultraviolet radiation on low temperature solid surfaces.  Sputtering of ices is
              a process that has proved to be important in determining the reflectance of the
              icy satellites of planets in the Solar System.  There now exist a large body of
              laboratory data on the sputtering of ices.  This data set has some
              inconsistencies and large gaps in the materials, incident particles, and
              particle energies studied.  Dr. Johnson will calculate complete data sets for
              those ices that are critical to the understanding of the surfaces of outer
              Solar System objects.  He will also calculate how these data can be applied to
              icy satellite regoliths that have grain sizes and porosities much different
              from those in laboratory studies.  The data will be used on the production of
              molecular oxygen and hydrogen to quantitatively test the various solid-state
              chemistry models that have been proposed for the production and desorption of
              new volatiles during irradiation of ice.
