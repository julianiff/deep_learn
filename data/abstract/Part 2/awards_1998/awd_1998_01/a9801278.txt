Abstract    :
              9801278  Retakh    This awards supports the 22nd conference of the University of
              Arkansas Annual Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences.  This meeting will
              bring together leading experts in the fields of combinatorial methods in
              algebra.  It will provide a forum for an exchange of ideas as well as an
              opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to interact with
              prominent researchers in their areas.    This conference is concerned with the
              use of combinatorial methods in algebra.  Such methods are being widely used in
              a broad range of areas in algebra including ring theory, Lie algebras, and
              algebraic geometry.  This conference will bring together individuals with
              different perspectives and will encourage interaction among them.
