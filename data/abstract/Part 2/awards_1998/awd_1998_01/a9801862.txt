Abstract    :
              9801862  XIAO    This award will support five senior and five junior American 
              scientists in condensed matter physics to visit Vietnam for  two weeks for the
              purposes of  1) participating in a joint  workshop on high temperature
              superconductivity, and 2)  lecturing and visiting Vietnamese scientific
              facilities.  The American organizer, Professor G. Xiao of  Brown  University,
              has selected a team of well-known senior  American researchers. The Vietnamese
              organizer, Dr. Nguyen  Van Hieu, is President of the National Center for
              Science  and Technology and Director of the Institute of Materials  Science. 
              Through the interactions, which occur during this  activity, the American
              scientists will gain an understanding  of condensed matter physics in Vietnam
              and will form  relationships that eventually may lead to collaborative 
              research partnerships.
