Abstract    :
              Musson, 98-01151    Abstract      This proposal will deal specifically with
              several problems concerning  primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of a
              classical simple Lie  superalgebra.  The methods to be used include those
              developed by the PI  and results from representation theory.  In addition
              geometric methods   will be used to study the center of the enveloping algebra,
              and the  associated variety of a primitive ideal.  Differential operators on 
              invariant rings of tori are studied in a forthcoming joint memoir with  Michel
              van den Bergh, and we hope to extend some of this work to actions  of other
              reductive groups.  The PI also plans to study Hopf algebra duality  and cliques
              in quantum function algebras. He also plans to study  nonstandard quantum
              groups such as the Cremmer-Gervais examples.      There is motivation from
              Physics for this line of research since differential   operators which are
              invariant under various groups of symmetries are   important in quantum
              mechanics.  Finally, quantum groups have become  extremely important in recent
              years in both Mathematics and Physics.  Numerous connections have been found
              with such diverse areas as group  theory, low dimensional topology,
              combinatorics, number theory, conformal  field theory and statistical
              mechanics.
