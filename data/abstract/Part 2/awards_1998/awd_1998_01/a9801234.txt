Abstract    :
                  Abstract  Machedon    It is proposed to study two kinds of questions. The
              first one is the  Question of optimal regularity and blow-up of non-linear wave
              equations, continuing previous work with S. Klainerman. Fourier analysis
              methods applied to  special bilinear quantities are of cental importance in
              this work.  The second one is the question of asymptotic behaviour of the trace
              of  the Szego kernel, and how this local quantity relates to the global
              geometry of the boundary. It is motivated by the example of a disc bundle over
              a  Riemann surface.  It is joint work with J. Millson.      The first problem
              is motivated by some equations of Mathematical Physics, such as the famous and
              very difficult Einstein Field equation.  Simplified models are studied, hoping
              to understand the mathematical theory of questions such as: What mathematical
              features of a nice solution determine for how long that solution stays nice,
              before a singularity (such as a black hole)  forms? The second question relates
              local quantities (such as curvature) to global quantities (such as shape).
