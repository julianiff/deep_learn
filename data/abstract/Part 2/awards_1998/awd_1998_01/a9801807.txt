Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to study loss processes for radiation belt and ring current
              particles.  The theoretical study will investigate two processes, pitch angle
              scattering by ion cyclotron waves and non-adiabatic particle motion.  The
              theoretical predictions will be compared with data from particle spectormeters
              on several satellites.
