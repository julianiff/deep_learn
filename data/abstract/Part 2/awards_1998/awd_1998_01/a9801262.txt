Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Gopal Prasad  Michigan  98 01262     Gopal Prasad  will continue his
              work on the classification of admissible representations of reductive p-adic
              groups in terms of their restrictions to compact-open subgroups. He hopes to be
              able to refine the theory of ("unrefined")minimal K-types developed by him and
              A. Moy, and also find a suitable extension of the Kirillov theory for this
              purpose.  In another direction, he proposes to find a proof of the centrality
              of the congruence subgroup kernel for simply connected anisotropic groups of
              type A-n and determine the normal subgroups of the group of rational points of
              these groups.    A reductive p-adic group is the special collection of
              symmetries of an arithmetic or geometric object. This study is expected to
              unravel intricate and fundamental properties of the objects and patterns which
              are of interest in arithmetic and geometry through the study of these
              symmetries. One way to understand a group of symmetries is through a
              representation of its elements as matrices. Representation theory does this in
              a systematic way. Ultimately the goal is to be able to construct and classify
              all representations of the reductive p-adic groups, and from this settle
              important questions about the underlying geometric object. This is important
              because so many interesting arithmetic and geometric objects have interesting
              symmetries that form a reductive p-adic group.
