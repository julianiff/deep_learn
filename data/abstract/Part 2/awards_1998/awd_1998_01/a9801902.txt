Abstract    :
              9801902  Barstow     This is a four year project that is developing part of the
              learning activities related to the interagency GLOBE program.  Four Earth
              systems science modules are being developed for middle school and high school
              students.  The modules contain inquiry-based learning activities where students
              learn about interconnections among the components and processes of Earth
              systems.  Students observe their local study sites, explore GLOBE data and
              visualizations, and communicate with other schools throughout the world, all
              with a focus on investigating Earth as a dynamic set of connected systems. 
              Students learn key concepts of Earth system science, work with underlying
              science themes such as systems, models, evidence and data analysis, and gain a
              broader context for understanding each of the GLOBE protocols and their
              contribution to planetary science research.  Other  planned activities are
              creating modeling activities with a teachers guide, developing an interactive
              CD-ROM to help students visualize key concepts in Earth systems science, and
              developing Teacher training materials.
