Abstract    :
              ***  9801034  Graf  The Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from
              EDVOTEK, Inc. builds on studies completed in Phase I for the development of
              classroom plant-based science experiments, software and resources.  These plant
              science resources will be designed for integration in high school and college
              science courses; computer-based tools will complement these resources.  A major
              objective is to develop 'hands-on' and 'minds-on' experiments that build upon
              students' prior knowledge.  The project will entail qualifying Arabidopsis
              strains for establishing an educational seed center.  It will also involve
              selecting for development experiments that are currently presented in textbooks
              but not in manuals, as well as plant science biotechnology experiments. 
              Research and development for computer software (GenScope) and CD-ROM plant
              images will also be continued.  Two faculty workshops will be organized and
              conducted to field test and evaluate prototype experiments and software. 
              Participating faculty will be provided with take-home materials to incorporate
              in their classrooms, and they will provide the appropriate feedback. 
              Evaluation and assessment of prototype products will be initiated at the
              workshop using assessment tools that will be developed for determining teaching
              and learning objectives.  Information obtained will be incorporated in product
              development and final product for commercialization.  This project proffers new
              plant science laboratory activities which are an essential part of biology
              education, and it also fills the need for a biotech education seed center. 
              Knowledge of plants is not only essential to food production but also to the
              development new products that are useful in ecology, energy, and medicine.  ***
