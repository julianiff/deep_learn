Abstract    :
              9801194  Weiss    In 1974, Jacques Tits Classified buildings of spherical type
              which are of rank at least three.  Generalized polygons are spherical buildings
              of rank two.  The generalized polygons which are spherical buildings of
              classical and algebraic simple groups of Lie rank two all satisfy the Moufang
              property.  Tits and the principal investigator have recently classified Moufang
              polygons.  The principal investigator will investigate various questions which
              arise out of this work.  The most important of these concern the existence and
              structure of the exceptional quadrangles.    The research in this project
              involves the interplay between finite geometry and the actions of groups of
              transformations on these geometries.  This work has implications for the
              structure of finite groups, for algebraic coding theory, and for finite
              geometry.
