This workshop, to be organized by the American Rock
              Mechanics Association (ARMA), addresses the marked decrease in participation
              from industry and federal agencies in the field of rock mechanics research.  In
              conjunction with a symposium on Rock Mechanics under organization, ARMA will
              conduct a workshop on challenges and opportunities for partnerships in rock
              mechanics research.  For this workshop, CEO's and other executives from
              corporations and firms in the private practice of rock mechanics,
              representatives of various federal agencies, and educational leaders will be
              invited for participation.   

A panel of 10 speakers will be invited to
              cover a wide range of interests for the civil, mining and petroleum industries.
               The aim is to develop consensus on the future course of education and research
              in rock engineering and rock mechanics, and to draft a plan with strong and
              realistic recommendations.  The meeting will be held on June 6, 1999,
              immediately before the convening of the Rock Mechanics Symposium at Vail,
              Colorado.
