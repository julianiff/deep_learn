This proposal will develop a series of training institutes
              for teams of informal science institute (ISI) educators, teachers, and school
              administrators which will prepare them to implement professional development
              programs for middle school teachers (grades 6-8) in their local regions.  One
              goal of this five-year program is to create 50 ISI-school partnerships around
              the nation.  The 50 teams (of 3 individuals each) will receive 70 hours of
              professional development in one year, followed by 31 hours of technical support
              the next year.  Each institute will provide instruction in the National Science
              Education Standards, inquiry-based learning, authentic assessments, key life
              science concepts, and the integration of ISI exhibits and collections into
              school life sciences curricula.  The trained Science Advisory teams will then
              perform their own training workshops, ultimately training over 2,500 teachers. 
              Other ISI's have agreed to participate, including the Brookfield Zoo (Chicago),
              the San Diego Zoo, and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (Pittsburgh).
