Abstract    :
              The PIs will study the enechelon cracks along the outer shelf of Virginia and
              North Carolina in detail during a two-week geological/geophysical survey cruise
              with a deep-towed high-resolution vertical-incidence sonar system. Accurate
              mapping of these features and their subsurface geometry will help evaluate the
              hypothesis that the crack system indicates nascent slope failure along the
              shelf edge. This data, as well as data released by NOAA on gridded bathymetry,
              will provide evidence of past catastrophic failure and will lead to a better
              understanding of the role of these cracks in mass wasting and subsequent canyon
              evolution.
