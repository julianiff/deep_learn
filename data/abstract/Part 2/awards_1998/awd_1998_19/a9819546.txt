Abstract    :
              The National Alliance of Black School Educators (NABSE) proposes to conduct a
              six-month planing project to design a comprehensive, five-year program -
              Closing the Achievement Gap in Math, Science, Engineering, and Technology.  The
              goal is to develop and promote the implementation of educational strategies
              that can reduce the disparity in achievement between White and minority
              students in Grade K-8.  The planning project will result in three major
              outcomes:  3) the development of a detailed plan for conducting a national
              demonstration project; 2) the formation of an Advisory Board of expert resource
              persons committed to assisting NABSE in implementing the program from 1998
              through 2003; and 3) the development of a plan for establishing the NABSE
              Information Center on the Academic Achievement of African American Youth.
