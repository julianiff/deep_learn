The main purpose of the Instrumentation Workshop is to discuss
              scientific community needs for instrumentation at the new Spallation Neutron
              Source (SNS) that is under construction at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
              (ORNL).  Topics to be covered include:  Update on the current status and
              expected performance of the Spallation Neutron Source; priorities for the
              initial suite of ten instruments to be built at the high-power target station
              as part of the SNS reference design; and the science case for a second
              target/instrument suite optimized for long wavelength neutrons.  A secondary
              purpose is to hold the first meeting of Oak Ridge Neutron Users.  This will
              include current and potential users of both the SNS and the High Flux Isotope
              Reactor (HFIR).  Topics to be covered include:  Approval of By-Laws for the
              Users Group; discussion of user policies and concerns for SNS and HFIR; and
              presentations describing upgrades to the neutron scattering facilities at HFIR
              currently underway.  This part is being supported by ORNL.  Anyone with an
              interest in the use of neutron scattering to study the structure and dynamics
              of materials will be encouraged to attend.  Funds will be made available to
              help defray the costs of attending the workshop for some participants who could
              not otherwise attend.

This is an important workshop for the future of
              materials research.  It is timely because construction of the Spallation
              Neutron Source has now been authorized and funds appropriated in the FY 1999
              budget of DOE.  The NSF scientific community is expected to be among the many
              users of this facility when it is completed.
