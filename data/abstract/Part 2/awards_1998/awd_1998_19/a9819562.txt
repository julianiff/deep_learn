The communities of southwest Virginia and Radford University
              propose to implement a Local Systemic Change project in the Cumberland Plateau
              Regional Planning District of the Appalachian region of Virginia.  In 5 years,
              all 644 grade K-8 teachers in 39 schools will reconstruct their didactic
              textbook driven elementary science curricula and replace it with units selected
              from FOSS, Insights and STC instructional materials.  A resource center will be
              established and shared by all four school divisions in which the schools are
              situated  (Buchanan, Dickenson, Russell and Tazewell).  Southwest Virginia
              Community College will provide the facility.  All teachers will receive a
              minimum of 105 hours professional development.
