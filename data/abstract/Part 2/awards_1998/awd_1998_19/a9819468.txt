"Broaden Educational Access to Mathematics in Maine (BEAMM)"
              is a five-year Local Systemic Change (LSC) project in the area of Teacher
              Enhancement.  It involves seven Maine school districts, the Maine Mathematics
              and Science Alliance, the Maine Department of Education, Colby College, and the
              University of Maine System.  The BEAMM project will provide 525 teachers in low
              performing rural and urban districts with multiple professional development
              opportunities.  This K-8 initiative will support the implementation of
              exemplary mathematics curricula, provide extensive opportunities for reflective
              teaching activities, and use an electronic web-based forum for professional
              development.  The project will monitor the effectiveness of web-based
              professional development.
