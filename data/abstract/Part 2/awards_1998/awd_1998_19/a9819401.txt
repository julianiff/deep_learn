"Project Inquiry" is a teacher enhancement proposal for Bronx
              Community School District 9 to implement a systemic science and technology
              education program for all 810 K-6 teachers in 27 elementary schools.  Each
              teacher will receive a minimum of 118 hours of instruction over the five years.
               A facilitator-teacher in each school receives over 270 hours of inquiry-based
              science and methodology, technology, applications and leadership skills, in
              order to provide continuing school-site professional development.  The training
              is conducted by a consortium of New York City agencies, including NetTech,
              Lehman College, CCNY, and informal sites such as the Bronx Zoo.  Over 40
              hours/year of training are in the use of NSF-supported materials (Insights and
              STC).  Up to 4 district staff members and the 27 facilitators will provide
              continued training, technical assistance, coordination, science kit
              distribution, and refurbishment.  In addition, parents at each school will be
              involved in science inquiry activities with the informal science partners.  A
              dedicated space in CES 4 houses the District Science Center where workshops and
              resources are located.  The project is an outgrowth of the district's
              involvement with the NYC and Bronx Urban Systemic Initiatives.
