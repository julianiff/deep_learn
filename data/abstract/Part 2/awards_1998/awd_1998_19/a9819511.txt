Abstract    :
              Sprintall/Hautala

Funds are provided to conduct an extensive analysis of
              observations of the 
Indonesian throughflow  in conjunction with a simple,
              reduced gravity numerical 
model to elucidate the dynamics acting on seasonal
              to annual time scales. The 
observational data set consist a network of
              shallow pressure gauges, underway 
ADCP and CTD surface measurements, a
              current meter mooring, hydrographic 
and XBT sections, wind data and sea
              surface altimetry. The main scientific 
question that will be addressed are:
              (1) what are the mean and variability of the 
throughflow; (2) what are the
              processes that cause variability on annual, semi-
annual, and intraseasonal
              time scales; (3) what is the impact of this variability on 
heat and salt
              transports; (4) how does the South Java Current alter the water 
mass
              structure in the basin, and (5) what are the changes associated with the
              
1997-1998 El Nino event.
