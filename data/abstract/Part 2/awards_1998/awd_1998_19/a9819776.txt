Abstract    :
              The investigators will extract solar wind information and locate potential
              Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) sites at the sun from sequences of low spatial
              resolution synoptic maps derived from magnetograms. Their approach is to use
              the publicly available GONG (Global Oscillation Network Group) data archive to
              upgrade the time resolution and coverage of an established technique. GONG is a
              community-based project primarily intended to conduct a detailed study of solar
              internal structure and dynamics using helioseismology. The GONG
              distributed-site data will allow frequent (20 minute) sampling of the solar
              magnetic field with reduced influence from local troposphere (as opposed to
              space) weather or night time.
