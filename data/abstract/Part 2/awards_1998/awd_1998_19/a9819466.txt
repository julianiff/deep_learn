A statewide collaborative in Michigan requests 48 months
              funding to train 150 middle school mathematics teacher leaders.  Seventy-five,
              six-person leadership teams will be selected from 75 districts to lead their
              respective districts to implement NSF-developed exemplary middle school
              mathematics programs through a school professional development plan.  Each team
              will consist of two middle school mathematics teachers, one high school
              mathematics teacher, one administrator, and at least one community member.  The
              leadership team will develop school action plans in two one-day professional
              development meetings.  In years 2-4 the middle school teachers will attend
              two-week summer workshops, and six one-day workshops each year.  They will also
              offer six one-hour professional development programs to the school mathematics
              teachers each year.
