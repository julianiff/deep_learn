              ABSTRACT

Kulkarni, Shrinivas
"Neutron Star and Pulsar
              Studies"
AST-9819926

This is a comprehensive multiwavelength investigation
              of pulsars, neutron stars, accreting X-ray binaries and related collapsed
              objects such as soft gamma ray repeaters and magnetars. The radio observatories
              at Arecibo, Green Bank, Parkes (Australia), optical observatories at Palomar
              and Keck, and space-based facilities will be used to pursue two main
              objectives:  (1) the identification and study of new classes of neutron stars
              such as soft gamma ray repeaters, radio quiet neutron stars, X-ray pulsars and
              young pulsars in supernova remnants;  (2) high precision timing of binary and
              millisecond pulsars.
