Abstract    :
              Merrifield 9819519
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated
              experiment near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough
              topography are responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to
              identify the major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate
              energy budget for the region. This modeling effort will focus primarily on the
              issue of tidal scattering as an energy source for ocean mixing using two
              numerical models of the baroclinic (depth-dependent) tide.
