              ABSTRACT
9819807

The Pixon method of image processing will be applied to
              interferometric imaging for radio astronomy.  Pixon software will be developed
              for the AIPS++ radio astronomy software package.  The method will be optimized
              for speed and applied to real interferometric data for comparison with existing
              techniques.  At the end of the project Pixon code is to be available for
              distribution to the scientific community.
