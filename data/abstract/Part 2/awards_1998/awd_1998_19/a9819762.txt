Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
9819762

A phase-binning polarization capability is to be added to a
              CCD camera for the sensitive detection of pulsations in the optical light of
              isolated, rotation powered pulsars.  The camera was funded under an earlier NSF
              grant.  The camera will be used on the 4-m CTIO Blanco telescope to observe
              southern hemisphere pulsars.
