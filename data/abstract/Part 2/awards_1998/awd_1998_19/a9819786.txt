Thompson, Ian
"Collaborative Project: Distances and Ages from
              Detached Eclipsing Binary Stars"
AST-9819786

This is a multi-pronged
              collaborative investigation of newly discovered eclipsing binary stars with
              Bohdan Paczynski at Princeton University (AST-9819787).  The goal is to provide
              distance determinations, compositions and ages for stars in globular clusters
              and the Magellanic Clouds found during the course of the Optical Gravitational
              Lensing Experiment (OGLE).  An extensive observational effort will be
              undertaken to obtain photometric and spectroscopic observations of OGLE
              binaries from which distances, masses and radii can be determined using
              standard techniques.  These measurements, made for an unprecedented large
              number of binaries, will provide firm tests of stellar evolution theory,
              further constrain globular cluster ages, and thus contribute improved minimum
              age estimates for the Galaxy and Universe at large.
