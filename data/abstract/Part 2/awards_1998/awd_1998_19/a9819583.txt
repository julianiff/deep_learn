This proposal in the area of Teacher Enhancement is a
              five-year Teacher Leadership Project involving teachers in grades K-8 in five
              Bronx Community School Districts in New York City (districts 7, 8, 10, 11, and
              12).  The project also involves K-5 students in Community School District 9,
              which is being supported by a grade 6-9 LSC project in mathematics.  The
              proposal extends the work of the NYC Urban Systemic Initiative and the New York
              City Mathematics Project (NYCMP).  The project will involve 264 participants
              from 60 schools.  The focus of the training will be content and pedagogical
              knowledge, leadership, and involvement in broad and particular discussions
              about the direction of district- and school-based instructional adaptations. 
              The NSF-supported ARC and SHOWME Implementation Centers will be involved in
              assisting the TL=MS Project deliver professional development activities related
              to the NSF-supported elementary and middle school curriculum materials.
