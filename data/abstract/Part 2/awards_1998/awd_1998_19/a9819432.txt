Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Peter Beak in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.   The research aims to extend the
              earlier work on endocyclic atom transfer reactions to include transfers of
              fluorine, chlorine, bromine, oxygen, and sulfur.   Methods to be used include:
              1) following kinetics of the reactions with double labelling, 2) NMR spin
              saturation transfer, 3) competitive intramolecular transfers, and 4) the
              formation of transient double labelled species and surrogate intermolecular
              reporter molecules.
It is anticipated that the information obtained in the
              proposed studies will increase our understanding of the reaction profiles
              involved in atom transfer reactions, will be of theoretical interest, and will
              have practical consequences for synthesis, especially in making optically
              active compounds useful for pharmaceuticals.   Graduate students involved in
              the work will gain valuable experience in organic synthesis, product
              characterization, and kinetics and mechanism,  currently in great demand in the
              pharmaceutical industry.
