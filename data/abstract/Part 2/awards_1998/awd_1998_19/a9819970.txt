Abstract    :
              The Cretaceous period has been considered an analog for an ice-free Earth during
              which warm conditions prevailed, reflecting high atmospheric carbon dioxide
              levels.  However, evidence from the polar regions suggest that the warm periods
              during the Cretaceous were intervened by episodes of much colder temperatures. 
              An indicator of cool conditions is glendonite which is a calcium carbonate
              pseudomorph of ikaite.  Ikaite is found in rapidly deposited organic-rich
              sediments in polar regions.  Glendonites are found in the Early Cretaceous
              sediments in the Canadian Arctic, Svalbard, and northern Siberia and they may
              record a global climate signal.  The Principal Investigator will undertake both
              field and laboratory studies to construct a magnetostratigraphy in sediments of
              the Canadian Arctic (Sverdrup Basin) which contains glendonite-bearing
              horizons.  After the magnetostratigraphy is determined, he can test whether
              these cool climate indicators correspond with short-term variations in eustatic
              sea level, thus supporting periodic polar glaciation during the Cretaceous.  He
              will also conduct geochemical analyses on the glendonites to better understand
              their origins through trace element measurements and use carbon isotopes to
              examine whether methane was involved in ikaite formation.
