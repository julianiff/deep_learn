              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819103


The fact that the mineral barite, a very insoluble
              and crystalline form of barium sulfate,  is found in marine waters around the
              world is one of the mysteries of modern chemical oceanography.   Although the
              microcrystals usually have the appearance of crystals precipitated directly
              from solution, the concentration of barium is too low to provide the
              saturated-to-supersaturated solution chemistry to cause direct precipitation. 
              In this study, geochemists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
              tackle this problem by studying several of the most promising candidate
              mechanisms for barite formation.  They believe that the most likely mechanism
              would involved the generation of supersaturated conditions in the
              microenvironment around sinking, decomposing biogenic particle, but other
              possibilities (such as catalytic effects of opal surfaces and dissolution of
              celestite, abarium-rich mineral) will also be considered.  Because barite is
              relatively well preserved in marine sediments, its rate of accumulation could
              potentially provide quantitative information on past changes in oceanic export
              productivity (a measure of the ability of the ability of the phytoplankton to
              fix carbon dioxide and deliver it to depth).
