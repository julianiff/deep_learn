This local systemic change project will attempt to influence
              three dimensions of middle-school culture by enhancing teaching
              (standards-based content and conceptual and procedural scientific literacy),
              learning (inquiry-based), and curriculum (NSF developed programs:  e.g. SEPUP,
              FOSS and "Issues, Evidence and You").  The plan builds on two elementary-level,
              NSF-supported reform efforts and envisages a four-year initiative of
              professional development involving teachers, administrators, scientists,
              facilitators and parents.

This Middle School Science and Technology Reform
              Project extends an inquiry-oriented, contemporary science program to include a
              technology dimension -- defined as the applications of science skills -- to
              develop new knowledge.

This four-year initiative is planned to serve about
              17,000 mostly ethnic minority and low income students.
