The investigators will develop a new generation
              magnetosheath model for a wide range of solar wind parameters and realistic
              magnetopause shapes.  Many studies of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction
              require quantitative models for magnetosheath parameters.  Such models are
              needed to time the arrival of solar wind features, determine whether conditions
              at the magnetopause are favorable for reconnection, and to describe the
              magnetosheath plasma parameter input into the cusp and mantle.  The only
              existing models are gas dynamic models which neglect the magnetic field.  The
              investigators will develop a new model based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). 
              The results of this model will be compared to existing gas dynamic models and
              to empirical models developed from in situ satellite data.  The results will
              also be used to discriminate between various proposed modes of magnetic merging
              on the dayside magnetopause.  The MHD magnetosheath model will help improve the
              understanding of the plasma processes and energy transfer in the solar
              wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system and help assess the terrestrial
              environmental variations due to changes in the solar wind and interplanetary
              magnetic field.
