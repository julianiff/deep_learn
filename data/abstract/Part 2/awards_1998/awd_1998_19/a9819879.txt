Abstract    :
              This program will utilize a combination of two computational techniques to
              investigate the penetration of high energy particles from the solar wind into
              the Earth's magnetosphere.  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations will be used
              to determine the general interior structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere
              and a large-scale kinetic (LSK) code will be used to trace test particles to
              determine where, how, and when energetic particles penetrate the magnetopause
              and enter the magnetosphere.  Particle tracing will then also be used to
              determine how these energetic particles are transported within the
              magnetosphere
