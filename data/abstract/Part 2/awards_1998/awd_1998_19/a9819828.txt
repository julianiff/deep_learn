Abstract    :
              This collaborative research examines the ways in which ideas and knowledge
              develop, move between social and academic practices, and become relevant for
              different social agents in different social contexts. It addresses questions
              such as, 'How does social science research reflect and influence social
              debates?' and 'How do social debates reflect and influence social science
              research?'  The project begins from the assumption that the flow of ideas
              between academic researchers and other social agents continually transforms the
              knowledge in question, making it more or less relevant.  'Relevance' is defined
              as a relationship between lived experience (of both academic and other agents)
              and the social, political, and individual uses of knowledge.  The PIs will 1)
              analyze the geographical literature on public space (performing both content
              and citation analyses); 2) interview academic public space researchers about
              academic and social influences on and goals of their public space research; 3)
              examine specific public space controversies in four US cities; and 4) interview
              people directly involved in those controversies about their public space
              knowledge, the importance (or lack of importance) of geographical research on
              public space.  From this information base, the patterns of influence and
              relevancy within and between academic researchers and social agents will be
              examined.
