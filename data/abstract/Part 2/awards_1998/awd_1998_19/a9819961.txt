This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will
              provide equipment in support of oceanographic research on R/V Pelican, a
              research vessel operated by the consortium as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific equipment to be
              acquired includes a wire spooling machine, a dive compressor/cascade system, a
              12 kHz tracking upgrade, modifications to the trawl winch, and a computer for
              use by ship's  personnel.   The shared-use equipment supported here will assist
              marine scientists conducting studies from R/V Pelican, particularly in  the
              Gulf of Mexico, during 1999 and future years.
