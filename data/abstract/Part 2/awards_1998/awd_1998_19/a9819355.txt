Abstract    :
              Forward

      Many estuarine crustaceans have planktonic larvae that develop
              in coastal/shelf areas and then return to estuaries as postlarvae.  This study
              is designed to test the hypothesis that estuarine crustaceans use chemical and
              physical cues (1) for up-estuary transport, settlement, and metamorphosis of
              postlarvae (megalopae) and (2) for retention and juveniles (J1-J3 instars) in
              specific habitats.  Using the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, as a
              representative species, stimulatory and inhibitory chemical cues will first be
              tested in a chemical choice tube to determine effective concentration ranges
              for behavioral responses that are potentially involved in habitat location. 
              Further laboratory experiments with a paddle wheel flume will study settlement
              site location behavior and settlement in the presence of realistic flow
              conditions, chemical cues and structure.  Finally, the effects of stimulatory
              and inhibitory cues on metamorphosis will be determined.  This information will
              permit a better understanding of the conditions necessary for successful
              completion of the postlarval and early juvenile phases of the life cycle of
              some estuarine crustaceans and the development of an integrative descriptive
              model of the behavioral responses to environmental stimuli during the
              transition from a planktonic phase (postlarval) to a mostly benthic existence
              as a juvenile in a nursery habitat.
