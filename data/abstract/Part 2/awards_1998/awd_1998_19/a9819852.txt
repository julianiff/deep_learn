As a result of a joint US-South Africa Workshop on Multiphase
              Systems in Mineral and Chemical Processing held in South Africa in June 1997, a
              cooperative research program has been initiated between Professor Jan Miller
              and Professor John Davidtz of Potchefstroom University in South Africa. 
              Researchers at Potchefstroom University have completed a substantial amount of
              applied research, which has involved the study of new reagents for the
              flotation separation of strategic minerals, including minerals containing the
              platinum-group metals.  Already this applied research is being supported by the
              Foundation for Research Development (FRD) in South Africa.  On the other hand,
              fundamental studies are lacking.  In this regard, a cooperative research
              program with the University of Utah is planned to establish the fundamental
              flotation chemistry associated with these new reagents.  The research group at
              the University of Utah has extensive experience in flotation chemistry, and as
              a part of the program a South African student, Ms. Ronel du Plessis, has
              already started graduate studies.  In addition to fundamental studies, ore
              samples from US industries will be examined to evaluate the new reagents, which
              should be an important activity to support South African industrial
              development.  The results of this research work will be useful for the
              development of new technology in the minerals industries for the recovery of
              platinum, copper, and other metals of strategic importance to both countries.
