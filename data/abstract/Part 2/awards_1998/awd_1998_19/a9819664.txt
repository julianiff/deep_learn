This award to University of California at San Diego will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the Oceanographic Data
              Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as specific
              instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the institution,
              R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul.  All four of these research
              vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes computers and peripherals for both shipboard and laboratory
              use, a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system, and echosounder
              transceivers and transducers for measuring water depth. The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies
              worldwide on SIO and other research vessels during 1999 and future
              years.
