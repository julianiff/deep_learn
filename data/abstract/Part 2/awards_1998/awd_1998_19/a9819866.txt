Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to understand how faulting and magmatism at
              mid-ocean ridges interact to form the surficial and internal structure of
              oceanic lithosphere.  The models to be developed may allow predictions about
              the structure and dynamics of ridges that can be tested with new and existing
              data.  A newly developed numerical model that allows for formation of faults in
              a brittle material will be applied to the problem of faulting in the crust at
              mid-ocean ridges.  Faulting will be treated in both two and three
              dimensions.
