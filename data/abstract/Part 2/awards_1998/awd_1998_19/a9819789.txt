Abstract    :
               Freitag
This award to University of Rhode Island will provide instrumentation
              for oceanographic research for use on R/V Endeavor, a research vessel operated
              by the university's Graduate School of Oceanography as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired is a winch to support a towed, undulating sensor
              package acquired with 1998 NSF support for oceanographic and biological
              measurements.  In addition, the present award includes support for bottles for
              sampling sea water for physical and chemical oceanographic research. The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              studies, particularly in  the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, in 1999 and future
              years.
