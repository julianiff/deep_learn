Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an optimized strain for 
converting
              methanol into higher value added products by directed 
metabolic engineering
              of a methylotrophic bacterium, 
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.  The
              hypothesis to be tested is 
that energy metabolism can be optimized and carbon
              flux can be 
directed to specific metabolic branches by manipulating
              
formaldehyde production and consuption pathways.  This award is
made by NSF
              as part of the joint NSF/EPA Program on Technologies
for a Sustainable
              Environment.
