Abstract    :
              In this project the strategy in the design of a new generation of solid-state
              ionic devices is the use of mesoporous electrodes of mixed ionic-electronic
              conductions (MIEC) and nonostructured interfaces.  The advantages offered by
              mesoporous or nanostructured materials include dramatically increased active
              surface areas for fast electrode kinetics, a significantly increased populaiton
              of defects , shorter diffusion lengths for rapid mass and charge trnasport, and
              increased flexibility in surface modificaiton for catalysis.  The objective of
              this proposal is to develop a synthesis and processing procedure for
              preapartion of mesoporous MIEC electrodes and nanostructured interfaces using a
              liquid crystal templating mechanism and a sol-gel process.  The study will
              result in a deeper understanding of the principles of mesoporous MIEC
              electrodes, including simultaneous transport of ionic and electronic defects in
              the solid MIEC, gas transport throught he pores of the MIEC, and the reaction
              kinetics at the MIEC/gas interface.  A fundamental understanding of synthesis,
              processing, and properties of mesoporous MIEC electrodes and nanostructured
              interfaces is essential to the rational design of a new generation of
              solid-state ionic devices.  This project will potentially have a significant
              impact of energy efficiency and environmental quality.
