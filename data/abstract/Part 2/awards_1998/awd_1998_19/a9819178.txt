This project will aim to study systematically the effects of
              rare earth ion incorporation into the structure of discrete silicon
              nanoparticles of varying size.  The nanoparticles will be prepared by the
              co-pyrolysis of disilane and a rare earth precursor complex in a high
              temperature aerosol reactor.  The nanoparticles will be characterized by high-
              and low-resolution photoluminescence spectroscopy, transmission and high
              resolution electron microscopy, and ultraviolet and visible absorption
              spectroscopy.  The study will include an emphasis on the rare earth ions erbium
              and europium as large rare-earth doped silicon nanoparticles in the 12 to 100
              nanometer size regime, as well as in the small rare-earth doped silicon
              nanoparticle 1 to 4 nanometer size regime.  The goals include evaluating the
              role of the silicon host particle size on the photophysical properties of the
              rare earth center, especially energy transfer, and assessing the possibility of
              large silicon nanoparticles acting as optical cavities for the enhancement of
              rare earth ion luminescence.

This project aims to establish the
              fundamental physical and chemical properties, to include optical and magnetic
              properties of nanoparticles that strongly depend on not only the chemical
              composition, but also on the size of the particle.  From progress in this area
              of nanosciences it is predicted that circuits and devices based on nanoclusters
              exhibiting novel optical, magnetic and electronic properties will enable the
              shrinkage of a computational or information storage unit to near molecular
              dimensions as well as decrease the power requirements of these units orders of
              magnitude less than currently needed.
