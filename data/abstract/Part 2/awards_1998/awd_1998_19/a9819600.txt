This project requests travel support for 15 participants from U.S.
              universities in the Student Paper Competition at the 1999 IEEE MTT-S
              International Microwave Symposium (IMS).
The IMS is the annual meeting of the
              Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical
              and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  The IMS is also the major international
              symposium in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless
              telecommunications.  The 1999 IMS will be held in Anaheim, CA on June 13-17,
              1999.
Each year, the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society promotes student
              education in microwave theory and techniques through a number of mechanisms. 
              One of the most important mechanisms is the Student Paper Competition at the
              IMS.  This selective program brings the world's best students together in an
              integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical
              audience but also to a group of judges.  The program helps develop the
              students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation
              skills.  It also helps introduce them to the international technical community
              and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of
              microwave engineers.
The IMS provides financial support of various forms but
              does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that
              the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S.
              universities.
