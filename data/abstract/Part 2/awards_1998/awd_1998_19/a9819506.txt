Support is provided to study the outflow of the Red Sea into
              the Gulf of Aden and to trace its path into the Indian Ocean.  The Red Sea
              Outflow differs from other such flows in its low latitude position, the shallow
              sill control, and a seasonal variability in transport.  Little has been done to
              describe this flow quantitatively.  Observations proposed included:  1.  Two
              high-resolution hydrographic and direct velocity surveys of the western Gulf of
              Aden, at times of maximum (winter) and minimum (summer) transport;  2.  Direct
              measurements of turbulent mixing to study bottom and entrainment stresses; and,
              3.  Deployment of acoustically tracked RAFOS floats to track the flow into the
              Indian Ocean.
