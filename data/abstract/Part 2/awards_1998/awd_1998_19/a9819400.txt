Laboratory measurements of accurate
              absolute atomic transition probabilities for the spectral lines of selected
              lanthanide "rare earth" elements TbII, EuII and LaII are being made.  Stellar
              astronomers studying the abundance patterns of heavy elements throughout the
              Galactic disk and halo need data on these species.  It is the uncertainty in
              transition probabilities (g-f values) which contribute the largest single
              source of uncertainty to many current observational determinations of stellar
              abundance.  These results will be of particular value in studies of chemically
              peculiar stars.  The measurements will be made by combining radiative lifetimes
              derived from time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence with branching fractions
              obtained from Fourier transform spectroradiometry.  As time permits other
              lanthanide elements such as GdII, YbII and LuII will be included in the
              study.
