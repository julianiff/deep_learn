A large coordinated experiment (HOME: Hawaiian Ocean Mixing
              Experiment) is underway near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with
              rough topography are responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals
              of the experiments are to identify the major energy pathways for ocean mixing
              and achieve an approximate energy budget for the region. Following historical
              analysis, modeling and  survey work, the Near-field experiment of the HOME
              project focuses on the investigation of the dynamical processes in the
              immediate vicinity of the Hawaiian Ridge, and especially the response to
              barotropic tidal forcing including generation  of low- and high-mode internal
              waves, propagation and turbulent dissipation and mixing. This sub-project will
              focus on understanding the characteristics of the internal tide and the
              internal wave field in the upper 600 m. The research platform FLIP will be
              moored for about 40 days during Spring tides on the South edge of the ridge,
              approximately 20 km west of Kaena Pt. A rapidly profiling CTD and a lowered
              up-looking, high resolution sonar will be used to provide real-time display of
              the stratification, velocity shear and stability of the water column, enabling
              real-time modification of sampling strategies by the mobile components of the
              experiment.
