Title:
              Preliminary 14C Dating of Sedimentary Organic Matter from Glovers Pond, New
              Jersey: Constraining the Timing of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Methane
              Changes During the Last Deglaciation

This SGER award supports AMS 14C dating
              of bulk organic matter collected from cores taken from a small marl lake in NW
              New Jersey.  Isotope data provide a detailed, continuous environmental record
              of the last deglaciation ( 18 kyrs. to Present).  This study will provide
              adequate temporal coverage of these isotopic changes.  Better age constraints
              are needed to compare this terrestrial/lacustrine record with similar European
              lacustrine records, and ice core isotopic, CO2 and CH4 data and the marine
              record.  This study will help to better understand the changes that occurred in
              atmospheric composition during the last deglaciation.
