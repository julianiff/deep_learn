Abstract    :
              This project will examine the educational outcomes of students receiving
              educational vouchers from one of three private foundations: the Oklahoma
              Scholarship Program, Children's Educational Opportunity of Michigan, and
              Students First from Birmingham, Alabama. These scholarship programs have
              awarded scholarships to lowincome families in their respective states. The
              scholarships have been allocated by lottery. The random nature of scholarship
              assignment in these organizations will be utilized to eliminate school
              selection bias. Lottery losers will serve as a control group for voucher
              winners.

The outcome data will be gathered through surveys and school
              records. The student outcomes of interest include test scores, school
              attendance, grade retention, and disciplinary actions. Additional analysis will
              focus on parental involvement in education and educational outcomes of other
              children.
