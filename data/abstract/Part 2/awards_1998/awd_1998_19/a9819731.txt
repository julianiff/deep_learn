This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will provide equipment in support of oceanographic research on
              R/V Atlantis, R/V Knorr and R/V Oeanus, three research vessels operated by the
              institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              research fleet. Specific equipment to be acquired includes fire fighting
              equipment, an air compressor, vibration monitoring equipment, exposure suits,
              an outboard engine, a sheave and tool van to support remotely-operated vehicle
              operations, an upgrade to an X-band radar, and replacement tubes for one
              rigid-hull inflatable boat.  In addition to equipment for their own vessels,
              WHOI will acquire vibration monitoring systems identical to their own to be
              installed on sister vessels R/V Wecoma (Oregon State University) and R/V
              Endeavor (University of Rhode Island), and funds are provided here for training
              of ships' personnel at all three sites.  The shared-use equipment supported
              here will assist marine scientists conduct studies from Woods Hole research
              vessels throughout the world ocean during 1999 and future years.
