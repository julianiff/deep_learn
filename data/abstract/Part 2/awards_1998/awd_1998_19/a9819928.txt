              ABSTRACT

Bjorkman, Jon
AST-9819928

This project focuses on the
              development of modeling techniques for the determination of radiation fields,
              temperatures and ionization properties for non-spherical stellar atmospheres
              and circumstellar envelopes.  Such models are critically needed to interpret a
              wide variety of new high spatial and spectral resolution observations that are
              now available for such objects as Wolf-Rayet stars, Herbig-Haro Ae/Be stars, O-
              and B-type stars, and evolving asymptotic giant branch stars.  In addition, the
              product of this research is likely to be useful in interpreting the
              observational properties of objects that have experienced explosive eruptions,
              like supernovae.  The initial effort will employ a Monte Carlo (statistical)
              approach to approximating the radiative transfer calculations of
              non-equilibrium axisymmetric and 'clumpy' atmospheres.  The new work builds
              upon a previously developed two-dimensional axisymmetric model of winds from
              rapidly rotating hot stars, the so-called "wind-compressed disk model."
