This award to Texas A&M University will provide equipment in
              support of oceanographic research on R/V Gyre, a research vessel operated by
              the university as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System research fleet. Specific equipment to be acquired is a differential
              receiver for using the Global Positioning System satellite system for accurate
              navigation.   The shared-use equipment supported here will assist marine
              scientists conduct studies from R/V Gyre, particularly in  the Gulf of Mexico,
              during 1999 and future years.
