This is a five-year project that will involve 30 middle- and
              high-school science teachers each year in a six-week summer program. The
              program includes research and transfer to classroom activities.  During the
              first week there is group observation and study of local biological phenomena. 
              For the next four weeks teachers make observations of other phenomena on their
              own.  Scientists will serve as mentors during this time.  The sixth and final
              week is devoted to planning the use of the inquiry approach in the classroom.
              Teachers will communicate through an electronic "chat room" during the academic
              year to continue their interactions.  Research experiences are offered at five
              different sites throughout Florida over the five years of the project.
