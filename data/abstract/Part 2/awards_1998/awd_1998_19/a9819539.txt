The recommended project will analyze the spectra of
              broadband ambient noise data acquired on the borehole B3S2 seismometer in the
              Ocean Seismic Network Pilot Experiment, a group of three seismometers installed
              at the OSN-1 site in and around ODP Hole 843B, located 225 km SW of Oahu,
              Hawaii. These seismometers were installed in the borehole, buried in mud
              (ooze), and on top of the seafloor sediments. The project will focus on
              computing and analyzing the ambient noise spectra, especially in regards to the
              spectral time dependence, correlation of the spectra with environmental data
              (eg. wind, atmospheric pressure and other weather phenomena, sea state, and
              bottom currents), and comparison of the spectra with those from the buried and
              seafloor OSN-1 seismometers and previous seafloor and sub-seafloor seismometer
              data sets.  Evaluation of this data will lead to recommendations for revised
              designs and future OSN installations.
