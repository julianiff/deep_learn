Abstract    :
              This research program is designed to utilize data obtained from the Los Alamos
              National Laboratory (LANL) Geosynchronous satellites to improve the
              Magnetospheric Specification Model (MSM) developed at Rice University.  The
              project is a joint program with Rice University (R. A. Wolf, PI).  The project
              will investigate methods of assimilating near real-time energetic particle data
              from the LANL satellites into the MSM.  The project will also explore the
              sensitivity of the model output to the input data and will determine which
              input parameters  provide the most useful improvements to the model output. 
              Additionally, the project will make changes to the MSM code to make us of
              advances in computer capabilities
