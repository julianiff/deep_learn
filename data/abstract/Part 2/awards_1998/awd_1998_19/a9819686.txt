Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical particle physics will include work on superstring theory
              and quantum gravity, supersymmetric gauge theories, and analytical and
              numerical studies in quantum chromodynamics.  Superstring theory is the leading
              candidate for a unified theory that has revealed deep connections between
              gravity and other fundamental forces in nature.  Quantum chromodynamics is the
              theory of the strong nuclear forces that describes the confinement of quarks
              within nucleons.  Thus the investigations that will be undertaken are of
              importance in furthering our understanding of the physics of the elementary
              particles.
