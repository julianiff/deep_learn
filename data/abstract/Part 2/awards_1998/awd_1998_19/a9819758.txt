Proposal Summary: 
Proton precession magnetometers, which measure
              total field intensities, have long been the instrument of choice for marine
              geophysical studies. Unfortunately, these instruments are subject to
              limitations, especially over N-S oriented ridges near the equator and anywhere
              that lineated short-wavelength anomalies or non-lineated fine-scale anomalies
              exist.

Vector magnetic field measurements provide a means to reduce or
              overcome these limitations of total field anomaly data. Horizontal and vertical
              components of the anomalous field are always greater than the total field
              anomaly, and these vector anomalies are significantly less affected by
              unfavorable geometries in equatorial regions. The PI's made initial tests of a
              vector magnetometer onboard a ship, but the ship's magnetic field introduced
              errors. They also tested a system on a deep towed vehicle. This method showed
              promise, but they did not have adequate motion compensation data. Therefore,
              the PI's, J. Gee and S. Cande, propose to develop a towed vector field
              magnetometer system. The system will use a SeaTex MRU-6 motion reference unit
              with triaxial magnetometers in a cylindrical anodized aluminum pressure case
              that is suitable for full ocean depth deployment. A towed system with a high
              precision motion sensor should eliminate the two significant sources of noise
              found in initial tests. The system will require a RS232 data transmission
              enhancer and a 300 m cable; it will be assembled at SIO. The PI proposes to
              test the system during a 4 day cruise off the coast of Hawaii where low
              amplitude anomalies (< 100 nT) exist. 

This system should allow
              identification of spreading related anomalies in significant portions of the
              ocean basins where such identifications are not possible with existing
              instrumentation.
