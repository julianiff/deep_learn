The recommended project is a marine geophysical field
              program on the Newfoundland margin, which was conjugate to the Iberia margin
              during the initial opening of the Atlantic ocean. The project will provide
              geophysical site survey data in support of JOIDES ODP Proposals 504 and
              504-Full 2. It will utilize the R/V Ewing's large, tuned airgun array and 6 krn
              streamer together with an extensive ocean-bottom seismometer array to
              seismically profile three transects that extend from known continental crust to
              known oceanic crust. The program will be conducted jointly with Canadian and
              Danish Lithosphere Centre scientists. Together with other geophysical and
              drilling data from the Iberian margin, it will provide a critical dataset for
              testing models of continental rifting, breakup, and initiation of seafloor
              spreading in a "non-volcanic" rifted environment. Specifically, it will: 1)
              characterize the nature of the crust transitional between oceanic and
              continental crust in the region; 2) provide a comparison with the Iberian
              margin, thereby allowing testing of models of pure-shear vs. simple-shear
              during rifting; and 3) determine the amount of igneous material intruded and
              extruded during rifting, providing comparative data with other "volcanic"
              rifted margins, such as the East Greenland margin.
