The Pennsylvania Science Education Network (PASEN)
              establishes a self-sustaining professional learning community for K-8 science
              education in Eastern Pennsylvania.  PASEN addresses the technology education
              needs of teachers by creating a model professional community of science
              educators, district personnel, intermediate unit staff, professional
              development experts, and science educational content providers.  By integrating
              the current science education reform efforts with PASEN, it establishes a
              systemic and electronic program that is replicable and scalable. 
 
Companion
              units are produced that tie to the state frameworks and thus support classrooms
              regardless of science textbook.  The companions support a number of
              standards-based kit programs, principally STC, FOSS, INSIGHTS, and SEPUP.  In
              addition to the workshops and ongoing support, the project includes Current
              Science News, Live Event Webcasts, Peer Forums, the Mentor Center, and the
              Publication Center.
 
In the three-year duration of the project, 200 K-8
              teachers will receive at least 122 hours of inservice education that will help
              them adapt their curriculum to the standards and integrate technology into
              teaching and learning in their schools.  This is a collaboration of the
              Franklin Institute with the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the
              Philadelphia USI, and the Center for Agile Pennsylvania, selected school
              districts, and regional science alliances.
