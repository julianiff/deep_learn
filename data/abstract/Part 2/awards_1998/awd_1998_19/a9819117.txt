Abstract    :
              This project is a comprehensive field and laboratory program that involves
              coordinated seismic, petrologic and theoretical modeling studies along an
              800-km-long section of the Galapagos spreading center between 91 and 98 degrees
              west.  The objectives of the project are to:  (1) determine how the
              compensation of the Galapagos swell is partitioned between variations in
              crustal thickness and mangle density by measuring crustal thickness along the
              swell and the degree of melting inferred from the chemistry of basalts, (2)
              determine if there is a threshold factor that controls the transition from an
              axial high to a rift valley, (3) determine how the extent of magmatic
              differentiation of ridge basalts relates to the presence or absence of a melt
              lens, and (4) determine why the degree of partial melting appears to be lower
              near the hotspot.
