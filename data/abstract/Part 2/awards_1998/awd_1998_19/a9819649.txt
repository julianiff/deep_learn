This award to University of California San Diego will provide
              equipment in support of oceanographic research on R/Vs Melville, Revelle and
              Sproul, research vessels operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography as
              part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific equipment to be acquired includes an upgrade for the Melville's
              dynamic positioning system, refurbishment and installation of a crane on
              Sproul, GMDSS transceivers for Sproul, crane modifications for Revelle, a
              fiber-optic scientific information system for Melville, a new high intensity
              searchlight for Revelle, installation of an acoustic doppler current profiling
              system on Sproul, GPS vessel attitude sensors for Sproul, remotely-operated
              searchlights (replacement) for Melville, and handheld VHF radios for Melville. 
               The shared-use equipment supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              studies from Scripps' research fleet worldwide during 1999 and future years.
