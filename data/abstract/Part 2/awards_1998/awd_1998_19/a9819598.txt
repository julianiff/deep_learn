Abstract    :
              This proposal will investigate the spatial extent and temporal evolution of the
              ionospheric total electron content (TEC) and density altitude/latitude
              structure at mid and sub-auroral latitudes as a function of solar cycle,
              season, and level of geomagnetic activity.  Existing observations taken over
              two solar cycles with the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar and available
              in the on-line Millstone Hill database will be the principal data set
              investigated.

Communications and navigation systems relying on
              trans-ionospheric propagation must be able to compensate for the effects of
              changing ionospheric characteristics over a wide range of temporal and spatial
              scales.  Sharp changes in total electron content (TEC) are observed associated
              with the ionospheric density trough at mid latitudes over the northeastern US. 
              An accurate characterization of these gradients and their variability is needed
              in the design and evaluation of navigation systems utilizing trans-ionospheric
              propagation in this regime.
