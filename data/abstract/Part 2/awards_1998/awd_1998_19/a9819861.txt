The 1998 IEEE-AP/URSI Conference on Antennas and Propagation
              is an annual international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of
              Electrical and Electronic Engineers(IEEE), and the Union of Radio Science
              International(URSI).  The conference regularly draws about one thousand
              participants representing academia and industry.  The Antennas and Propagation
              Society of the IEEE along with several subgroups of URSI will meet in Orlando,
              Florida at the Renaissance Hotel in July 1999.
Each year, the Antennas and
              Propagation Society promotes student participation in the conference through a
              number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper
              Competition at the conference.  This selective program brings the world's best
              students together in an integrated program in which they present their work to
              a technical audience including a group of judges.  The program helps develop
              the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation
              skills.  It also helps introduce then to the international technical community
              and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of
              antenna engineers.
The AP provides financial support of various forms
              including assistance in low cost housing, but does not reimburse travel
              expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the
              widest range of interested applicants from U.S. Universities.
This proposal
              requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for young investigators
              whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who
              lack funds and might not be able to attend without travel support.  It is
              proposed that the AP Technical Program Committee select those to receive the
              support.  The total amount requested is $14,000 on the basis of an average
              travel grant of $700 for 20 participants.
