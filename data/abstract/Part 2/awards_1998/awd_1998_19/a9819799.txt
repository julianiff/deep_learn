AST-9819799

This project is an investigation of the interaction of
              solar convection, magnetic fields and surface oscillations.  The specific goals
              of the project include achieving a better physical understanding of: (1) the
              coupling between surface and bottom boundary layers of the solar convection
              zone; (2) p-mode oscillation frequencies; (3) the oscillation modes; and (4)
              the uniqueness of models fit to data, as well as the 'inverse' problem of using
              data to set constraints on the models.  Data from GONG and SOHO will be
              compared to detailed computed simulations of magnetic and convection phenomena
              near the solar surface.  An attempt will be made to reconcile these fits to
              surface phenomena with predictions made by idealized models for convective
              layers too deep to observe directly.
