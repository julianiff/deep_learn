This award to University of North Carolina at Wilmington will
              provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Fear and
              other research vessels including R/V Cape Hatteras, a research vessel operated
              by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a high-resolution side-scan sonar system and a subbottom
              profiler system, as well as related data acquisition and processing computers
              and software  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists conduct studies, particularly on the mid-Atlantic U.S. continental
              shelf, in 1999 and future years.
