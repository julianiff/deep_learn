Abstract    :
              Levine 9819523
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget
              for the region. This mooring component of the Survey experiment will confirm
              the importance of the tide at two identified hot spots and quantified the
              enhanced level of fine-scale activity associated with significant mixing. The
              high frequency data set will also be used to validate the numerical models and
              help identify the best site for Near field experiment.
