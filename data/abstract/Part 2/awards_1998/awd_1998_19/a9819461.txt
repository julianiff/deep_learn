Physics is difficult to teach. New methods of teaching are
              clearly necessary. This proposal requests funding for a "Technology in Science
              Teaching" initiative based on adaptations of successful programs in Physics.
              This involves the creation of regional Science and Education Technology
              PartnerShips  (STEPS) through Local Physics Alliances of University Faculty and
              Teachers
The purpose of STEPs is to advise and assist physics departments in
              setting up partnerships with high school physics teachers to give them access
              to resources of the science community. STEPs uses a proven physics pedagogy
              (called the "modeling method") that fully satisfies the National Science
              Education Standards. An extensive restructuring of the physics
              curriculum
along "modeling-based instruction" is a part of the program. STEPs
              is
desined also to provide a systematic way to help teachers integrate new
              materials and activities into the high school curriculum. 
STEPS helps t o
              conduct and continuously refine workshops using tested methods that show
              significant gains in student's understanding of basic physics, using the Force
              Concept Inventory, the Mechanic's Baseline Test and other evaluative
              tools.
