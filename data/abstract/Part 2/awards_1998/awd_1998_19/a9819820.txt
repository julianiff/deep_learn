Bally, John
AST-9819820

This is an observational study whose
              primary goal is to map the outflows and jets associated with nearby molecular
              clouds and the young stellar objects within them.  The study will quantify the
              proper motions, radial velocities and excitation conditions in a number of
              outflows discovered in the course of an earlier survey by this group.  Data
              collected in 1982 will be compared to new epoch data gathered in this study to
              determine the proper motions of outflows seen.  The entire data set will be
              used for theoretical studies by several collaborators.  In a separate effort,
              irradiated jets discovered in the course of the survey work will be used as
              convenient observational probes of the collimation and acceleration
              mechanisms.
