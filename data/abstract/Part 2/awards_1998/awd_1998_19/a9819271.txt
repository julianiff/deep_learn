The U. S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics
              (USNC/RM) operates under the auspices of the NRC's Board on Earth Sciences and
              Resources.  This Committee represents the American rock mechanics community in
              the United States and internationally, identifies critical issues in rock
              mechanics that need to be addressed, and reviews the health of the science that
              serves industry and government.  The committee is comprised of ten members
              selected from industry, government and university, and includes several NAE
              members.  The expertise, judgment and strategic perspective of the USNC/RM
              serves to define and help initiate sponsored studies and other activities with
              respect to major areas of national interest for which rock mechanics issues
              represent critical input.   

The USNC/RM oversees ad hoc panels that conduct
              topical studies, which for the most part are separately funded.  This Committee
              will be convening a panel to conduct a study on "Conceptual Models of Fluid
              Infiltration in Fractured Media." - a study which has health and environmental
              applications related to underground flow of pollutants through fractured rock. 
              A separate study has just been concluded on "Seismic Signals from Mining
              Operations and the Comprehensive est Ban Treaty" (published by National Academy
              Press in July, 1998).  The USNC/RM also recognizes and confers awards for
              outstanding contributions to the basic science and engineering applications of
              rock mechanics. 

The USCN/RM meets twice annually and this award will be
              combined with funding from other federal agencies to provide support for
              strategic planning, project development, oversight, and dissemination of
              results of the Committee's work.
