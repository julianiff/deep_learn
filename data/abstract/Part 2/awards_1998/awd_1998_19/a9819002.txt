The goal of the ImaST 6th grade project is to add a third year
              to the current seventh and eighth grade IMaST program.  The project will
              develop integrated, standards-based curricula around eight new themes, as well
              as develop professional development materials that enhance teacher and
              administrator teams' promotion of systemic reform.

Connections, where
              appropriate, to Language Arts and Social Studies will be made so as to provide
              greater contextual integration and thereby enhance the opportunity for the
              learning of scientific conceptual knowledge and processes.
