Abstract    :
              The investigators will produce a three dimensional reconstruction of solar wind
              structures that interact with the Earth. The focus will be on the shape of the
              structures, the interaction of the structures with the ambient solar wind
              plasma, and the effect of the structures in modifying embedded solar magnetic
              fields.  Their approach is to upgrade a tomographic technique now in use to
              investigate the structure of the quiet solar wind in three dimensions. Several
              remotely sensed datasets will be incorporated in the analysis, and the results
              will be checked against densities, velocities, and magnetic fields measured in
              situ by spacecraft where data are available.
