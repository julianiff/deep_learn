Abstract    :
              The PI will participate in the German-funded PAGANINI project and join the
              initial geophysics leg to collect OBS and OBH data from the Middle America
              Trench.  The UTIG efforts will be focused on Profiles 5 and 6 (outboard of
              Nicoya Peninsula, and onshore/offshore profile from Sandino Forearc to Costa
              Rica, respectively).  The PI will have the primary responsibility for analysis
              and interpretation of these two profiles (out of a total of eight profiles to
              be collected).  The objective is to study the seismogenic zone through crustal
              velocity and crustal mass flux modeling.  The work also bears on future ODP
              drilling in the area for the seismogenic zone experiment.
