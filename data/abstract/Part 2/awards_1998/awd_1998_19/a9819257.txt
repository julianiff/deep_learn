Abstract    :
              This work will be a study of processes that determine the structure
and
              variability of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.   Data
describing
              the distribution of various chemical tracers will be
compared with simulations
              made with a general circulation model.
The aim is to improve modeling skill,
              gain a better understanding of
the processes that transport tracers in the
              tropical Pacific, and to
use the historical tracer data to identify variations
              in the tropical
upper-ocean circulation.  One of the tests of the model will
              be a
comparison between the model's prediction of 14C concentration in
the
              Pacific with 14C time series derived from corals in the tropical
and
              subtropical Pacific.
