Abstract    :
              Much recent research on government-society relations has pointed to the crucial
              importance of civil society in sustaining democracy.  This project by cultural
              anthropologists from Temple University compares the nature of civic
              participation and community mobilization in three impoverished neighborhoods in
              Philadelphia.  The main goals are to describe and analyze the ways urban poor
              people respond to different forms of local government activity in the context
              of large-scale economic restructuring.  Using methods of participant
              observation, formal and informal interviews, sample surveys, consensus analysis
              and archival research, the researchers will assess the impact of state
              strategies (indirect, proactive, and reactive intervention); the roles played
              by local community organizations, informal social networks, and the subjective
              meanings and identities used by local people in relating to the government. 
              The questions to be addressed include evaluating the effectiveness of
              governmental attempts to enhance civil participation; analyzing the potential
              for civil society to resist or influence change in a time of major economic
              restructuring; and evaluating means to provide resources and facilitate
              empowerment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
This research is important
              because it advances our knowledge of how local communities and organizations
              can create civil society under stressful conditions.  By comparing the
              experience in three neighborhoods in the same urban area the project will
              provide valuable new knowledge of use to urban planners as well as theorists of
              urban development.
