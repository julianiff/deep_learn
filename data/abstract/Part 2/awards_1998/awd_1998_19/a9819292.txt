Abstract    :
              Only recently have segregation scholars begun to acknowledge that change in
              neighborhood ethnic and racial composition depends upon the urban context which
              defines the set of alternatives for households making decisions about
              neighborhood relocation or settlement.  If the complexities of neighborhood
              change are to be unraveled, the effects of inter-city variations in segregation
              structure and housing markets must be better understood. The proposed research
              will develop and evaluate a hierarchical model of neighborhood change within
              cities of the Southwest.  The first phase of the project is designed to
              identify neighborhood and metropolitan level characteristics associated with
              rapid changes in the ethnic character of neighborhoods with a specific focus on
              the changing mix of Mexican and Anglo households.  The second stage of the
              project focuses on the neighborhood choices made by Mexicans and Anglos and how
              these choices are influenced by personal and household attributes in
              conjunction with contextual conditions that vary from one neighborhood to
              another and vary across the metropolitan areas in the sample. A multi-scale
              methodology will be used that incorporates hierarchical statistical techniques
              for analyzing linear and non-linear effects at several scales, geographical
              information systems to analyze spatially-based neighborhood attributes, and
              analysis of geo-coded samples from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
