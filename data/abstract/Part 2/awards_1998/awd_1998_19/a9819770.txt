              ABSTRACT


AST-9819770
Howell, Steve

Dr. Howell proposes an extensive
              observational and theoretical investigation of cataclysmic variable (CV) stars.
               CVs consist of a close pair of interacting stars in which the primary is a
              white dwarf accreting from a cooler normal main sequence star.  Typical orbital
              periods are less than 12 hours.  Such binary pairs are important because they
              provide an evolutionary bridge between some types of massive white dwarf stars
              that cannot easily result from normal single star evolution and supernova,
              often use as distance indicators to other galaxies because they are so bright. 
              Since they are evolving rapidly, CVs also provide useful constraints on the
              white dwarfs masses, which are otherwise very difficult to determine, and on
              theoretical models of mass exchange in close binaries. Dr. Howell intends to
              greatly improve the observational coverage of fainter, shorter period CVs in
              order to test the hypothesis that short period CVs are in fact the most common
              type.  The observations will also provide a robust test of theoretical models
              that predict that orbital periods reach a minimum at about 2 hours.  Additional
              IR spectra obtained will yield important information on the physical
              characteristics of the thin accretion disks as well as the often hidden stellar
              components in fainter pairs.  The observing facilities available at the
              University of Wyoming's Infrared Observatory (WIRO), Red Buttes Observatory
              (RBO) and University of Florida Rosemary Hill Observatory (RHO) will provide
              most of the photometric light curves and infrared spectroscopy.
