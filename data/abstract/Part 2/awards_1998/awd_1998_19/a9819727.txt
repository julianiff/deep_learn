The
              origin and emergence of magnetic fields on the surface of the Sun and its
              relationship to active regions and flares will be investigated by comparing
              theoretical models to data collected at ground- and space-based facilities. The
              study has three main objectives:  (1) how magnetic flux emerges from the solar
              interior and manifests itself as an active region;  (2) to determine which
              physical properties of active regions are most closely associated with flares,
              and  (3) to identify why those physical properties are associated with flares. 
              Previous work has suggested that a 'kink instability' is associated with
              so-called 'd-spot active regions' thought to be closely associated with flare
              activity.  Detailed magneto-hydrodyamic and radiative transport physics will be
              incorporated into new models of buoyant magnetic flux tubes.  Comparison of
              these models with high resolution observations will provide a strong test of
              the hypothesis that rising unstable flux tubes 'disconnect' from their magnetic
              roots and manifest the observed properties of d-spot active regions.  The
              results of this study are likely to be applicable to other cool stars that
              exhibit surface activity.
