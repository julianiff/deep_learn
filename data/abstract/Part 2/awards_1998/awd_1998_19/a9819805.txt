Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue a program of research on the morphology and
              dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere, focussing on the dynamic connection between
              auroral ionospheric regions and distant magnetospheric regions.  Research
              topics include (1) auroral oval shape, conjugacy and dependence on the
              interplanetary magnetic field, (2) dayside auroral phenomena, (3)
              geosynchronous substorm phenomena, and (4) the role of the middle magnetosphere
              in driving auroral arc currents.  The studies will make use of DMSP and POLAR
              satellite data, and geosynchronous satellite data when available.  A common
              theme in these studies is that the middle magnetosphere has a much more
              important role to play in discrete auroral phenomena.
