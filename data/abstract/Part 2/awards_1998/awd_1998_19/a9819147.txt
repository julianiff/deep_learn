Abstract    :
              PI will calibrate the chemical and stable isotopic composition of sclerosponges
              for use as a proxy for climate and ocean chemistry changes.  Extant sponges
              from Caribbean, Exuma Sound and jamaica will be used.  Previously strained
              sclerosponges are available from Jamaica.  Exuma Sound is one of the few places
              in the world from which a suitable collection of sclerosponges collected over
              wide depth range is available.  This will allow the opportunity to test
              whenther sclerosponges can be used to reconstruct ancient thermoclines.
