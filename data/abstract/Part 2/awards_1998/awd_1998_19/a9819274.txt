Abstract    :
              	This research seeks to examine how state repression influences dissidents and
              dissident activity.  In order to accomplish this objective, I identify
              inter-group relations without overt repression being observed, that is, the
              nature of group communication, planning/carrying through different activities,
              and so forth.  This information is obtained from reading/coding police ("Red
              Squad") files about a group called the Republic of New Africa (RNA) that was
              observed weekly from 1968 to 1975.  This information is supplemented by
              newspaper reports from four different newspapers which vary in terms of
              ethnicity and political orientation.  The construction of these five data sets
              facilitates examination within the "black box" of a social movement,
              identifying what happens within them on a weekly basis.  The data sets also
              facilitate examination of what (if anything) changes when repressive behavior
              is directed against dissidents.  Finally, the research allows us to understand
              better how each of the data sources themselves might be biased in terms of what
              they do and do not report.  As a consequence, the research proposal contributes
              simultaneously to several areas of research.
