Abstract    :
              This request is for travel funds to permit 15 graduate students to attend the
              29th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium on Coastal Systems, Nov 13-15, 1998. 
              The primary objective of the Symposium is to facilitate the exchange of
              information about progress of research into the dynamics of various coastal
              systems.  Prominent coastal scientists will review the state of knowledge in
              their particular specialty, present their current research, and fit that
              research into the advancing state of knowledge. An added part of this proposal
              is that the students selected for travel awards will participate in a poster
              session which will allow them to present their own research and to receive
              valuable feedback from the experts in their fields.
