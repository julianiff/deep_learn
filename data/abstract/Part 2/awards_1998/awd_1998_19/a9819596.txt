This is a three-year project.  Each year it will involve 24
              science teachers and 48 of their high potential students in a research
              experience at the University of Missouri-St. Louis or other collaborating
              research institutions in the region.  Research areas teachers and students may
              select from include anthropology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer
              science, earth science, engineering, physics, and psychology or mathematics. 
              The research is done with collaborating scientists in a six-week summer
              program. Participants are prepared for the research experience through formal
              instruction in data analysis, laboratory procedures, and seminars.  Eight
              academic-year follow-up meetings at different research sites provide an
              opportunity for teachers and their student team members to share with program
              peers and other invited teachers and students.  Transfer of the research
              experience to the classroom is facilitated by the development of lesson plans
              relating to the use of the laboratory information from their research
              experience. An electronic bulletin board will enable continued interaction
              among participants.
