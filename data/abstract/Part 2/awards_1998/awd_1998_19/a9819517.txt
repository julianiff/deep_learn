Abstract    :
              Luther 9819517
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the 
Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              
responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major 
energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy
              budget 
for the region. This component will analyze historical  data collected
              in 
the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands to help guide the survey program in
              
determining the location and ubiquity of regions where strong mixing activity
              
takes place.
