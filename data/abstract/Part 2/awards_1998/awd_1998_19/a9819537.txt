Abstract    :
              Sanford 9819537
    
It is proposed to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the Hawaiian 
Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the 
mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways 
for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy
              budget for the region. The 
Survey experiment will address the problem of
              finding a Nearfield site through 
broad ranging and focused survey. In
              particular, this project will examine the 
relationship between internal tidal
              energy, finescale shear, energy flux 
divergence, dissipation and ridge
              topography by conducting high resolution full 
water column profiles.
