              ABSTRACT

Johns-Krull, Christopher
AST-9819772

This project utilizes an
              innovative technique involving observations of Zeeman-broadened optical and
              infrared absorption lines to measure the magnetic field strength and active
              region 'filling factor' on the surfaces of young T Tauri stars. 
              Spectrophotometry is also used to quantify the temporal variation and complex
              geometry of the surface fields.  These observations will provide strong
              constraints on current stellar 'turbulent dynamo models' for the origin and
              pervasiveness of magnetic activity on young T Tauri stars.  They also are also
              likely to lead to significant improvements in understanding the magnetic
              connection between the inner boundary of accretion disks and young stellar
              photospheres.
