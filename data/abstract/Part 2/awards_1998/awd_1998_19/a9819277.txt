Abstract    :
              This award through the special activity Technology Integrated in Education will
              support a test bed activity in rural, poor school districts.  The project will
              be modeled on InTech 6, the successful Georgia Framework for Integrating
              Technology.  Louisiana, with five other states, will provide professional
              development and equipment to teachers, to enable schools to fully adopt
              technology-assisted instruction
