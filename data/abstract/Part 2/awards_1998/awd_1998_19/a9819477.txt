This award to University of California at San Barbara with
              subcontract to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts will
              support maintenance of the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), a deep ocean mooring
              near Bermuda in the central western Atlantic Ocean.  Support here, in
              collaboration with a companion award from the Office of Naval Research, will
              replace most components of the existing mooring during this 2-year period. 
              This full ocean depth mooring provides a test platform for a variety of
              oceanographic instrumentation, and is important in development of new sensors
              for ocean monitoring.  It also provides a nearly continuous time series of
              measurements of oceanographic parameters (physical, chemical and biological) as
              well as impact of atmospheric events including hurricanes.  It is an important
              component of ongoing research into the links between ocean and
              atmosphere.
