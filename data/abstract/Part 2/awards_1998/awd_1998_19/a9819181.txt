              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819181


Primary production in the ocean is important not
              only for the functioning of the marine ecosystem but also for its pivotal role
              in regulating sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide, the most important
              atmospheric greenhouse gas.  In this study, the principal investigator will use
              an indirect method to determine the net annual oxygen production in the
              northwest Pacific Ocean by measuring eleven profiles of O2, N2, and Ar
              concentrations in the upper ocean at the Japanese Joint Global Ocean Flux Study
              (JGOFS) time-series station.  The time-series station is located in what is
              probably the most biologically productive region of the North Pacific, and the
              oxygen flux estimates are expected to provide the first good estimates of the
              regional primary production.  The PI will be taking advantage of a unique
              opportunity to participate in Japanese JGOFS cruises in this region between
              1998 and 2000.
