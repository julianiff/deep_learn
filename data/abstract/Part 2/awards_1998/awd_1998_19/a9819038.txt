Abstract    :
              Four volcanic features near the Samoan hotspot will be dredged.  Dating and
              geochemical analysis of the dredge rocks will help document the existence of an
              active hotspot, its probable location, and the possible contamination of the
              volcanism by subducted material from the Tonga Trench.  The samples will also
              provide basalt glass quenched at great enough water depth to ensure retention
              of a full complement of rare gases and other volatiles.
