Abstract    :
              Worcester/Dushaw

Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated
              experiment near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough
              topography are responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to
              identify the major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate
              energy budget for the region. A companion modeling effort will focus primarily
              on the issue of tidal scattering as an energy source for ocean mixing while a
              historical analysis of data collected in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands
              will help guide the survey program in determining the location and ubiquity of
              regions where strong mixing activity takes place. Under this particular
              component of the Farfield experiment, a tomographic array will be deployed on
              either side of the Hawaiian ridge to quantify the barotropic energy flux
              convergence at the ridge and the flux divergence associated with low mode
              baroclinic waves radiation. The difference is a measure of the tidal power
              available for mixing at the Ridge.
