Abstract    :
              This project will analyze trace metals in planktic and benthic forminifera from
              plankton, sediment-trap, and sediment samples collected from the Southern
              Ocean.  The goal is to assess the potential of Cd, Ba, Mg and Sr as tracers of
              environmental conditions, and the degree of diagenetic effects. Downcore
              studies will be used to produce new high-resolution paleochemical records of
              surface and deep Southern Ocean waters during the last glacial.interglacial
              cycle.
