This
              project will be conducted on a glacier on an arctic upland on Ellesmere Island,
              Canada that extends down to an elevation approximately equivalent to the
              elevation of the average snow line.  That relationship makes this glacier very
              sensitive to climate change and critical to the onset or retreat of the
              glacier.  Even a small warming would affect the position of the grounding line
              of the glacier under these conditions.  Therefore this study will be able to
              identify the critical conditions necessary for the onset of widespread retreat
              of glaciers under predicted global change scenarios.  The project involves an
              extensive field program and utilization of existing climate stations on
              Ellesmere Island to determine the important climate variables and feedbacks of
              the air-land-ice system that drives glacial retreat and advance.  This project
              could determine both the dynamics of the climate-glacier system and possibly
              detect ongoing glacial response to observed arctic warming.
