Abstract    :
              The investigator will make the data obtained by the Bruny Island Radio
              Spectrometer available for Space Weather prediction.  These data are in the
              frequency range from 3 MHz to 47 MHz and bridge the gap between ground-based
              and space-based solar burst observations.  Observations in this frequency range
              are important for Space Weather prediction because they cover a range of
              heights in the solar atmosphere where many disturbances die away while others
              originate and propagate out into the interplanetary medium.  Improvements to
              the Spectrometer would be made to enhance its temporal coverage, sensitivity,
              and reliability.  A modest scientific program would be carried out to evaluate
              the effectiveness of the Bruny Island data in the context of Space Weather
              prediction.
