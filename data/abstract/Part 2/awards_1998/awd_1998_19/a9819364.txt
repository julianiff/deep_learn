This project in the area of Teacher Enhancement is a 40-month
              Local Systemic Change in Mathematics (LSCM) Project involving over 260
              elementary teachers and administrators from six school districts in
              southwestern Michigan (Traverse City, Battle Creek, Lakeshore, Portland, and
              Vicksburg Public Schools and Holland Christian School) who have recently
              adopted the NSF-supported Investigations in Number, Data, and Space mathematics
              curriculum.  The specific objectives of the project include:  improving
              teachers' mathematical content knowledge; extending teachers' pedagogical
              understanding of the investigations program; fostering the development of
              teacher leaders from among the project participants; and supporting the
              schools' efforts to communicate with the community regarding issues pertaining
              to mathematics teaching and learning.  Project activities include week-long
              summer workshops involving the Investigations materials, case studies, and the
              use of samples of student work to promote critical analysis of the ways in
              which elementary students engage in mathematics.
