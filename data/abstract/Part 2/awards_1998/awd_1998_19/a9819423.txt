The recommended project will upgrade the Marine
              Physical Laboratory/Joint Oceanographic Institute Control Vehicle (CV),
              replacing its analogue data transmission system with a fully digital system
              using fiber optic technology.   This upgrade will allow the telemetry and data
              conditioning hardware to match the recent acquisition by Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography of 10 km of 0.68" electro-optical tow cable, with three optical
              fibers and three copper conductors. This upgrade will thereby allow continuous
              transmission of full-resolution video, as well as transmission without data
              loss of other CV sensor information, including navigation and sonar.  It should
              greatly improve the ease of handling the CV, and should allow it to more
              effectively be used as a bed for deployment of scientific
              instrumentation.
