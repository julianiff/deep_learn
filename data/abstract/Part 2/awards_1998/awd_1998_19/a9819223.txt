This work will examine the coupling between the general
              circulation
of the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans that occurs via the
              Agulhas 
Current system.  Combining diagnosis of existing model output,
              
stability analysis of typical Agulhas Current profiles, process 
modeling
              and an analysis of regional variability in satellite-derived 
SSH and SST
              fields, the work will focus on: (a) an investigation of 
whether westward
              propagating disturbances in the tropical Indian Ocean 
influence the
              variability of the Agulhas Current retroflection, 
together with the
              mechanisms that connect the two, and (b) a study of 
the influence of
              variability in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre 
and in the Agulhas Current
              on the composition and variability of the 
Benguela Current system.
