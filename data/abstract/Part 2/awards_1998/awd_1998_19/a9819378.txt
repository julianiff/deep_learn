Abstract    :
              The overall objectives of the Board on Physics and Astronomy are to identify
              important new developments at the scientific forefronts, foster interactions
              with other field, strengthen connections to technology, and facilitate
              effective service to the nation by the scientific community.  The membership of
              the BPA is drawn from universities, industry, and federal laboratories. 
              Meetings are devoted to reviewing activities being carried out under its
              auspices, discussing critical issues, and developing new initiatives.  In
              general, studies initiated by the BPA focusing on particular areas of physics
              or astronomy are carried out by ad hoc groups of experts in those areas.
