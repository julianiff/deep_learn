Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT


Measurements of distant extragalactic nuclei using a prototype
              spectrometer at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory have shown that there is
              a rich field of science awaiting exploration with large ground-based telescopes
              at near-THz frequencies.  Exploration of this regime, however, will require
              spectrometers with improved stability and bandwidth.

This grant supports
              construction of a dedicated new instrument that will enable observations of
              wide, weak, extragalactic lines.  Some of the development will be leveraged
              from SOFIA and FIRST observatories.  This effort will concentrate on the
              components for immediate ground-based instrumentation.  Specifically, a 3.5 GHz
              bandwidth, 256 channel cross-correlator system geared to ultra-stable,
              submillimeter spectroscopy will be developed and tested.  This will require an
              investigation into the origins of radiometer instabilities, and tests of new
              wideband heterodyne spectrometer architectures.
