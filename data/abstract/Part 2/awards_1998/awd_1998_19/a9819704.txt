Abstract    :
              The purpose of this one-year grant is to permit the PI and his research group to
              continue their work on:

i) Constitutive behavior of entangled polymers in
              fast steady sheer and
ii) In-situ fluorescence study of polymer adsorption and
              desorption with and without wall slip.

A second purpose is to permit the PI
              to absorb and to be able to respond to the criticisms that were generated in
              response to the larger scale proposed research plan that was initially
              proposed.

It is expected that the work associated with item (i) will move
              the investigator closer to an understanding of the phenomenon wherein the
              stress reaches a plateau in the presence of an increasing shear rate. 
              Similarly, the item (ii) objectives can be summarized as providing an enhanced
              understanding of the effect of surface conditions on the polymer flow behavior
              at the polymer/wall interface.  This study will include the effects of the
              associated molecular processes.
