Digital Government: Building Leadership for a Digital
              Government

The Council for Excellence in Government, in partnership with the
              Federal World-Wide Web Consortium, academics and industrial researchers, will
              design, develop and implement three actitivies to foster greater understanding
              of the value of the computer/information science research process and products
              in the Federal Government arena.  The three activities are:
1.  A Digital
              Government resource center
2.  Education and outreach programs, building on
              work by the Federal World-Wide Web Consortium, and
3.  Planning for the
              development of a curriculum for a Digital Government Fellows program.
