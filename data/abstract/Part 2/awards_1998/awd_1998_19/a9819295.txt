Abstract    :
              	In this project, the effect of nonlinear dynamics on the behavior of
              atmospheric chemical systems will be investigated. Specifically, the evolution
              of smoke from biomass combustion will be studied in collaboration with
              scientists performing measurements in forest fires. 
	Atmospheric chemistry
              models are based upon nonlinear governing differential equations. In such a
              system, autocatalytic growth or certain species is possible, with dramatic
              effects including instability and sensitivity of steady states, oscillations,
              and even chaos. The effects of this nonlinearity on the behavior of real
              atmospheres, as well as on the reliability of atmospheric models, are not
              well-understood. Powerful methods have been developed for the understanding and
              analysis of reactive chemical systems governed by nonlinear dynamic laws. These
              methods will be applied to very highly developed models of tropospheric
              chemistry. Initially, relatively small atmospheric chemistry models will be
              used, and later, the effects of adding model complexity will be investigated.
              
	This project is supported jointly by the EPSCoR, the Atmospheric Chemistry,
              and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Programs.
