This award to University of Delaware will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Henlopen, a
              research vessel operated by university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a fluorometer for studies of ocean chemistry and three sets
              of slip rings for operating instruments over conducting cable. The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly along the Middle Atlantic coast, in 1999 and future years.
