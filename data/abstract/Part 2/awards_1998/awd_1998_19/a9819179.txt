Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Josef Michl in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Colorado in Boulder.   The research aims to extend earlier work
              in three areas: 1) spin-orbit coupling and zero-field splitting in triplet
              biradicals, 2) wavelength dependent photochemical reactions of a hydrocarbon
              containing parallel benzene rings, and involving intersystem crossing, and 3)
              the synthesis of derivatives of [1.1.1]propellane.   Most of the work however
              will be devoted to the synthesis and properties of new alkylated and
              fluoroalkylated carborane anions and radicals.

The carborane compounds will
              be used to generate reactive intermediates, catalyze reactions with Li+ cation,
              oxidize very weak reducing agents, prepare unusual oxidation states of metals,
              and prepare magnetic and electrically conducting materials.   These may have
              applications in lithium batteries, fuel cell membranes, and catalysis of olefin
              polymerization.   Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students working
              with the PI will gain valuable experience in organic and metallo-organic
              chemistry, spectroscopy, computation, and materials science.
