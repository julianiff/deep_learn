Abstract: 
The PI's propose to
              develop a new type of sediment coring system with two important improvements:
              1) it will allow researchers to obtain real-time video of the bottom in order
              to precisely position a gravity corer, and 2) it will leave a core barrel in
              place at the site of the core that subsequently could be instrumented for
              longer term monitoring efforts.

The video system will be used to ensure
              proper emplacement of the corer, particularly if the target area is "less than
              a meter in width". The PI's hope to use this system in areas that have been
              extensively mapped prior to deployment of the coring system. The corer would
              then be able to obtain sediment from pre-selected sites of interest to the
              scientists and/or where long-term in-situ observations are important. The new
              system, called a "break-away corer", will be constructed so that the outer
              metal core barrel will break away from the weight stand. The empty core barrel
              will be left behind in the sediment when the weight stand and core liner with
              core samples is retrieved. With the empty core barrel effectively casing the
              core hole, scientists could subsequently use a submersible or an ROV to
              instrument and seal the core hole, creating an in-situ observatory similar to
              the CORK systems used in ODP holes.
