Abstract    :
              This project will use Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in conjunction with
              test particle tracing to examine the formation of the outer radiation belt. 
              The outer radiation belt is known to be formed during geomagnetic storms, but
              the detailed mechanisms by which electrons are energized to form the belt are
              very poorly understood.  MHD simulations will be used to determine the basic
              structure and time development of the magnetospheric electric and magnetic
              fields and at each time step, test particles will be followed to determine
              where and how they are energized.
