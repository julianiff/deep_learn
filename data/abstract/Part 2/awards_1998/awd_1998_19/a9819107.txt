This project in the area of Instructional Materials
              Development will develop a library of uniquely interactive web-based virtual
              manipulatives for mathematics in levels K-8.  The materials will be, for the
              most part, in the form of Java applets, and will be available free (via the
              internet).  They will also become a component of the electronic format version
              of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Principles and Standards
              for School Mathematics as well as link with other possible dissemination
              avenues.  While the materials are for children, they will also be useful for
              the mathematics background of both pre- and inservice K-8 teachers.  The
              Co-PI's feel that the virtual manipulatives will promote greater understanding
              of important mathematics concepts for children and link to the content
              understanding needs of their teachers.  In addition, the dissemination plans
              discussed above, the project materials will be available from either of two web
              sites to be used on-line or freely downloaded onto local networks or available
              via CD-ROM.
