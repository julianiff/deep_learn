This proposal will establish an environmental science
              institute to prepare leadership teams of middle school teachers.  Teachers will
              be engaged in authentic field study, will use technology for data collection
              and display, will review relevant instructional materials, and will work on
              developing a standards-based environmental program which will be integrated
              into their middle school curricula.  This four-year project will recruit
              teachers from midwestern states (IL, IN, IA, OH, WI, MI, and MN) to participate
              in pre-institute workshops, summer institutes, and academic year workshops. 
              Each year 20 teams of 4 individuals each will:  learn environmental science
              concepts and issues and inquiry skills for investigating the environment;
              enhance their curricular, pedagogical, and assessment knowledge and skills; and
              learn how to implement local professional development programs and
              partnerships.  The teachers' science content will be enhanced by field trips
              and training in computer usage.  Each team will develop a standards-based
              environmental science program and make presentations at national and state
              conventions.
