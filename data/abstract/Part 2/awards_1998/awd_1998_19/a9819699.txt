Abstract    :
              The investigators will characterize differences between solar wind conditions
              observed at the inner Lagrange point (L1), approximately 1.6 million kilometers
              sunward of the Earth and the conditions at Earth 30-60 minutes later when the
              "same" plasma arrives.   The approach is to expand on previous work in which
              they developed empirical relations for the probability that solar wind events
              at L1 appear in a similar form at Earth. The new effort is to incorporate
              magnetic field data to determine whether magnetic field conditions affect
              plasma correlations.
