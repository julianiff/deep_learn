Abstract    :

The PIs hypothesize that an abyssal gyre fills the western
              basin of the North Atlantic from the Equator to near 300 N, with the strongest
              recirculation located in the tropical Guiana Basin.  To date, measurements of
              the deep western boundary current portion of that flow show it to be so large
              as to upset the overall balance of the meridional overturning circulation. The
              hypothesized gyre is one mechanism, which, if shown to be of sufficient
              magnitude, would account for this discrepancy.  It has never been observed
              directly, and the PIs propose a field experiment to to so.  The study would
              focus on the narrow Guiana Basin between 80 N and 150 N.  Current meters and
              temperature sensors, supported by shipboard hydrography and ADCP measurements
              would be arrayed so as to directly determine the northward flow in this gyre.
