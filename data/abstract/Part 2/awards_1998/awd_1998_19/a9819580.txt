 This project is designed to use summer workshops to
              cross-train a cadre of 120 "core" teachers in different computer-based
              visualization tools for science and mathematics.  These teachers then give
              staff development workshops to introduce computer-based visualization to peers
              in their districts and local regions.  The project integrates a number of
              approaches previously supported by the National Science Foundation, including
              image processing, simulation and modeling, GIS, and molecular modeling.  The
              core teachers conduct short workshops (1-1/2 to 2 days each) for follow-on
              teachers in which they introduce one or more of these tools within the context
              of math and science courses.  The core teachers will conduct a total of 250
              such workshops.

The project provides extended electronic support for the
              local workshops, helping teachers to use various types of computer-based
              visualization tools with students to explore and discover math and science. 
              The project is designed for middle and high school math and science teachers in
              Virginia and the local region.  It aims to develop teachers' skills in using
              computer-based tools in order to help them and their students explore a rich
              array of content in their courses.

Cost sharing is 9% of the budget.
