EXPANDING THE COMMUNITY OF MATHEMATICS
              LEARNERS

Expanding the Community of Mathematics Learners is a five-year
              educational leadership project that partners six school districts in the
              Seattle, Washington area (Bellevue, Lake Washington, Mercer Island, Northshore,
              Seattle, and Shoreline) with the University of Washington's Departments of
              Mathematics and Statistics and College of Education.  The project expands the
              partners' common work with 600 middle and high school teachers of mathematics
              in the Local Systemic Change Project Creating a Community of Mathematics
              Learners to include elementary teachers.

The project develops a cadre of 300
              K-6 mathematics leaders in the six districts so that all elementary teachers
              may participate in the community of mathematics learners.  Working with project
              staff, 50 recognized leaders of mathematics education from the six districts
              prepare 250 emerging leaders to facilitate Developing Mathematical Ideas (DMI)
              sessions for approximately 2500 elementary teachers.  Though the Developing
              Mathematical Ideas (DMI) professional development materials form the
              cornerstone of the experiences for the mathematics leaders, the following
              additional components prepare them for work with their peers:  (1) facilitation
              skills, (2) mathematical content, (3) exemplary instructional materials, (4)
              electronic networking, and (5) leadership for school change.

The project's
              implementation structure emphasizes efficiency and economy of scale.  The 50
              district mathematics leaders and 250 building mathematics leaders each receive
              over 250 hours of professional development over the life of the project. 
              Building leaders in turn provide at least 60 hours of staff development for
              approximately 2500 teachers in the participating districts. 

Auditable cost
              sharing, derived from the University of Washington and participating districts,
              is over $ 327,000.  Other commitments and "informal cost-sharing" from the
              districts is expected to exceed $ 7.2 million.
