"Studies of Supernovae and Supernova
              Remnants"
AST-9819825

This is an international collaborative program to
              observe low-redshift supernovae (SNe) in a coordinated attempt to improve the
              precision with which such objects can be used as cosmological distance
              indicators.  This program includes not only supernova of type SNe Ia, but also
              several types of supernovae that are not used as standard candles, so that the
              classification system can be improved.  A key goal in the new effort centers on
              improving the characterization of supernova evolution in the near-ultraviolet,
              which is redshifted into the optical red spectral region for high redshift (Z ~
              1) SNe Ia seen near the limit of current searches.  The latter refinement is
              particularly important to current cosmological studies.  Much of the
              observational effort will be performed at the MMT, which is likely to become
              available in 2000.  This effort includes a collaboration with Australian
              researchers to improve the southern hemisphere sky coverage, detection, and
              follow-up of supernova events.

This project is co-funded by the NSF AST
              Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics program and the NSF INT East Asian and South
              Pacific program.
