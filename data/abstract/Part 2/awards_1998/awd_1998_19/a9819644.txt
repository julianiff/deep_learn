This five-year Local Systemic Change in Science, 6-12 project
              requests $1,012,463 for providing a minimum of 130 hours of professional
              development for all 225 teachers of science in the 17 school districts
              represented in the service district of Stark County, Ohio.  The project will
              develop a clearly articulated and sequenced science curriculum for grades 7-12.
               It will identify and implement exemplary instructional materials and create a
              leadership team in every district.  It will also educate all middle-school and
              high-school science teachers in coursework related to the national science
              education standards.  Finally, it sets as one of its main objectives the
              increase of student achievement in science as measured by science tests in
              grades 9,12 and the upcoming grade 10 test.
