This three year project  requests $716,228 for the purpose of
              providing materials development for  a series of nine graduate
              chemistry-content-oriented modular courses for already science-certified
              teachers.  The project is aimed primarily at those teachers who are new to
              teaching chemistry.  The materials will focus on those content and pedagogy
              topics likely to provide them with very deep understanding of chemistry and
              related science and mathematics content in the curricula they currently teach. 
              Assessment of teacher knowledge serves as the core of these materials and will
              be delivered using the World Wide Web.  Immediately upon submission of
              responses, teachers will receive feedback -- detailed, computer-calculated
              tutoring in the case of computer-graded responses, and model answers or keys
              for responses that are to be 'hand' graded. The materials will be made
              available widely throughout the US through traditional licensing arrangements
              to non-partner schools.  A low cost service for delivering the materials to
              teachers enrolled in academic programs throughout the US will be established. 
              All of the materials will be publicly available over the WWW. There are over 30
              participating institutions.  The project is expected to serve at least 270
              teachers, each receiving 18 credit hours( over 270 hours) towards a masters
              degree.  The project is expected to run through 2002.
