Abstract    :
              Laser induced thermal desorption coupled with Fourier transform mass
              spectrometry is used as a probe of surface reaction kinetics in this project
              carried out with support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. 
              Professor John Hemminger of the University of California, Irvine and his
              coworkers are using this method to address questions of hydrocarbon surface
              reaction kinetics and mechanisms.  In particular, the effect of high
              concentrations of coadsorbed hydrogen on the initial C-H bond breaking step in
              the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on Pt(111) is being explored.  In addition,
              information about reactant overlayer configuration, and ensemble effects in
              hydrocarbon reactions on the platinum surface, is being obtained.  This
              fundamental information provides a mechanistic understanding for important
              heterogeneous catalytic reactions. 

Desorption of reaction intermediates,
              followed by mass spectral identification of these species, is used to develop
              an understanding of surface reaction mechanisms in this project.  The important
              reactions of hydrocarbons on well characterized platinum surfaces are the focus
              of this work, which provides fundamental understanding of catalytic reactions
              central to the chemical and energy production industries.  The unique
              experimental capability in the Principal Investigator's laboratory allows a
              detailed description of the mechanisms and rates of these important
              reactions.
