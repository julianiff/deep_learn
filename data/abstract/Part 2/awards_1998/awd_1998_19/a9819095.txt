Abstract    :
              Spatial patterns and processes characterizing geographical entities and
              phenomena, such as drainage basins, systems of cities, and flows of
              information, often show a remarkable mix of organization and complexity.  These
              arise from a large number of interactions that are spatially distributed and
              characterized by non-linear processes involving stochastic effects and
              instabilities.  The dominant objective of this research is to refine and extend
              a family of physically based models for simulating key aspects of drainage
              basin evolution. The project will incorporate theoretical, computational, and
              field-based investigations to accomplish the following:  (1) apply emerging
              methodologies for characterizing the qualitative behavior of
              infinite-dimensional, non-linear dynamical systems in explaining the emergence
              of spatial patterns in the evolution of drainage basins; (2) demonstrate that
              such methods must be used in conjunction with traditional methods in developing
              a full characterization of the evolution of fluvial land surfaces and an
              understanding of various scaling laws; (3) develop additional tools for such
              analyses and apply them to other examples of complex geographic phenomena; and
              (4) disseminate an understanding of these methods and their value.  The
              mathematical and modeling results will provide a basis for qualitative and
              quantitative predictions that may be compared with observations on real
              landscapes, and ultimately, models of analogous geographic phenomena, such as
              population movements, diffusion of innovations, and information flows can be
              developed based on this understanding.
