The investigators will deploy five Global
              Positioning System (GPS) receivers in South America to observe the day-to-day
              variability of the equatorial ionosphere.  They will use the data to study the
              background ionospheric conditions leading to the development of equatorial
              spread F (ESF).  The goal is to understand the combined action of the number
              density, plasma drifts, neutral winds, and electric fields in relation to
              irregularity formation.  The five receivers will add to an existing network of
              12, providing an unprecedented latitudinal range for observing equatorial
              plasma phenomena.  The measurement of total electron content provided by the
              receivers will be used to determine the vertical profiles of electron density
              using tomographic inversion techniques.  To interpret the data, the
              investigators will develop a theoretical model of the low latitude ionosphere
              whose output can be compared with the measurements.  This combination of model
              and measurements will be applied to events covering different seasons, magnetic
              conditions, and solar activity levels.  The results will be used to improve
              Space Weather forecasts of the mid-latitude ionosphere to reduce the impact on
              navigation and communication systems resulting from ionospheric
              irregularities.
