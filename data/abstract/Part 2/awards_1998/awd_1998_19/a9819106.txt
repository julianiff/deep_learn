ChemViz is a set of scientific visualization tools and
              instructional materials designed to make computational chemistry accessible to
              high school and college students and teachers.  It includes Waltz, a web based
              interface to a computational program that calculates electron densities and
              molecular orbitals, through which students can design experiments to answer
              questions about atoms, molecules and chemical bonding.  Another web-based tool
              allows interfaces with databases of crystallographic structures that provide 3D
              models of molecules.  ChemViz II improves and updates existing tools, develops
              additional visualization tools for chemical processes, develops, tests and
              disseminates instructional materials accompanying the tools, and integrates the
              tools and materials into a collaborative learning environment.  The interactive
              simulations under student control bridge the gap between laboratory experiments
              conducted by the student and abstract concepts.  The materials, developed and
              tested with teachers, consist of forty (40)  one-hour-long activities.  Teacher
              materials are provided.  An extensive formative and summative evaluation
              provides guidance to the development and measures student
              achievement.
