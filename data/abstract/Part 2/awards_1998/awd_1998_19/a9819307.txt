Abstract    :
              	In the larger debate about how political institutions affect fiscal and
              economic performance, attention has returned recently to electoral systems.  It
              now appears that proportional systems minimize distortions in one class of
              democracies (wealthy, small, open economies with weak political competition),
              while majoritarian systems do so in another class (larger, poorer, or more
              contentious democracies); but we lack an explanation for this observed
              regularity.
	In two recent papers, the principal investigator develops and
              begins to test a model of distortionary vote buying in which majoritarian
              voting systems minimize social cost where votes are cheap (easily bought), but
              proportional representation (PR) does so where votes are dear (hard to buy). 
              This accounts plausibly for the observed regularity; but other testable
              implications arise from the model (and were not anticipated in its
              construction); for example, (a) total social cost rises monotonically as votes
              grow cheaper under PR, but first rises and then declines under majoritarian
              systems, and (b) the economically "worst" outcome under PR is considerably
              worse than the worst under any majoritarian system.
	The current model is a
              very simple one of interaction between incumbents and voters, and tests of it
              to date have been cross-sectional and have involved only a few indicators.  In
              future research, it is proposed:  (a) to model party competition explicitly;
              and (b) to test on a much broader array of indicators (some of which are
              constructed laboriously) and on time-series data for all democratic regimes
              from 1960 to the present.
