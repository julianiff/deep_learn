This award provides
              support to complete the development of a long-baseline interferometric array
              imaging system for high angular resolution astronomy in the 10-micron (thermal
              infrared) region of the spectrum.  A third telescope will be added to the
              already-functioning Berkeley interferometer.  The local oscillator system will
              also be upgraded to provide for a central laser source.  Both the number of
              possible positions for the telescopes and the available baseline lengths will
              be increased to improve the image resolution and spatial sampling on the sky.
