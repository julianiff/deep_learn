Abstract    :
              The recent resurgence of immigrants to the United States has raised concerns
              over their lower educational and skill levels and their disproportional use of
              public assistance. Important issues related to the disproportional use of
              public assistance among immigrants include the impact of public program
              participation on private support and productive activities, and, ultimately, on
              the adaptation of immigrants. The project integrates human capital theory and
              social capital theory, with special attention to the application of social
              capital theory in immigration. By introducing the concept of social capital in
              the economic models, we develop three alternative hypotheses to be tested in
              the proposed study. (1) Greater social capital reduces the degree to which
              public assistance displaces private support. (2) Greater social capital
              decreases the work disincentives of public assistance. (3) Public assistance
              has a positive effect on the adaptation of immigrants, conditional on strong
              social capital and low costs of public assistance. The analysis will use two
              recent panels (1992 and 1993) of the Survey of Income and Program Participation
              (SIPP), which together provide a sufficient, nationally representative sample
              of recent immigrants (about 5,000 individual immigrants over age 15). Using
              rigorous panel data analysis techniques, the proposed research will advance our
              knowledge of the relationship between public assistance and private support as
              well as the consequences of public assistance for immigrants. It will also
              provide information for policy makers and the public in the continuous heated
              debate over immigration.
