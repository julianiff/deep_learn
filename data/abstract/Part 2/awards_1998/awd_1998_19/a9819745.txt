Abstract    :
              Continued support is requested for operation of the Escherichia coli Genetic
              Stock Center.  The Center maintains a collection of over 7,500 mutant
              derivatives of E. coli strain K-12, and has distributed approximately 17,500
              certified genetically pure cultures over the last five years.  Recipient
              investigators and teachers work in such diverse fields as microbial genetics,
              molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, genome sequencing, biophysics,
              medical research and pharmacology.  Users are found in academia, non-profit
              research institutes, and government and industrial laboratories.  The Center
              also serves as an information resource on genotypes of mutant derivatives of E.
              coli and on function and genetic mapping of E. coli genes.  It continues to
              coordinate assignment of gene symbols and to encourage adherence to the
              accepted genetic nomenclature.  Extensive information is made freely available
              on the Center's Web site
