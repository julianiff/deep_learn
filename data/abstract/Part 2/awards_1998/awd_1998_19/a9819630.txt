This Teacher Enhancement project is a 36-month Teacher
              Leadership Project, involving teachers in grades 4-8 of the Pacific region. 
              The region encompasses American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern
              Marinas, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Hawaii, the Republic of the
              Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.  The DELTA Cadre consists of 8
              entity-local teams.  Teams include the entity's mathematics curriculum
              specialist, college mathematics and mathematics education faculty members, and
              a master teacher.  Project activities include a three-week Cadre Training
              Institute to deepen members' mathematical and pedagogical knowledge in
              number/algebra, geometry/measurement, and probability/statistics.  An
              additional five days will be devoted to the review of standards-based
              curricular materials in mathematics.

The objectives of the project include: 
              improving cadre members' mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge; their
              understanding of the change process related to the implementation of
              standards-based curriculum; and their ability to develop and implement
              research-based models of exemplary professional development materials tailored
              to the needs of teachers in grades 4-8.
