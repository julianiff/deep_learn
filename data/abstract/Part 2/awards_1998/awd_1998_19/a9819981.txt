Abstract    :
                 The retina of the eye is the tissue that contains the photoreceptor cells and
              a complex network of other nerve cells, or neurons.  This network has to work
              properly over a huge range of light intensity, between the brightest daylight
              and the darkest night.  Recent studies have suggested circadian, or daily,
              rhythmic changes in many bodily functions, driven by 'biological clocks' that
              may involve network properties or oscillating biochemical activity in single
              cells.  This study uses the goldfish retina as a model of a complex circuit to
              explore how changes in chemistry and biochemical factors can regulate the light
              sensitivity of cells in the retina.  Electrophysiological and pharmacological
              tools will be used to examine how local biochemistry affects circadian
              activity, in a novel approach using single cells in the retina to test
              hypotheses about cellular mechanisms for this regulation.
   Results will
              extend beyond visual neuroscience to have an impact on understanding regulation
              of neural circuits in general, and neurochemical modulation in general; better
              understanding of circadian rhythms could lead to possible future benefits to
              society including handling circadian aspects of shift-work and jet lag.
