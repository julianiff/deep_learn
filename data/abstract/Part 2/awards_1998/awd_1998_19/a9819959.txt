Abstract    :
              This oceanographic instrumentation development project will construct a relative
              gravity meter system capable of high precision measurements on the seafloor,
              and be deployable on a large suite of remotely operated vehicles (ROV's) and
              submersibles.  Gravity measurements of the seafloor can be used to detect
              vertical deformation and mass redistribution within a network of observation
              stations.  These measurements will contribute to our understanding of plate
              tectonics, seafloor strain accumulation and strain patterns. Substantial cost
              sharing is being provided.
