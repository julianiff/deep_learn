"Spectral Classification of Hot
              Subdwarfs"
AST-9819835

A system for classifying the spectra of rare but
              astrophysically important hot stars called subdwarfs has been developed.  Such
              luminous stars are important clues to stellar evolution and provide valuable
              distance and age indices for studies of star clusters in the Galaxy.  It has
              been found that three parameters are necessary to uniquely classify such stars:
              temperature, luminosity and "helium abundance."  This project will refine and
              complete the basic system of classification.  Particular attention will be paid
              to what appears to be two "parallel spectral sequences" that depend upon
              whether a star exhibits strong lines of carbon (CII, CIII or CIV), that are
              thought to be an index for He abundance.  A calibration of the new spectral
              types with effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, photometric
              color and helium abundance will be derived and an attempt will be made to draw
              connections between these spectral types and the groups of hot subdwarfs
              identified during the Palomar-Green survey.
