              ABSTRACT

Elitzur, Moshe
AST-9819368

The high-resolution data now
              obtainable from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio facility and
              wide-field data from the Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Infra-red
              Space Observatory (ISO) have provided a wealth of new information on naturally
              occurring maser processes.  The extended atmospheres of both young and dying
              stars, the expanding debris of supernova remnants, and the large star-forming
              regions in other galaxies are all much brighter in the infrared and microwave
              region than their physical temperatures would imply, suggesting that maser
              activity is occurring.  Molecules such as H20, OH and SiO are energetically
              'pumped' by the IR radiation emitted by hot dust or, in some cases, by direct
              collisions with neutral 'wind' particles.  Such species release this energy in
              the form of specific well-collimated long-wavelength photons.  These are
              crucial processes to understand, since a large fraction of most stars' mass is
              returned to the interstellar medium under such conditions.  This grant supports
              a theoretical study of a broad variety of astronomical maser sources.  The
              computed models will take into account the photon radiation and hydrodynamic
              pressure, accelerations and heating of dust.  The goal is to achieve a good
              agreement between observations and models by including thermal energy balance
              computations into the existing code.
