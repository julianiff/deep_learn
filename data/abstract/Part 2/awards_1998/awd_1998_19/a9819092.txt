Abstract    :
              	This award provides support for a continuing collaboration between Dr. Plumb
              and Dr. Polvani at Columbia University (ATM-9818656).

	Their previous work
              was focused on various nonlinear aspects of atmospheric dynamics, especially,
              but not only, of planetary scale Rossby wave, and their interaction with the
              background circulation.  Those studies relied heavily on the use of models -
              both high-resolution two-dimensional (one-layer) models and three-dimensional,
              global models - and fluid dynamics theory.

	Under this award the principal
              investigators will restrict their work to stratospheric dynamics.  Despite
              considerable progress in this area over the past two decades, several key
              issues remained incompletely answered.  The issues to be investigated are:  (1)
              how the seasonal evolution of the winter stratosphere and the timing of the
              springtime final warming depend on the imposed wave climatology;  (2) what
              determines the location of the subtropical "transport barrier", bounding the
              midlatitude surf zone;  (3) how the surf zone and the induced meridional
              circulation interact; and (4) whether dynamical systems theory can offer an
              objective approach to the quantification of isentropic transport processes. 
              The principal investigators will tackle these problems using a combination of
              theory and several different models.
