Abstract    :
              The investigators seek to discover the evolutionary sequence of events leading
              to the initiation of coronal mass ejections (CME) occurring on the solar disk,
              guided by what has been learned about mass ejections from the solar limb.  This
              is of basic importance to Space Weather, as the coronal mass ejections
              producing geomagnetic storms occur primarily on the disk of the sun, whereas
              those occurring on the limb are more easily observed due to the dark
              background. The main effort is to define signatures of disk coronal mass
              ejections in ground based data, specifically full disk images of the neutral
              helium absorption line at 1083nm, based on detailed comparison with other
              ground based observations supplemented by ultraviolet and x-ray images obtained
              from spacecraft.
