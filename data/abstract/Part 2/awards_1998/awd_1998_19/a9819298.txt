This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring 3 global positioning satellite (GPS) receivers which will be
              monumented and operated quasi-continuously in Morocco, North Africa.  In
              addition to these receivers, 26 additional receivers will be operated in
              campaign mode as part of a kinematic study of the motions across the
              African-Iberian plate boundary in the western Mediterranean that is being
              funded by the Earth Sciences Geophysics Program (EAR-9814964).  Reilinger's
              campaign style GPS monitoring of plate motions in Turkey and the Caucasus has
              ground-truthed the kinematics of this complex region which had
 previously
              only been inferred based on seismology and field mapping. GPS data from the
              western Mediterranean are needed to constrain the overall picture of plate
              tectonic motions throughout the Mediterranean region and Reilinger's extensive
              field experience in the often physically and politically challenging environs
              in this region makes him aptly qualified for the job.  The equipment acquired
              through this grant together with research funding from the Geophysics program,
              will facilitate a logical extension of Reilinger's past 10 years of research in
              this region.  Reilinger has teamed up with researchers from Cornell University
              and international collaborators from Spain, Portugal and Morocco.  Indeed, the
              Moroccans will be maintaining and operating the requested GPS receivers which
              will be operating quasi-continuously.  As a result, Reilinger has brokered
              considerable cost savings in terms of man power in seeing this project to
              completion and in exchange, NSF is providing an infrastructural technology
              transfer that is both scientifically and politically appealing.
