Abstract    :
              This project will study melt variations through the lower crust and Moho of the
              9 degree north segment of the East Pacific Rise using 24 seafloor compliance
              measurements.  The goals are to determine the variation of melt within the
              crust and upper mantle along a fast spreading ridge, to determine the scales of
              the variation and whether these variations correlate to morphological
              variations.
