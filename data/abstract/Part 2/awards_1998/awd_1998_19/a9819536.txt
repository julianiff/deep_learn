Abstract    :
              9819536 Lee
A large coordinated experiment (HOME: Hawaiian Ocean Mixing
              Experiment) near the Hawaiian Ridge is underway to determine whether sites with
              rough topography are responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals
              are to identify the major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an
              approximate energy budget for the region. This project is part of the
              near-field experiment of the HOME project that focuses on the investigation of
              the dynamical processes in the immediate vicinity of the Hawaiian Ridge, and
              especially the response to barotropic tidal forcing including generation  of
              low- and high-mode internal waves, propagation and turbulent dissipation and
              mixing. This sub-project will focus on understanding the mechanisms responsible
              for generating both low- and high-mode internal tides that radiate energy away
              from the Ridge and high wavenumber internal waves which dissipate nearer the
              generation region. Full-depth (including the bottom boundary layer) velocity,
              density and microstructure profiles will be collected to estimate energy flux,
              flux divergence and dissipation. Synoptic survey to sample across and along
              Ridge response will repeated every 2.5 hour for a period of at least 13 hours
              using XCPs. An extended occupation station (30+ hours) will investigate the
              contributions of non-tidal inertial motions.
