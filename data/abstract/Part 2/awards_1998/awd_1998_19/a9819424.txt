"Science Standards with Integrative Marine Science" (SSWIMS)
              will expand upon the successful "Leadership in Marine Science" (LIMS)program by
              providing a content-rich experience for teachers that will empower them to
              function as leaders.  SSWIMS will reach twice as many teachers as LIMS and will
              serve all 51 public school districts (and private schools) in Los Angeles
              County.  Marine science will be the theme for an integrative science program
              that provides teachers with instruction in university-level science content and
              training in grade-appropriate, hands-on classroom and laboratory activities. 
              Content will be structured to incorporate both the National and the California
              Science Education Standards.  Over the course of four years, SSWIMS will train
              320 teachers (grades 5-12) who teach approximately 105,600 students.  It is
              expected  the 320 teachers will in turn train an additional 2,400 teachers
              (through in-service), expanding the number of students affected by another
              316,800.  Each year, 80 teachers will participate in a 3-day field trip to
              Catalina Island where they will learn marine science using shore-based
              facilities and onboard a research vessel; they will enroll in a marine science
              class on the UCLA campus during the school year, with lecture and laboratory
              components; and they will participate in a final 3-day workshop/retreat to
              discuss the impact of SSWIMS on their classroom. There is a great deal of
              technical and professional development support that will be available
              throughout the school year.  Teachers receive quarter units for science and
              professional development for participating.
