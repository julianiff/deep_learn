This award provides funds to support a 12-month research visit
              by Dr. Mukul R. Kundu, Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, for
              collaboration with Dr. Takashi Sakurai and other scientists in the Solar
              Physics Division, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.  This research
              will provide access of the visitor to the excellent data collected by several
              Japanese telescopes, namely the soft X-ray and hard X-ray telescopes on the
              Yohkoh satellite and the Nobeyama radioheliograph operating at 17 and 34 GHz. 
              Together with other pertinent ground-based or space-based data, these data sets
              will be used for studies of the solar corona.  In this collaboration, the U.S.
              visitor will provide his expertise in solar coronal research while the Japanese
              scientists will provide theoretical expertise in computing extrapolated coronal
              magnetic fields for sunspot atmosphere modeling, as well as expertise in
              accessing Yohkoh X-ray data and ground based optical data.

The specific
              activities designed to take advantage of the Japanese data cover a broad range
              of coronal phenomena, including (1) X-ray emission above sunspot umbrae; (2)
              radio emission associated with coronal X-ray jets; (3) the evolution of active
              regions in terms of flare productivity; (4) millimeter and microwave
              brightening observed in the polar coronal holes; and (5) the microwave and
              meterwave counterparts of the erupting polar coronal plumes.  The project will
              be mutually beneficial because of the complementary expertise of the
              collaborators which will contribute to the two-way exchanges of ideas, skills,
              and techniques planned for this research.  This project is supported under the
              Science Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation and the
              Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.
