This project will undertake the task
              of modeling the formation, modification and survival of dust in the supernova
              environment.  Its goal is to determine the processes which yield the isotopic
              abundances observed in pre-Solar grains.  A large interdisciplinary team has
              been assembled to address each part of the overall problem, from the physics of
              the initial explosion, nucleosynthesis, condensation mechanisms, and decay
              rates.  The work at Clemson will focus on computing detailed models of the
              isotopic abundances of massive stars that are the progenitors of supernovae. 
              Isotopic abundance, temperature, density and pressure histories of the various
              composition zones will be modeled for the expanding supernova shell, followed
              by a chemical equilibrium analysis of the modes by which condensation can occur
              in the cooling material.
