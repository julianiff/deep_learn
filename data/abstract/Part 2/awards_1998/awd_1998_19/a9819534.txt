Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated
              experiment, the Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME), near the Hawaiian
              Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are responsible for the
              mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the major energy pathways
              for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget for the region. An
              array of four High Frequency radars will be deployed on the west coast of Oahu
              and on the east coast of Kauai to study the current fields over the area of the
              HOME nearfield current meter array and the tidal propagation region south of
              the submerged Kaena ridge.  The current measurements will be separated into a
              low-frequency mesoscale component, a mean flow, and spectrally separable tidal
              constituents. With the aid of high resolution bathymetry, an attempt will be
              made to separate the baroclinic and the barotropic components of the major
              constituents, and compare them with a decomposition based on their coherence
              with the astronomical forcing. Near-surface ADCP data from the nearfield
              moorings will be used to assess the quality of the radar data.
