This award is for a year of planning activity for the
              development of a five-year Local Systemic Change (LSC) project involving 972
              K-8 teachers in the Lexington, Kentucky area.  The LASER-M/S project is a
              partnership between the Fayette County Public School District and the
              University of Kentucky.  The planning will include the development of
              professional development opportunities for teachers in mathematics and science
              using the following NSF-supported programs:  Investigations in Number, Data,
              and Space; the Full Option Science System(FOSS); Science Curriculum Improvement
              Study; and Science Education for Public Education Program (SEPUP).  Support for
              this planning will include consultants working with project staff from the
              University of Kentucky and the Education Development Center.  The planning
              effort will also allow for the development of pilot sites that will later serve
              as models for other schools.  Finally, project staff will gather, develop, and
              field-test instruments that assess teachers' understanding of mathematics and
              science, their attitudes toward mathematics and science, their teaching
              effectiveness, and their students' learning of mathematics and science.  These
              instruments will later be used in the systemic initiative.
