Abstract    :
              This research program will examine the role played by linear as well as
              non-linear wave phenomena in coupling energy flow between the magnetosphere and
              the ionosphere.  A 3-dimensional 2-fluid code will be used in the simulation
              studies.  Four specific tasks are outlined for the research: (1) A study of
              inertial Alfven waves and the role they play in ion heating, (2) the role
              played by the Inhomogeneous Energy density Driven instability plays in coupling
              Solitary-Alfven Structures to ion heating, (3) the formation and stability of
              inertial Alfven Resonance Cones, and (4) the formation and non-linear evolution
              of density cavities.
