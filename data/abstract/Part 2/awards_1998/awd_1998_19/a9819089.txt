              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819089

In recent years, significant evidence has accumulated
              suggesting that the geochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter in
              marine waters is mediated in large measure by light and trace metal catalysis. 
              In this project the principal investigator will conduct a comprehensive study
              of the kinetics of photooxidation of chromophoric (i.e., colored) dissolved
              organic matter (CDOM) in coastal waters.  Laboratory studies will be conducted
              in the presence and absence of various radical scavengers and oxygen and
              interpreted using kinetic modeling.  To study the involvement of  hydroxide
              radical, hydroxide would be generated chemically or radiolytically in the
              absence of light.  The specific topics that will be addressed include:  (1) the
              importance of Fe in CDOM photooxidation, photobleaching and product formation
              in seawater; (2) the photomechanism of CDOM bleaching in the absence of Fe; and
              (3) the mechanisms of Fe-CDOM interactions.
