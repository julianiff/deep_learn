This pilot project will develop a nationwide educational
              leadership program to introduce exemplary physical and space science curricula,
              Astronomy Resources for Intercurricula Elementary Science (ARIES) (grades 3-6)
              and Astronomy Village (Grades 8/9) into schools.  To meet this goal 10 teacher
              enhancement sites, chosen from the existing consortium of Challenger Learning
              centers will be networked around the nation.  A Mentor Team consisting of a
              flight director and a classroom teacher will be recruited from each
              participating center.  The Teams will attend two-week institutes at the Science
              Education Department, at Harvard University (SED) and the McAuliffe Challenger
              Center (MCC) in 1999 and 2000 in order to prepare them to lead workshops and
              academic focus meetings for teachers grades 3-8 at their own centers.  The
              program will be focussed for teacher's adopting SEDNet's exemplary science
              materials, Project ARIES and Astronomy Village. The two-year pilot program will
              target elementary and middle-school teachers.
