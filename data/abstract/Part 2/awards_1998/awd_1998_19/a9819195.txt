Abstract    :
              The PIs will test the hypothesis of simple shear of extension and the "upper
              plate paradox" through a mass-balance analysis exercise across two conjugate
              margins.  South China Sea has well-defined conjugate margins with well known
              spreading history and a network of seismic data and wells.  They will analyze
              the South China Sea margin and describe the deformation on matching
              across-margin profiles of the conjugate Palawan margin.  They will study the
              sediment-loaded subsidence rate of the pre-rift basement from well-log data and
              the degree of crustal extension from MCS sections across the margins.  Forward
              modeling of basin formation will identify whether the observed amounts of
              subsidence are compatible with uniform extension models.
