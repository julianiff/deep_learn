This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Alpha Helix, a
              research vessel operated by the university's Seward Marine Center as part of
              the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a replacement for their
              MOCNESS sampling system, sensors for use with their CTD
              (conductivity-temperature-depth) instrument, a carousel and sample bottles for
              sampling sea water, and computer and network components to upgrade the
              shipboard computer environment. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in the Gulf of
              Alaska and Bering Sea, in 1999 and future years.
