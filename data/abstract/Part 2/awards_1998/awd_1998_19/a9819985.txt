Abstract    :
              
Dr. Hermanson will study the relationship between muscle architecture and its
              functional role in mammalian running.  When muscles shorten more than one/third
              of their length, the chemical cross-bridges that control muscle length cease to
              overlap and thus cease to generate force.  He will test a primary hypothesis
              that short-fibered muscles are active during high-speed gaits and that they
              function as elastic energy storage structures during locomotion.  The study is
              unique in that it focuses on pairs of well-studied muscles in horses that have
              been well characterized for their role in passive stay apparatus.  This
              research will provide new perspective into the design of normal mammalian
              muscle in a system (equine) that is of importance and also provides fundamental
              insight into issues of muscle design.
