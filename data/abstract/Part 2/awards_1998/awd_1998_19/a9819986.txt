Abstract    :
              The 41st Maize Genetics meeting will be held March 11-14, 1999.  The meeting
              offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and
              discuss their most recent research results.  A wide range of topics are
              covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The 41st Annual meeting
              will feature 45 minute talks by four invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by
              individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.  The invited
              speakers will be:  Susan Wessler, University of Georgia; Richard Jorgensen,
              University of Arizona; Patrick Schnable, Iowa State University; and Susan
              McCouch, Cornell University.  The workshops will focus on two timely subjects: 
              Genomic Approaches for Maize and Cereal Research and Technology Transfer and
              Licensing.

The Maize Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity
              for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to
              discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the
              scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.
