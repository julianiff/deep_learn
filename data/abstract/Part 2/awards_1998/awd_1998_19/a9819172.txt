The proposed research will examine the role of microbial
              influences on metal cycling in four stratified lakes in the McMurdo Dry
              Valleys:  Lake Fryxell, Hoare, Joyce and Miers.  These lakes are characterized
              by unusually stable redox transition zones and are especially amenable to a
              finely spaced sampling regime.  Collectively, they represent a broad range of
              water chemistries.  The proposed research will test the following hypotheses: 
              (1) Instratified water columns there will be a clear spatial difference between
              the onset of manganese reduction and the onset of iron reduction.  Heavy metals
              and rare earth elements will be seen to undergo co-cycling with manganese
              rather than with iron.  (2) In all four lakes, manganese reduction will be
              associated with the presence of carnobacteria or with other manganese-reducing
              organisms.  In brief, the study will explore the link between microbial
              activity and the cycling and fate of a large suite of chemical elements at key
              redox boundaries.  Dissolved and particulate metal profiles will be examined as
              a function of depth from the ice-water interface to the sediments.  Profiles
              will be correlated with microbial manganese-reduction assays and the presence
              of manganese reducers as detected by screening with Mn-oxide overlay agar
              plates and nucleic acid hybridizations with probes for known manganese
              reducers.  The research will include significant involvement of
              undergraduates.
