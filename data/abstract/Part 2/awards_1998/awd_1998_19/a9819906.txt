Abstract    :
              This project will develop the computer architecture for the Community
              Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).  The development of a computer architecture
              (or 'spine') that will facilitate the inter-communication of different Space
              Weather models is critical to the success of the CCMC.  The approach that will
              be developed by this project involves a control program that will manage
              execution of the integrated system, a toolbox of common reusable software
              applications such as data visualization modules and coordinate transforms, an
              integrated set of standard system services and communication protocols, and a
              graphical user interface (GUI).  The system will be designed to facilitate
              communications between the CCMC front end located at Goddard Space Flight
              Center and the cluster of IBM SP2 nodes that forms the computational basis of
              the CCMC
