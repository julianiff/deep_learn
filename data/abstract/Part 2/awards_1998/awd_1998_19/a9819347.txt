Abstract    :
              This proposal is intended to address student achievement and systemic reform in
              science and math education.  It approaches the challenge from the unique
              perspectives of rural communities.  The project will help math and science
              educators build upon the inherent strengths of rural schools and better
              understand the factors inherent in rural schools and communities that support
              or serve as barriers to systemic reform.  This study has four objectives:
1.
              To develop a system of indicators around each of the identifies six drivers of
              educational system reform.
2. To determine the perceived relative importance
              and value of each of the drivers and indicators for reform in RSI schools in
              selected communities.
3. To determine the status of innovation/reform within
              selected communities with respect to factors through to support or serve as
              barriers to innovation and education reform.
To determine the ways and the
              extent to which the perceived importance and value of the drivers and the
              characteristics of the community impact on systemic reform efforts and student
              achievement in mathematics, science and technology.
