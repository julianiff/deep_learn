              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819007


Characterizing the chemistry of carbon dioxide and
              its various inorganic forms in seawater is essential to understanding the role
              played by the ocean in the sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide and the
              regulation of global climate.  To achieve global coverage of carbon dioxide
              measurements in the sea, scientists and laboratories around the world must
              cooperate and share data with one another.  Nevertheless, this would be a
              meaningless exercise without some assurance that each laboratory is capable of
              accurate and precise measurement of seawater carbon dioxide.  In this project,
              the principal investigator proposes to continue his program of producing,
              certifying, and distributing to the international community a standard
              reference material for carbon dioxide in seawater.  The parameters of the
              seawater CO2 system that will be certified include total dissolved inorganic
              carbon (TIC), total alkalinity (TA), hydrogen ion concentration (pH), and the
              carbon isotopic composition.  The objective is to assure intercomparability of
              oceanic CO2 measurements around the world.
