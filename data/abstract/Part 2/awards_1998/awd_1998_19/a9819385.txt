Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. Jim Ibers, Department of
              Chemistry, Northwestern University, in which the main objective is the further
              development of a new area of chemistry still in its embryonic stage, namely
              soluble metal selenides and metal tellurides. The studies may provide new and
              unusual compounds with unusual reactivities.

The resulting compounds from
              this research, if they behave like the metal-sulfur compounds, may show unusual
              properties with potential technological significance. Graduate students and
              associates will gain invaluable experience in preparative skills, in solid
              state chemistry, and in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
