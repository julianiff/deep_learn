Paczynski, Bohdan
"Collaborative Project: Distances and Ages from
              Detached Eclipsing Binary Stars"
AST-9819787

This is a multi-pronged
              collaborative investigation of newly discovered eclipsing binary stars with Ian
              Thompson at Carnegie Institute of Washington (AST-9819786).  The goal is to
              provide distance determinations, compositions and ages for stars in globular
              clusters and the Magellanic Clouds found during the course of the Optical
              Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE).  An extensive observational effort
              will be undertaken to obtain photometric and spectroscopic observations of OGLE
              binaries from which distances, masses and radii can be determined using
              standard techniques.  These measurements, made for an unprecedented large
              number of binaries, will provide firm tests of stellar evolution theory,
              further constrain globular cluster ages, and thus contribute improved minimum
              age estimates for the Galaxy and Universe at large.
