The American Meteorological Society, with the assistance of the
              United States Naval Academy, the US Navy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration, and the State University of New York at Brockport, will conduct
              a Teacher Enhancement Project with a strong leadership component.  An
              innovative Internet-based distance-learning course directed towards
              middle-school teachers will be developed and implemented nationwide.  The
              course,"Water in the Earth System (WES) Online", will incorporate inquiry-based
              instructional strategies and a holistic concept of Earth from oceanic,
              atmospheric and terrestrial water and problem-focused perspectives.  Course
              participants will be prepared as Water in the Earth System (WES) resource
              teachers who will demonstrate the value of Internet access to environmental
              information in classroom applications.  All teachers involved will be prepared
              to promote Earth system studies across the school curriculum in support of the
              National Science Education Standards.

This Project will develop and
              implement a three graduate credit-hour distance learning course partially
              delivered by Internet that introduces over 1,600 teachers to scientifically
              authentic and pedagogically sound learning activities.  As WES resource
              teachers, the course participants will interact with an estimated 16,000
              teachers (and 160,000 students) in their home schools within two years.  A core
              group of  40 teacher Local Implementation Team leaders will be trained to
              provide course implementation and follow-up leadership.

Cost sharing amounts
              to about 5% of the NSF award.
