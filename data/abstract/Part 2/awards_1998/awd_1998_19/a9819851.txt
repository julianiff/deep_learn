This award to Oregon State University will provide equipment in
              support of oceanographic research on R/V Wecoma, a research vessel operated by
              the university as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System research fleet. Specific equipment to be acquired includes an intercom
              system, additional anchor chain, a cable reel stand, GMDSS equipment, an oily
              water separator, a galley steamer, a replacement liquid scintillation counter,
              an emergency fire pump, and  an Inmarsat B communication system.   The
              shared-use equipment supported here will assist marine scientists conducting
              studies from R/V Wecoma, particularly in  the Northeast Pacific Ocean, during
              1999 and future years.
