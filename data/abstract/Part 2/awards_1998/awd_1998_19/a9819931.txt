Cordes, James

This research is based upon a
              long-term search for pulsars using the Arecibo and Green Bank radio facilities.
               The discovery of pulsars with periods shorter than about 1.5 ms sets important
              constraints on the equation of state for nuclear matter and the mechanism by
              which rotational energy is lost.  In one of several parallel efforts, radio
              astrometry will be conducted at the Very Large Array to determine the velocity
              kicks imparted to neutron stars during the supernova process.  The velocity
              distribution so derived may provide useful information on the symmetry and
              energy of supernova explosions, which are standard distance indicators used in
              cosmological studies.  A third major project will be conducted, in order to
              determine the distribution of ionized gas in the interstellar medium and the
              structure of pulsar magnetospheres using radio scintillation as a probe.  These
              projects are expected to yield useful information on the population
              characteristics of neutron stars, and to identify additional planetary
              candidates around certain pulsars.
