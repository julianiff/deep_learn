Abstract    :
              The investigators will deconvolute and understand phenomena that produce
              variations in atmospheric Carbon 14 as a function of time.  Knowledge of the
              time history of Carbon 14 production is essential for dating archeological
              samples. The cause of these variations may also be diagnostic of processes
              involved in climate change. The main effort is to examine this variation with
              high precision measurements of annual tree rings in samples of wood of a known
              age. Measurements will be made with liquid scintillation counters in an
              underground laboratory, and by accelerator mass spectrometry.  A major goal
              will be to evaluate the effect of climate change on the upwelling of Carbon 14
              depleted carbon dioxide along the western coasts of North America, South
              America, and Africa.
