	This project will use a community-based archeological
              excavation as a venue for a national professional development model for
              enhancing high school teachers' understanding of the nature of scientific
              inquiry.  Teachers will collaborate with scientists in an excavation of a peat
              bog on the grounds of a school in Oregon during a 10-day summer institute.  The
              teachers will participate in five two-day workshops in the following academic
              year.  The project will run 51 months; each year 24-48 teachers will
              participate, for a total of 120 teachers over the four years.  Students will
              examine 10 X 25 X 25 cm blocks of peat from the excavation in their classrooms.
               Classrooms will post student-collected data on a web site for access by other
              school classrooms. The subject matter is interdisciplinary, and includes some
              of the social sciences as well.  This project will provide students with
              evidence of evolution, and allow them to draw their own conclusions.  A
              professional development toolkit will be developed during the project, which
              will empower teachers in other parts of the nation to use any local
              community-based scientific project as a theme for incorporating inquiry-based
              approaches into the science classroom.
