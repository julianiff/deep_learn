This is a planning grant to explore possibilities for geospatial data
              mining, conflation, searching, and extraction techniques for integrated air,
              water and land environmental modeling activities in a distributed environment. 
              The long-term goal is to be able to model the transportation and ultimate
              effect of nutrients and chemicals.  EPA would be the primary partner agency
              (with some involvement of the US Geological Survey), and the Neuse River basin
              watershed in North Carolina would be the context.
