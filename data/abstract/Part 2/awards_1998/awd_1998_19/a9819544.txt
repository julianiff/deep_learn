Boston University will conduct a 36-month Teacher and
              Student Development through Research Experience project.  Ten teacher/student
              teams and twenty national students will be recruited each year.  A total of
              thirty local secondary teachers with 30 local secondary students and 60
              national secondary students will be divided into four person teams consisting
              of one teacher/student pair from the same school and two national students. 
              These teams will conduct six-week mathematics explorations in number theory in
              a resident camp during the first year.  In the following academic year the
              teachers will participate in sixteen half-day workshops developing curricular
              materials, as well as offer a research and problem-solving seminar at their
              school.  A website for student research, publication and communication will be
              developed.  Teachers and students can return for a seond year of advanced
              research.
