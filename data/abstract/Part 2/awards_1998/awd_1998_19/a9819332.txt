This award will support a U.S.-Canada collaboration between
              Dr. Jaroslaw Drelich, Michigan Technological University and Dr. Janusz S.
              Laskowski of the University of British Columbia, Canada to study the effect of
              size and distribution of inorganic mineral particles in coal on its
              wettability.  In particular, using advanced modern techniques, the researchers
              will study the effects of the nature, amount, size, and distribution of
              inorganic impurities of coal on both advancing and receding contact angles,
              which affect its wettability.
 
The research is important because coal
              separation and reconstitution processes in coal preparation plants largely
              depend on the wettability of organic and mineral matter constituents of coal. 
              The Canadian side will provide access to a low-temperature ashing technique
              available at the University of British Columbia and contribute their expertise
              in coal surface science, while the U.S. researchers will bring modern
              techniques, using microprobing and X-ray diffraction instruments, that will
              advance the interpretation of experimental data.  The proposed work will
              produce an improved and extended database for the water wettability of coal
              maceral that may lessen the environmental impact of coal use in North
              America.
