Abstract    :
              Pinkel
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment near the
              Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are responsible
              for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the major energy
              pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget for the
              region. A companion modeling effort will focus primarily on the issue of tidal
              scattering as an energy source for ocean mixing while a historical analysis of
              data collected in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands will help guide the
              survey program in determining the location and ubiquity of regions where strong
              mixing activity takes place. Under this particular component of the Farfield
              experiment, the research platform FLIP will be deployed on the south side of
              the Hawaiian Ridge to complement a tomographic array to characterize the
              internal wave field in the upper water column. The overall objective is to
              quantify the barotropic energy flux convergence at the Ridge and the flux
              divergence associated with low mode baroclinic waves radiation. The difference
              is a measure of the tidal power available for mixing at the Ridge.
