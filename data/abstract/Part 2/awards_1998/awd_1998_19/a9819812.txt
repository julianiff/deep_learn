This award supports cooperation between Steven
              Stephenson, Fairmont State College, Fairmont, West Virginia, and Peter
              Johnston, Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research, Aland, New Zealand, on "Myxomycetes
              and Fungi associated with Alpine Snowbank Habitats in New Zealand."  The
              organisms to be studied, plasmodial slime molds associated with alpine
              snowbanks, are part of a group of myxomycetes that are restricted to alpine
              areas and constitute a distinct ecological group.  Snowbank myxomycetes are
              known to occur in New Zealand, but have never been collected and studied to any
              real extent.  In this project, Dr. Stephenson and two undergraduate students
              will travel to New Zealand to conduct the necessary fieldwork in the alpine
              snowbank habitats together with Dr. Johnston.

Establishing biodiversity
              baselines is an important aspect of the proposed work.  In considering issues
              of global climate change, and its implications, a comprehensive understanding
              of organisms in a given ecoregion will be an important resource for tracking
              species change in response to climate change.  Obtaining such knowledge is a
              basic and necessary prerequisite to developing a more complete understanding of
              the structure and function of the ecosystems in which these organisms occur.
