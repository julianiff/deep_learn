Abstract    :
              Moum 9819522
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment near
              the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget
              for the region.  This component of the Survey experiment will consist of
              abyssal observations of microstructure and shear along the northern flank of
              the Hawaiian Ridge using a towed body. Tows will be conducted at depth of 400
              m, 1500 m and 2500 m to locate regions of intense mixing and internal gravity
              wave activity near boundaries and track mixing along tidal beams away from
              boundaries.
