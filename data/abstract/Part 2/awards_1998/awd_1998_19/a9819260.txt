Abstract    :
              This project will conduct a 3-D magnetometric survey across the East Pacific
              Rise at 9 degrees 50 minutes north.  The experiment will use 10 three-component
              seafloor magnetometers to measure the field generated by an artificial source. 
              The primary objective of the experiment will be to identify the pattern and
              depth of active circulation, discriminate between zones of recharge and active
              discharge, and to place physical constraints on models developed from seafloor
              observations.
