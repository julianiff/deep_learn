Abstract    :
              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program
              sub-element of the Interfacial,Transport and Separations program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              Ralph  Yang at the University of Michigan.  The proposed research concerns the
              study of novel adsorbents for three basic types of separations problems.  In
              particular, emphasis is given to those involving olefeneparaffin systems.  The
              basic for the separation in these systems is thought to be largely due to the
              preferential pi-bonding between the olefenic species and the adsorbent, which
              is not present with a low molecularweight paraffin species.  The PI's research
              proposes to continue with the preparation of both silver and copper-based
              sorbents for these separations. In addition, the PI is proposing the study of
              both dioxin adsorption, using silver salts supported on silcia supports, and NO
               adsorption from hot combustion gases.  Experimental work is described in each
              of these ares.  Futhermore, an initio molcular
orbital calculations are
              planned in an attempt to provide a more detailed understanding of the
              catiion-sorbate binding step that is an essential part of the adsorption
              mechanism in each of these systems.
