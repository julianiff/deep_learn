WestEd, WGBH-TV, the Boston Museum of Science, and
              Horizon Research, Inc. will produce, field test, and disseminate a collection
              of videotapes and accompanying learning materials to promote effective
              professional development for teachers of science and mathematics, grades K-12. 
              The project is designed to address the problem that current approaches to
              professional development are inadequate to address reform mandates that call
              for teachers to learn and teach more challenging science and mathematics.  The
              proposed materials are intended for people who design and conduct professional
              development and those who prepare professional developers.  They will be based
              on the recent book, Designing Professional Development for Teachers of Science
              and Mathematics, produced by the National Institute for Science Education.  The
              videotapes and companion print materials will illustrate the book's central
              thesis that all staff developers should consider a wide range of strategies
              when planning a comprehensive professional development program.  They  will
              show multiple examples of professional development strategies for both
              mathematics and science and for elementary, middle, and high school teachers.
