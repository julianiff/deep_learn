Abstract    :
              This work combines instrument development and scientific observations
and seeks
              to apply a proven laboratory technique to the observation of
turbulence in the
              coastal ocean.   A Particle Imagery Velocimetry (PIV) instrument will be
              deployed on an extensible platform resting
on the sea-floor in coastal waters.
               After testing, the device will
be deployed in 15m of water at the LEO-15 site
              and used to repeatedly
measure the flow field over an area of from 0.25 to 0.5
              m^2. The resulting data will be used to examine various properties of
              turbulence in the coastal ocean and its dependence on environmental
parameters
              such as stratification, wave state and macroscopic shear.
Additional data will
              be collected from the instrument suite already
in place at LEO-15 in order to
              characterize the environmental parameters.  Separate deployments during late
              spring and fall will allow the PIs to study turbulence in different degrees of
              stratification.
