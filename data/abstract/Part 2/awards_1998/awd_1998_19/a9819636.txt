The Penn-Merck partnership will establish a 5-year project
              in the School District of Philadelphia to promote effective inquiry-based
              teaching in grades 5-8.  The project will work in close collaboration with the
              Philadelphia Urban Systemic Initiative.  Teacher participants will increase and
              deepen their knowledge of science content and develop the ability to use
              inquiry-based approaches to science instruction.  The project will use a
              two-tiered approach to:

1. Build the capacity of a "critical mass" of middle
              grades science teachers (Tier 1) in West Philadelphia.  All Tier 1 teachers
              will participate in a 13-month professional development program. 

2. Prepare
              a smaller group of Leader Teachers (Tier 2) to drive the process of long-term
              change in the district.  These teachers will participate in a 25-month program,
              which includes extensive leadership activities.  By serving as peer mentors and
              resource specialists in their schools and at the cluster and district levels
              the Leader Teachers will establish a solid foundation for the reform of science
              education in the middle grades. 

Five cohorts, of 48 teachers each, will
              participate in the Tier 1 program and one cohort of 30 teachers will
              participate in the Tier 2 program.  The project will prepare a total of 270
              middle school teachers who will have a direct impact on approximately 10,000
              students per year.
