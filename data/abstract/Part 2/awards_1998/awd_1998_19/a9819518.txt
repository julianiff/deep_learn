Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget
              for the region. This modeling effort will focus primarily on computing
              barotropic inverse solutions around the Hawaiian Ridge using existing tidal
              models, the altimetric data from TOPEX/POSEIDON and the tomographic data
              collected during the Farfield experiment. Detailed barotropic flux calculation
              with error bars will calculated. Finall, the barotropic inversion code will be
              modified to accommodate stratification in order to calculate the energy flux of
              low-order baroclinic modes.
