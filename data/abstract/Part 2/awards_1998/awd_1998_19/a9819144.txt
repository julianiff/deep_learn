              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819144 / OCE-9903391


In this study, investigators from
              Princeton University and Oregon State University will use the new, high-quality
              nutrient data set obtained during NOAA-OACES and WOCE  field studies to refine
              estimates of the relative amounts of phosphorous, nitrogen, and carbon
              generated during the decomposition, or remineralization, of marine organic
              matter - the so-called Redfield Ratio (P:N:C).  The Redfield Ratio is not a new
              concept; in fact, it has been used, and its approximate value has been known,
              for decades.  Ocean scientists have relied on estimates of the Ratio to
              calculate a values of a variety of unmeasured biogeochemical values from the
              values of ones that have been measured.  Analysis of the high-quality nutrient
              data sets generated in recent years demands that the Redfield estimate be
              improved, and this is what this team of investigators intends to do.  An
              optimal multi-parameter technique will also be developed to determine ratio
              endpoints for application to modeling of biogeochemical data collected during
              the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) as well as from OACES and WOCE.  The
              technique will be applied to twenty neutral-density layers in each ocean basin
              to achieve some idea of the global variability as well as a global averaged
              Redfield value.
