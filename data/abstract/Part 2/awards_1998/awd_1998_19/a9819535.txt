Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              (HOME: Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment) near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine
              whether sites with rough topography are responsible for the mixing of the
              global ocean. The goals are to identify the major energy pathways for ocean
              mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget for the region. The Near-field
              experiment of the HOME project focuses on the investigation of the dynamical
              processes in the immediate vicinity of the Hawaiian Ridge, and especially the
              response to barotropic tidal forcing including generation  of low- and
              high-mode internal waves, propagation and turbulent dissipation and mixing.
              This sub-project will focus on mapping the spatial extent and spring/neap
              variability of the internal tide over Kaena Pt. Ridge. Specifically, the
              Advanced microstructure profiler (AMP) will be deployed with a depth-cycling
              towed body from the stern of the R/V Revelle while moving slowly across and
              parallel to the Ridge. The shipboard sonar will simultaneously map the velocity
              field to 700 m. Upward and downward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers
              (ADCP) on the towed body will measure deep shear closer to the bottom and with
              higher vertical resolution that can be measured by shipboard ADCPs.
