Abstract    :
              This award will support an upgrade and expansion of the stable isotope analytic
              facilities for the College of Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State
              University.  The existing MAT 251 will be refitted with a Kiel carbonate device
              and modern computer controller, and a new mass spectrometer will be purchased
              with continuous flow and dual inlets for analyses of water and organic matter
              (solids and gases).
