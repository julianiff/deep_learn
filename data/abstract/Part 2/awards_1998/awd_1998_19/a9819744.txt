Abstract    :
                   This project will identify the effect of information technology on the
              location of economic activity. Advances in information technology have the
              potential to affect firms' location in many ways: with new technologies, a firm
              might find that it no longer needs to be in cities, or it might no longer need
              to be near rural clients; a firm might decide to disperse its operations over
              several distant sites, or it might decide to consolidate in one location. The
              theoretical possibilities are many, and the overall impact is ultimately an
              empirical question.  By linking data on changes in firm location with data on
              information technology usage, this research will distinguish which of the
              popular notions about technology and cities is accurate.
