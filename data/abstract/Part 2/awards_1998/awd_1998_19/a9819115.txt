Abstract    :
              This award to the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans
              in Science (SACNAS) enables that organization to recruit approximately 100
              Native American and Latino undergraduate and graduate students from the
              non-biomedical sciences to participate in the 1998 SACNAS National Conference
              to be held in Washington, DC on October 8-11, 1998.  At the conference, these
              students will present results of research activities in which they have been
              involved and also attend mentoring sessions designed to assist them in planning
              for subsequent educational and employment pursuits.  Additionally, a session is
              planned in which NSF staff will describe opportunities for Foundation support
              of research and education activities.

In the past, SACNAS national
              conferences have focussed on students with biomedical backgrounds and
              interests, primarily because financial support for these conferences has been
              provided largely by the National Institutes of Health.  This award provides
              funds that will be used to broaden the disciplinary perspective of the
              conference to include those disciplines that are reflected in the investment
              portfolios of NSF.  Short-term goals of this activity include a marked increase
              in the number of SACNAS conference student attendees with interests in the
              non-biomedical sciences and engineering.  In the longer term, increases in
              Latino and Native Americans in NSF-relevant science and engineering activities
              are expected.
