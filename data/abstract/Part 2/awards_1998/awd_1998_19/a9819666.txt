Abstract    :
              This grant will fund a 3 year study of the genesis of the oceanic crust at
              spreading ridges, based on evidence from the mantle and lower crust of a thrust
              slice of oceanic crust and upper mantle in Oman.  Our main objectives are to
              constrain (1) porous flow and/or fracture mechanisms of melt extraction from
              the mantle, and (2) formation of the igneous lower oceanic crust via
              combinations of two end-member possibilities:  (a) crystallization in a single
              magma chamber plus ductile flow downward and outward to form the lower crust,
              and (b) crystallization of lower crustal plutonic rocks in many small magma
              chambers close to their current depth of emplacement.  In addition, we seek to
              address related questions concerning (3) melt extraction mechanisms in the
              lower crust, (4) deformation mechanisms and strain partitioning in the lower
              crust, and (5) igneous cooling and crystallization rates beneath the axis of an
              oceanic spreading ridge.
