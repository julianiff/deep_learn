This project is for a study of the role of geostrophic
              eddies in setting the stratification of the main thermocline in the ocean. 
              Laboratory and numerical analogues of the ocean gyre will be studied.  A
              hierarchy of more complex and realistic models will be used to explore the
              hypothesized processes that set the stratification and depth of ocean gyres and
              circumpolar currents.
