Abstract    :
              Rudnick 9819521
Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              near the 
Hawaiian Ridge to determine whether sites with rough topography are
              
responsible for the mixing of the global ocean. The goals are to identify the
              major 
energy pathways for ocean mixing and achieve an approximate energy
              budget 
for the region. The SeaSoar and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
              survey 
alongside the Hawaiian Ridge will compile statistics of both
              stratification and 
shear to identify sites of likely intense mixing and it
              will use recent internal waves 
parameterization and estimates of vertical
              overturns to infer dissipation and 
diffusivity. Deployment of several
              LAgrangian Microstructure Profilers (LAMP) will 
help quantify thermal
              dissipation in both homogeneous and stratified regions of 
the upper 400 m of
              the ocean.
