Abstract    :
              This is a two-year standard award.  A workshop for grantees of the NSF Human
              Computer Interaction Program will be held in late February 1999.  The increased
              importance of a meeting of researchers in HCI is underscored by a recent report
              of the Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee (  HYPERLINK
              http://www.ccic.gov/ac/interim/   http://www.ccic.gov/ac/interim/ ) which calls
              for significantly increased research efforts in this area.  Attendees of the
              prior grantees workshops consistently recount the enriching experiences they
              encountered.  The workshops allow researchers to broaden their perspectives,
              learn of related fields, and obtain an understanding of the implications of
              these areas to their own research.  The opportunities to build new
              collaborations about at these workshops.  The proposed agenda will be developed
              by a steering committee, with feedback from participants of last year's event. 
              Continuing with the mission adopted by the past workshops, the primary focus of
              the workshop will be to foster fruitful exchange of ideas and to simulate
              interaction among colleagues.  The workshop will produce an HTML document to be
              resident for a minimum of one year on the web, which will summarize the diverse
              projects supported by the program.
