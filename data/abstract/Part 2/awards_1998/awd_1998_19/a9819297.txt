Abstract    :
              A series of both on-bottom seismic refraction experiments using bottom shots and
              receivers, and seismic refraction profiles using airgun shots and seafloor
              receivers was conducted on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in locations where there are
              extensive outcrops of mantle peridotites.  The objectives of this project are
              to:  (1) determine the depth extend of ultramafic bodies found in the three
              locations, (2) contrast the velocity structure at these known peridotite
              outcrops with that found in a typical extrusive-dike-gabbro igneous section
              formed at a fas spreading ridge, and (3) use the fine-scale velocity structure
              of these peridotite exposures to identify massive, unfractured outcrops where
              drilling conditions are good.
