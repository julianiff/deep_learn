Digital Government:  A
              Planning Proposal: Quality Graphics for Federal Statistical Summaries

This
              grant will support the planning and coordination between the PI and potential
              partners in Federal statistical agencies, vendors, and industry to explore the
              development of a full proposal in the area of graphical representation of
              statistical data. Included will be perceptual and cognitive issues and
              usability testing, aimed toward improving the communication abilities of
              tabular data to make it more useful to a broader segment of the public. Java
              will be the programming language used to construct broadly distributable
              applications and applets.
