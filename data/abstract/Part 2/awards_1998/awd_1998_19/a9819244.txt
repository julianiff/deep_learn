              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819244

In this project, researchers from the Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography will assemble available data on the total marine
              carbon measurements in the Pacific Ocean and attempt to estimate the
              anthropogenic and natural components of carbon dioxide in that basin.  In
              addition to quantification of the carbon inventories, the researchers will
              prepare carbon measurements from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
              and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) for assimilation and use in
              diagnostic inverse modeling of the Pacific Ocean.  The results will be useful
              in characterizing the exchange of carbon dioxide, both anthropogenic and
              non-anthropogenic, between the Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere in relation to
              global climate.
