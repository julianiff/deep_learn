Abstract    :
              This research program will develop a method for assimilating energetic particle
              data from satellites into the empirical CRRES-ELE model for outer belt
              energetic particles.  The data assimilation technique to be used is a form of
              "nudging" that is commonly used in assimilating data into terrestrial weather
              models.  The technique has already been shown to reduce the error in the
              CRESS-ELE model by as much as an order of magnitude.  The goal of the program
              will be to produce a model of outer belt energetic particles that is 80%
              accurate under all conditions.  The outputs of the model will be tailored for
              use by the NOAA Space Environment Center and the Air Force 55th Space Weather
              squadron.
