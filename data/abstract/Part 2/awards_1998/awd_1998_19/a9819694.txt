              ABSTRACT

"Astrophysics of Single and Binary Star
              Evolution"
AST-9819694

This is an imaging and spectroscopic investigation
              of the role binary stars play in the process of star formation.  Infrared (IR)
              spectra are used to penetrate the dusty regions surrounding young T Tauri
              binary stars so as to obtain radial velocities for their component stars.  The
              study focuses on improving mass ratios, particularly for components of
              dissimilar mass.  Present surveys tend to be heavily biased towards equal-mass
              pairs.  In a parallel effort, high angular resolution IR observations employing
              adaptive optics techniques are obtained to determine the binary frequency in
              the cluster NGC 2024.  In a third project, an attempt is being made to identify
              the ice-band absorption features in the spectra of some young binaries in order
              to test the hypothesis that observed light variations are produced by structure
              ("clumpiness") in remnant accretion disks.
