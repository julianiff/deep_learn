Abstract    :
              Northern Red Sea is still undergoing continental rifting and the area is an
              active, modern analog to older, non-volvanic passive margins.  The PI will
              study existing geophysical data on bathymetry, gravity, magnetics, heat flow
              and seismic reflection and refraction collected by various institutions and the
              industry to investigate the establishment of an oceanic spreading center within
              a continental rift.  The study will lead to an understanding of the rupturing
              process and nucleation of a spreading center in the continental lithosphere to
              form new ocean basins.
