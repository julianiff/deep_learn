              ABSTRACT

OCE-9819086 


Recent studies have suggested that nitrogen
              fixation may play a central role in controlling the oceanic inventory of
              combined nitrogen, primarily nitrogen in the form of dissolved nitrate in the
              deep ocean.  As a macronutrient limiting primary production in much of the
              ocean, nitrogen not only plays a critical role in maintaining the ecology of
              the sea but also in regulating the capacity of the ocean to drawn down
              atmospheric carbon dioxide and fix it into organic form.  In this study, the
              PIs will use the isotopic composition of nitrate to evaluate and quantify the
              importance of N2 fixation in supplying combined nitrogen to the oligotrohpic
              central North Atlantic.  This isotopic approach will complement ongoing efforts
              to measure the rates of oceanic nitrogen fixation directly.
