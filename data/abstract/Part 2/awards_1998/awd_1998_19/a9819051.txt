This three-year project intends to develop instructional
              kits, which will assist students in making the conceptual connection between
              molecular genetics and gene expression in plants.  Kits will consist of a
              booklet describing the biological/genetic concept (illustrated), Wisconsin Fast
              Plants of pre-determined genetic lines, photographs of DNA marker bands from
              electrophoresis gels, and a classroom poster showing a linkage map of 50
              genetic markers on the 10 chromosomes of Brassica rapa.  In addition, advanced
              protocols and reagents for extracting DNA and amplifying it using PCR will be
              available as an option for those schools with the appropriate equipment. 
              Biology students in middle and high school (grades 6-12) biology classes will
              use these kits.  The kits will allow students to make a visual connection
              between the results of DNA analysis (separated bands of DNA on electrophoresis
              gels) and observations of plant morphology, a connection many students have
              difficulty making. The laboratory explorations promote inquiry-based learning
              in genetic research and effectively illustrate the utility of genetics in
              solving problems of scientific as well as social issues.  In addition, it
              utilizes plants in an area that has become over-represented with animal models.
               Carolina Biological Supply Company, who already markets Wisconsin Fast Plant
              kits for classroom study, will donate 6 PCR thermal cyclers which can be used
              in a lending program, as well as other contributions to cover expenses for
              teacher training workshops. The University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement in
              Biology Program will assist the PI in the execution of the professional
              development workshops.
