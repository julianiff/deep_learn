The Gilbert Systemic Science Plan is a Local Systemic
              Change project for Gilbert Unified School District #41 to implement a hands-on,
              inquiry-based vision of science education that conforms to national and state
              standards.  The reform effort grows out of a comprehensive planning process led
              by the Gilbert Science Leadership Team, with broad involvement from community
              advisory panels, district administration, classroom teachers, school
              principals, and scientists and engineers from corporate and university
              communities.  The project will involve over six hundred teachers from eighteen
              different schools over the course of the project.  The implementation of the
              science program, Science and Technology for Children (STC), will be spread over
              three years and the school district is committed to the support of all
              classroom materials.  In addition, science and science education faculty from
              Arizona State University's departments of biology, chemistry, geology and
              physics and its College of Education will collaborate with Gilbert lead
              teachers to design and instruct inservice courses and professional development
              workshops tailored specifically to the Gilbert K-6 science program.
