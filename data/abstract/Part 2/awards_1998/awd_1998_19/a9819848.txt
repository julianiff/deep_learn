Abstract    :
              A two-year effort is proposed to investigate the causes of ionospheric
              variability using a state-of-the-art physical model and a large database of
              ionospheric observations.  The HAO/NCAR
              Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamic General Circulation Model
              (TIME-GCM) has recently been coupled to the NCAR Community Climate Model -
              Version 3 (CCM/3) to assess the influence of Tropospheric-Stratospheric input
              to the upper atmosphere.  The first prolonged run of the merged TIME-GCM/CCM3
              was for a 365 day period characterized by constant solar flux and fixed auroral
              and magnetospheric inputs.  The output of this simulation offers an
              extraordinary opportunity to conduct a series of validation studies using
              existing ionosonde data from the archived global network.  Moreover, the
              opportunity to access diagnostic parameters beyond the peak density (NmF2),
              such as thermospheric densities, temperatures and winds and electrodynamical
              drifts, provides the information needed to interpret the results using known
              physical processes.
