J. Zakin, Ohio State U.

A Turkey - Israel - US
              Chemcial Engineering Workshop will be held at the Technion in Israel on March
              9-12, 1999.  Approximately twenty participants from the US will attend as well
              as a similar number of participants, each from Turkey and Israel.  The goal of
              the workshop is to enhance education in the three countries by providing a
              forum for interaction among the participants.

Four topics have been selected
              from the workshop because of their technical and economic importance in
              chemical engineering research and education in all three countries.  The topics
              are:

1. Membranes and separation process
2. Polymers and other advanced
              materials
3. Catalysis and catalytic processes
4. Biotechnology
