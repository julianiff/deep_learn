Kwitter, Karen

This project focuses on the
              spectroscopic determination of chemical abundances for planetary nebulae (PNe)
              as tracers of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and yields of stellar
              nucleosynthesis.  The objectives of the study include: (1) deriving the radial
              gradients of sulfur (S) and argon (Ar) across the disk of the Galaxy; (2)
              investigating the hypothesis that S and Ar can be used as tracers of Fe in
              stellar metallicity studies;  (3) determination of the metallicity of the
              central star of PNe;  (4) using the metallicities implied to test theoretical
              yields of nuclear processing in intermediate-mass stars; and (5) testing the
              reported abundance gradients within individual PNe.  Some of the data for this
              study has already been collected.  New high-resolution spectroscopic data will
              be obtained at the Apache Point Observatory and elsewhere, as required.
