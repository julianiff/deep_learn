This three-year project builds on other "tools" developed by
              Project 2061, and is designed to support science and mathematics educators in
              aligning assessments with standards and benchmarks.  The project will:

   
              Develop criteria and an analysis procedure for judging alignment of assessment
              tasks to learning goals;
    Produce case studies of using the criteria to
              revise existing tasks and create new ones; and
    Make the tools available to
              educators in a useful form.

Dissemination will occur through the web,
              CD-ROM, and assessment workshops.

The evaluation will be conducted by the
              BEAR Center at Berkeley.
