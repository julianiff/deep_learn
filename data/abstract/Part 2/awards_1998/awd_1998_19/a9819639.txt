The State University of New York College at Oswego seeks
              funding for a 36-month Teacher and Student Development through Research
              Experience project.  Each year, eight teams consisting of a mathematics teacher
              and an earth science teacher will conduct research at SUNY Oswego on Great
              Lakes weather.  For two weeks, two students from the school of each team will
              join the teachers in a residential setting to continue research studies.  Field
              trips to area weather stations will occur leading to research projects
              conducted by the teams during the succeeding academic year.

The second year
              will target teams from inner city schools while the third year will target
              rural schools.
