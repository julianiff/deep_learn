Abstract    :
              This award supports a two-day interdisciplinary workshop on Automated Control of
              Distributed Instrumentation.  The workshop will be held on April 22-23, 1999 in
              the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of
              Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The workshop aims to provide an interdisciplinary
              forum for the exchange of information on automated control of distributed
              imaging instrumentation (microscopy, robotics, machine vision, etc.) as well as
              the enabling technologies (distributed computing, networking and operating
              systems) necessary to support remote instrumentation and its automated control.
               The proceedings will be printed by the Beckman Institute.  The printed
              proceeding will be supplemented with the Internet access to a WWW server
              containing speakers' slides, images, and animations.
