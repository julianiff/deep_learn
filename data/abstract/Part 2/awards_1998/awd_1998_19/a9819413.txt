Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the construction of a comprehensive web-based regional
              empirical model of the ionosphere using incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data
              from the period 1970-present.  This model will include two parts: first, a
              model of basic and derived scalar parameters as measured at Millstone Hill,
              Massachusetts (42.6o N), including electron density Ne, electron and ion
              temperature (Te and Ti), neutral meridional wind, and exospheric temperature;
              and second, a model of the ExB plasma drifts and corresponding electrostatic
              potential patterns, as obtained from measurements at Millstone Hill and at the
              Sondrestrom facility in Greenland (67.0oN).  The parameters that will be
              modeled have been identified in the National Space Weather Program (NSWP)
              Implementation Plan as important ones which must be specified and forecast in
              response to customer operational support requirements.  All of them have also
              been identified by the NSWP Metrics Panel as either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd priority
              parameters which define the state and condition of the ionosphere-thermosphere
              (IT) system.
