Cohen, Judith

This project investigates the chemical abundances
              of evolving stars in the galactic clusters M13 and M71.  Using the Keck
              Observatory data archive and new spectra taken at the Palomar Observatory, a
              search is being conducted to identify chemical abundance variations, if any,
              among ~75 main sequence stars in each cluster by measuring the strengths of
              atomic lines and molecular features.  Scatter larger than the expected
              measurement errors is used to detect abundance variations in the sample.  For a
              subset of these stars, a second phase of the project may be undertaken. 
              Detailed atmospheric models will be used to derive effective temperatures and
              surface gravities.  Combining these results with distance estimates provided by
              Hipparcos and other projects, the masses of the stars can be estimated and the
              importance of mixing during various evolutionary phases of near solar-mass
              stars can be investigated.  The results may help to resolve
 the discrepancy
              between the age estimates for globular clusters and determinations of the
              Hubble constant.
