Abstract    :
              This research program is designed to utilize data obtained from the Los Alamos
              National Laboratory (LANL) Geosynchronous satellites to improve the
              Magnetospheric Specification Model (MSM) developed at Rice University.  The
              project is a joint program with LANL (M. Thomsen, PI, ATM-9819875).  The
              project will investigate methods of assimilating near real-time energetic
              particle data from the LANL satellites into the MSM.  The project will also
              explore the sensitivity of the model output to the input data and will
              determine which input parameters  provide the most useful improvements to the
              model output.  Additionally, the project will make changes to the MSM code to
              make us of advances in computer capabilities.
