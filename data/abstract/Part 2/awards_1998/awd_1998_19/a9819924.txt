Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop detailed physical pictures of a number of
              geoeffective solar eruptive events to serve as a reference for future data
              acquisition, analysis and forecasting of space weather.  Events in question
              occured in the pre-solar maximum epoch, and hence avoid confusion from the
              overlap of different events.  The approach is to identify the drivers of
              coronal and interplanetary shocks by analyzing more than two dozen type II
              radio bursts in conjunction with other data.  For the first time, actual
              coronagraph data and flow speed will be used to determine the speed and
              starting height of coronal and interplanetary shocks.
