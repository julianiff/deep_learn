This research seeks to improve
              the theoretical understanding of the observed characteristics of periodic and
              nonperiodic variable stars, whose energy output changes on timescales of days
              to weeks.  Understanding the physics of these types of luminous variable stars
              impacts areas beyond the field of stellar research.  Since their luminosities
              are related to the type of variability they exhibit, this work contributes
              directly to calibrating the distances to structures within our Galaxy, and also
              to the extragalactic distance scale.  A detailed set of convective hydrodynamic
              models, supplemented by semi-analytical computations, will be constructed for
              classical variables such as Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars.  In addition, this
              code will be applied to more exotic nonperiodic variables such as W Virginis
              and RV Tauri stars that are often found in the older populations of the
              Galaxy.
