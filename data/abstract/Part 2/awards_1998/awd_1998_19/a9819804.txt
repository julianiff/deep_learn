Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue assessing the possibility of using data from the
              IRIDIUM satellites to continuously monitor the location of the auroral oval. 
              The magnetometers on the satellites measure perturbations when passing through
              field-aligned currents associated with auroral precipitation.  The combined
              data from many satellites can be used to identify the instantaneous location of
              the auroral oval on a global basis.  The auroral oval reflects the global state
              of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and the field-aligned currents are the
              principal means by which stresses are transmitted from the magnetosphere to the
              ionosphere.  The investigators will define the science products that can be
              derived from the IRIDIUM magnetometer data and perform scientific qualification
              studies of these products to determine their accuracy, reliability, and
              relation to currently available monitors of the auroral boundaries, currents,
              and magnetospheric dynamics.  The study includes the development of algorithms
              for handling the data from multiple spacecraft automatically, comparison of
              results for individual case studies, and the negotiation of an agreement with
              Motorola Corp. for long-term access to the data.
