This professional materials development project will develop
              materials to support the implementation of the NSF-supported middle school
              mathematics curriculum projects.  These materials include:  video lessons
              highlighting activities from all five of the aforementioned projects; print
              support materials for each video lesson indicating where the lesson appears in
              the mathematical development of the project, specific teaching suggestions, and
              cross references to the other four projects; interactive, facilitated,
              web-based resources which provide for participant discussion and special online
              events.  The project is designed for mathematics teachers, mathematics
              supervisors, district coordinators of instruction, and teacher educators.  The
              project will link with the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics
              (Standards 2000, NCTM, 1998) and is supported by the Show-Me Implementation
              Center for middle school mathematics.
