Funding is provided to conduct a large coordinated experiment
              (HOME: Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment) near the Hawaiian Ridge to determine
              whether sites with rough topography are responsible for the mixing of the
              global ocean. The goals are to identify the major energy pathways for ocean
              mixing and achieve an approximate energy budget for the region. The Near-field
              experiment of the HOME project focuses on the investigation of the dynamical
              processes in the immediate vicinity of the Hawaiian Ridge, and especially the
              response to barotropic tidal forcing including generation  of low- and
              high-mode internal waves, propagation and turbulent dissipation and mixing.
              This sub-project will focus on relating the local turbulence and shear across
              the ridgetop to the temporal variability of the tidally-induced shear and
              strain determined by the fixed point observations from the research platform
              FLIP and current meter moorings. A deep towed body (Marlin) and a vertical
              microstructure profiler (Chameleon) will be deployed during spring and neap
              tides. Some observations will also be conducted south of the Ridge to depth of
              3000 m in order to establish the spatial variability of high dissipation rates
              observed by other HOME investigators.
