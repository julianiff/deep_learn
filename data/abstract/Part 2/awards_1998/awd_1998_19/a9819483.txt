Abstract    :
              The investigator will coordinate and organize a workshop in Boulder, Colorado,
              to bring together solar physicists from all over the world.  The workshop is
              referred to as SHINE, which stands for Solar Heliospheric INterplanetary
              Environment.  It is an affiliation of researchers dedicated to promoting
              enhanced understanding of and predictive capabilities for solar disturbances
              that propagate to Earth. SHINE represents the solar physics community's
              contribution to Space Weather, which has become a high priority program with
              the potential for fundamental scientific advances in areas that will have
              important societal impact. The request includes a small amount of the PI's time
              for organizing the workshop with the remaining funds for participant support
              costs.
