For the past six years, the PIs have overseen the operation
              of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) on a container ship of
              opportunity, the CMV Oleander, on weekly round trip transits from New Jersey to
              Bermuda.  The original objective was to track the low frequency variability of
              the Gulf Stream, particularly with respect to variations in mass and heat
              (temperature) transport.  During this period, the Gulf Stream has been quite
              stable, while the recirculation gyres show noticeable variability.  A strong
              correlation between Slope Water temperature and mean latitude of the Gulf
              Stream suggests that the latter is controlled by shelf water transports from
              the Labrador Sea, on annual and even longer time scales.  In this project, the
              PIs will continue this series for another four years to determine if recently
              observed major changes in the North Atlantic wind stress (drop in the NAO
              index) are reflected in changes in the Gulf Stream transport.  Other major
              changes in global forcing (El Nino, La Nina) also may have effects that would
              show up in the next several years.
