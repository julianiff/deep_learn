Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, applies surface science methods to the investigation of the detailed
              mechanisms of hydrocarbon reactions on platinum and nickel surfaces.  Professor
              Francisco Zaera and his coworkers at UC-Riverside use photon and electron
              induced excitation of precursor molecules to prepare important surface
              intermediates.  Isothermal kinetic studies of surface reactions are carried
              out, and work is focussed on the effects of weakly bound intermediates in
              hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions.  Structure-activity correlations are
              being made, and differences in behavior between various transition metals that
              catalyze these reactions are examined. 

An understanding of the detailed
              mechanisms of the addition and removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons catalyzed
              by platinum and nickel surfaces is the focus of this research project. 
              Preparation of transient intermediates and weakly adsorbed species which may be
              involved in these reactions helps to provide detailed mechanistic information
              for these reactions.  Fundamental knowledge about surface reaction mechanisms
              and rates is central to the development of new and better catalytic
              materials.
