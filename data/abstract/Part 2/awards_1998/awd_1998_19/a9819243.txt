This proposal, sponsored by the Lawrence Hall of Science,
              will develop and field test a module called the Student Radon Research
              curriculum module.  The module will be an issues-oriented,
              investigation-centered earth science program specifically intended for grades
              7-9.  The module will consist of a series of activities related to the behavior
              of radon in the earth system.  The modules use the techniques and
              instrumentation of professional scientists.  The modules will allow students to
              gather radon and meteorological data derived from their own observations, use
              computers to store and analyze the data, prepare tables and graphs of the data
              and, based upon an analysis of the data, develop hypotheses.  The module will
              also include a series of hands-on classroom activities which will introduce
              students to important science and mathematics concepts appropriate to the
              middle grades.  The instructional materials will be such that they will easily
              supplement the regular earth science curriculum.  Cost sharing funds amount to
              about 6% of the NSF award.
