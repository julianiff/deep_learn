The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will develop and
              test, over a five-year period, a professional development program in assessment
              in mathematics for teachers in grades 4 to 12.  A total of seventy-two hours of
              professional development will be delivered through three workshops:  Assessment
              Literacy, Developing Classroom Assessment Skills, and Honing Classroom
              Assessment Skills, as well as classroom follow-up.  A writing team composed
              mostly of classroom teachers will develop the workshop materials.  The
              Assessment Committee of the Association of State Supervisors of Mathematics
              will review the completed materials.  Workshop leaders will be selected and
              trained to pilot the materials in middle and high schools in North Carolina,
              South Carolina and Virginia.  The materials will be disseminated through a
              series of conferences publicized through the Association of State Supervisors
              of Mathematics.
