"Stellar Abundances and Chemical Evolution
              from Infrared Spectroscopy"
AST-9819870

The chemical abundances of stars in
              clusters near the center of the Galaxy will be studied using new
              high-resolution infrared spectroscopic techniques.  The evolutionary trends of
              carbon and oxygen abundances, relative to iron, are key tracers of stellar and
              galactic chemical evolution.  The abundances of these elements will be
              estimated using the infrared spectral lines of CO and OH, respectively.  Both
              elements provide valuable constraints on stellar interior models, especially
              with regards to the dredge-up of nuclear processed material via convective
              motions and rotation.  The use of infrared spectra will facilitate stellar
              abundance determinations in the most heavily obscured regions of the Galactic
              center.  The results of this study are likely to improve our understanding of
              the chemical evolution of the Galaxy as well as the ages of the Galactic bulge
              and globular clusters.
