Abstract    :
              This research project will develop a technique for measuring the electron
              density enhancements due to precipitation of relativistic electrons from the
              outer radiation belts.  VLF radio propagation effects will be used to determine
              the relative delays in propagation time between a number of different receiver
              sites.  These variations in the delay time will then be related to the
              relativistic electron fluxes observed by satellites such as SAMPEX, UARS and
              POLAR.  This technique would ultimately allow a network of receiver sites to
              monitor not only the space weather effects of precipitating relativistic
              electrons, but it would also be possible to infer the fluxes of relativistic
              electrons in the outer radiation belt.
