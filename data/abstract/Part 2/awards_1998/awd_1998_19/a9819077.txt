	The modern capitalist economy of industrialized countries
              like the US has shifted recently from "Fordist" production, premised on the
              existence of a mass market for standardized goods and using assembly line
              techniques with separate processes for the conception and execution of
              production, to a "post-Fordist" regime where the fear of capital flight and
              plant disinvestment leads to lower job security and wages for many workers
              along with a "flexible specialization" production system involving specialized
              markets, skilled adaptable highly-paid workers and more general purpose
              machinery. This research is an ethnographic case study of a textile company's
              relations with its workers and their communities in Virginia. The study will
              show how the new conditions of employment affect household and community life. 
              Changes in the moral contract involved in the employment relation will be
              studied using extensive interviews with managers and workers, a sample survey
              of workers, examination of archives and participant observation in two
              communities, one where the plant was transformed and one in which the plant was
              closed down. 
This research is important because it advances our understanding
              of a major change in the employment relation in contemporary society.  It will
              evaluate different theoretical explanations of the changes in the relation
              between capital and labor and will provide insight into the newly developing
              moral contract between employing organizations, workers, and the local
              communities. The new knowledge to be created by this project will be valuable
              to planners and politicians as well as to industry personnel.
