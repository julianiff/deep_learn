This award to University of Minnesota will provide
              instrumentation for Great Lakes research for use on R/V Blue Heron, a research
              vessel operated by the Large Lakes Observatory. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a CTD system and associated pH, oxygen, fluorometer,
              transmissometer and bottom location sensors, and a carousel water sampling
              system. The award also provides funds to acquire meteorological sensors for
              shipboard use. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              scientists to conduct research in the Great Lakes in 1999 and future
              years.
