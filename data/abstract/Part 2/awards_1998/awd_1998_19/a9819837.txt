This is a two year dissertation enhancement project
              proposed by Ms. Helen Fox and her adviser, Dr. Roy Caldwell, University of
              California at Berkeley.  Ms. Helen Fox  requests funds for travel and local
              support to carry out a study on environmental factors influencing recovery of
              coral reefs damaged by destructive fishing practices in Indonesia.    The goal
              of this study is to develop inexpensive and effective reef rehabilitation
              methods that can be incorporated into reef management programs in Southeast
              Asia.  This is a cooperative project with the Center for Coastal and Marine
              Resources Studies, Bogor Agricultural University.
