This award to Duke University will provide equipment in support
              of oceanographic research on R/V Cape Hatteras, a research vessel operated by
              the Duke/University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              equipment to be acquired includes a new transducer array for the 3.5 kHz
              echosounding system (including installation) and a forklift for support of
              vessel loading and offloading.   The shared-use equipment supported here will
              assist marine scientists conduct studies from R/V Cape Hatteras in the
              Northwest Atlantic Ocean during 1999 and future years.
