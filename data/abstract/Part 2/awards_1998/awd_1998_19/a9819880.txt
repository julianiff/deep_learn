Digital
              Government:  Digitalization of Coastal Management and Decision-Making Supported
              by Multi-Dimensional Geospatial Information and Analysis

With continuing
              trend of population and economic growth in coastal areas, a sustainable
              environment becomes more threatened. Global warming, climate change, coastal
              erosion, and pollution are common problems. Geospatial information and analysis
              can be used to coordinate policies related to coastal resource management,
              surveying, shoreline mapping, change detection, and natural hazards
              mitigation.

This grant will support a workshop and ancillary activities to
              develop plans for research to enhance operational capabilities of government
              agencies for coastal management and decision making.  Management decisions
              would be informed by the use of multiple spaceborne, airborne, and in-situ
              remotely sensed measurements, spatio-temporal databases, and geospatial
              analysis tools.
