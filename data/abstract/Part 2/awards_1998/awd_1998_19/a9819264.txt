Abstract    :
              This project will measure the flux of the calcareous phytoplankter Florisphaera
              profunda in sediment traps from the Arabian Sea and compare the results with
              surface and downcore sediment data.  Data will be used to test the hypothesis
              that relative abundance of this species is a tracer for primary production. 
              The temporal and spatial variability across the upwelling system will allow
              comparison of species abundance to a wide range of conditions of upper-ocean
              structure and productivity.
