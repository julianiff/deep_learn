Abstract    :
              The proposed research explores the relationship between patterns of civic
              engagement, levels of social capital, and the process of democratization within
              Moscow.  The project is framed around three related questions: i) what is the
              character and intensity of civic engagement in contemporary Moscow?; ii) is the
              level and breadth of civic engagement expanding?; and iii) are contemporary
              forms of civic engagement promoting democratic values?  Civic engagement is
              participation in, and knowledge of, formal and informal modes of political and
              social interaction.  Data for the project will derive from a door-to-door
              survey of 3,500 households as well as in-depth interviews conducted with local
              officials and social activists.  We will explore the relationships between
              personal characteristics, attitudes/beliefs, material well-being, and housing
              status to understand variations in the level and scope of civic engagement. 
              Data from the project will deepen the empirical analysis of democratization in
              the Russian capital and gauge the prospects for democratic consolidation across
              Russia.  It will provide answers to key issues. Can democracy survive without
              well-developed reserves of social capital and are particular modes of civic
              engagement capable of generating new stocks of social capital?  Can grassroots
              civic engagement provide a sustainable foundation for the formal democratic
              institutions legislated 'from above' in Russia?  Research for the project will
              be carried out by a collaborative team of scholars representing the University
              of Colorado, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Moscow State University.
