This award to University of Minnesota will provide equipment
              in support of research on R/V Blue Heron, a research vessel operated by the
              university to study the Great Lakes. Specific equipment to be acquired includes
              a navigation system (GPS), instrumented sheaves, a portable winch, a radar
              unit, an intercom system, a radio and antenna, and immersion suits and work
              suits.   The shared-use equipment supported here will assist marine scientists
              conduct studies from R/V Blue Heron in  the Great Lakes region during 1999 and
              future years.
