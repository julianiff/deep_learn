This research seeks to improve
              the agreement between the observational properties and theoretical
              understanding of novae, recurrent novae and some types of symbiotic binary
              stars. Efforts to improve the computed models will focus on incorporating a
              proper treatment of the nuclear physics (i.e. b-limited CNO cycle reactions),
              convective motions at the peak of the explosion, and spatial distribution of
              the ejecta.  The objective is to achieve a better agreement with the observed
              light and radial velocity curves of three specific novae for which extensive
              observations are available.  A detailed understanding of these types of
              luminous stellar outbursts impacts areas outside the immediate field.  Such
              events contribute to the enrichment of the interstellar medium by heavy
              elements.  Their peak luminosities provide ways of calibrating the distances to
              structures within our Galaxy, and also to the extragalactic distance scale.
