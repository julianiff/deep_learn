Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation of the total amount, timing, and history of
              motion across diffuse plate boundaries in the Indian Ocean.  The project will
              analyze 20 distinct magnetic anomalies to assess the motion between the
              Capricorn and Australian plates, and anomalies 5, 6, and 13 to measure the
              motion of the Nubian plate relative to the Samalia plate.  The work will
              enhance knowledge of the amount, rate, timing, and distribution of deformation
              of oceanic lithosphere, of the limits to plate rigidity, and of the response of
              lithosphere in the Indian Ocean to high stresses.
