Abstract    :
              Taylor, Brian/U. Hawaii					
Proposal #: 98-19803

This proposal requests
              funds for scientific instrumentation required aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 280'
              research vessel operated by the University and owned by the Navy. In 1999, the
              National Science Foundation will support approximately 95 days of research on
              the ship. The research will be conducted primarily in the Northeast and Central
              Pacific.  The MOANA WAVE will be retired in mid-1999, but the marine technical
              support group at the University of Hawaii will continue to support NSF-funded
              researchers aboard another vessel, possibly the KOK.  The instrumentation
              requested includes a Guildline salinometer, a CTD with an optical package,
              in-situ nutrient analyzers, and a proton precession magnetometer.  This
              instrumentation is necessary to support the scientific programs assigned to the
              ship.
