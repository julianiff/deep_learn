Abstract    :
              In the project combined Global Positioning System satellite and undersea
              acoustic techniques will be used to study seafloor crustal deformation on the
              southeast flank of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii.. The subaerial portion of Kilauea
              is being monitored by an extensive network and continuous displacement rates of
              more than 10 cm/year have been measured on the southeast flank fault system. 
              The submerged portion of the southeast flank is an excellent site for
              application of seafloor geodetic techniques since it is a region of significant
              crustal deformation.  During the first year eight acoustic transponders will be
              deployed on bench marks, and the benchmarks re-occupied during the second and
              third year.
