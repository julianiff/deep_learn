The recommended project will develop and deploy two
              wireline-deployable, new-generation instrumented borehole seals (Circulation
              Obviation Retrofit Kits or CORKs) that will integrally contain instrumented
              multi-packers.  These integrated systems will be fully deployable and
              recoverable by the Marine Physical Lab, Scripps Institution of Oceanography
              wireline Control Vehicle, making installation and recovery of these
              next-generation CORKs possible by ships of convenience rather than the ODP
              drillship JOIDES Resolution.  These two systems will be installed within Hole
              504B and the nearby Hole 896A to measure in-situ hydrogeological fluid flow and
              processes within the upper oceanic crust on the south flank of the Costa Rica
              Rift.  Development of this wireline system fulfills the two principle
              recommendations for future CORK  development proposed by the December, 1997
              JOI/USSP-sponsored workshop on "Advanced CORKs"- that of 1) independent sealing
              and monitoring of multiple formations zones; and 2) maximizing wireline access
              to sealed boreholes.
