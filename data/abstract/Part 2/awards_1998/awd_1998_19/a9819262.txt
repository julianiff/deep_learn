Title:
              Late Holocene Decadal-to Century-scale Climate Variability in the Tropical
              Atlantic as Recorded in the Cariaco Basin

This award supports an integrated
              study to extend as existing record of decadal-to century-scale climate and
              ocean variability in the Caribbean/western Atlantic back 2000 years as recorded
              in the varved, high-deposition rate sediments of the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela. 
              The Cariaco Basin sediment record represents one of the very few marine
              records, if not the only record, in the Atlantic which has the potential to
              provide continuous, near-annually dated records of tropical climate and ocean
              variability which span the last 2000 years.  The sediments of the Cariaco Basin
              provide the opportunity to examine a variety of climate variables (e.g., trade
              wind intensity, ITCZ fluctuations, seasonal sea surface temperatures, etc.),
              and to explore how these variables interact and respond to external forcing
              mechanisms such as variations in the thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic
              and insolation changes on decadal to century time-scales.  Paleoenvironmental
              time-series produced by this project will provide a critical regional data set
              for a large and poorly understood area of the tropical Atlantic that can be
              used to interpret current climate observations and to test and validate
              numerical models of global climate change.
