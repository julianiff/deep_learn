Abstract    :
              This program will utilize some new techniques for predicting the fluxes of
              relativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbit.  This is an important topic in
              Space Weather because energetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit at the
              "killer electrons" that are capable of damaging or disabling satellites that
              are place in geostationary orbit.  This program will first create a large
              database on electron fluxes derived from a variety of DoE, NASA, and NOAA
              satellites.  These data will be combined with data on the solar wind,
              magnetospheric data and ground-based data to produce a correlated database for
              empirical studies.  Mapping functions will then be developed that will
              transform observations made at an arbitrary local time to local noon.  Time
              series of noon-time fluxes can then be used with a variety of prediction
              techniques, such as linear predictive filters and neural networks to produce a
              new predictive capability for the fluxes
