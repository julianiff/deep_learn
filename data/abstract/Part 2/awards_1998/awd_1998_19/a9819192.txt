In  this project, the PI will investigate ventilation in the 
              North Pacific thermocline,  specifically  the  origin  of  the  shallow
              subsurface maxima in the concentration of Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). The CFC
              data collected during the hydrographic program of the World Ocean  Circulation 
              Experiment (WOCE)  will  be  used  to  map  the locations of these maxima,
              against both depth and density in  order to  identify the spatial structure of
              this feature.  WOCE data will be  compared  to  pre-WOCE  CFC sections to 
              observe  the  temporal evolution of the CFC maxima.  Adding to the data
              analysis,  a  two-pronged modeling approach will be employed, beginning with a
              simple advective/diffusive model, after which a more sophisticated general
              circulation  model  would  be used to  study  the  origin  of  this feature, 
              as well as what can be inferred about the ventilation  of the main
              thermocline.
