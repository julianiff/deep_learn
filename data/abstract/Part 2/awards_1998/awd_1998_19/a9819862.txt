This award to University of Rhode Island will provide equipment
              in support of oceanographic research on R/V Endeavor, a research vessel
              operated by the university's Graduate School of Oceanography as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              equipment to be acquired includes a replacement tube for the vessel's
              rigid-hull inflatable boat, replacement computers for the ship's bridge,
              replacement of half the vessel's survival suits, and a camcorder for
              documenting shipboard operations.   The shared-use equipment supported here
              will enhance operations and safety on the vessel, and assist marine scientists
              conduct studies from R/V Endeavor, particularly in the Northwest Atlantic
              Ocean, during 1999 and future years.
