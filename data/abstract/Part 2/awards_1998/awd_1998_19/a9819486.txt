This is a five-year project engaging science teachers in
              cutting-edge research at Department of Energy National Laboratories and at
              universities across the nation.  During the lifetime of the project 60
              universities and laboratories from 28 states will participate.  Each summer 24
              lead teachers, two from each of 12 "university science centers" will hold
              8-week summer research appointments at Fermilab. At Fermilab they will work
              under the guidance of a physicist from a university or laboratory near their
              homes. All of the research will focus on research related to Fermilab and CERN
              experiments.  The following year these lead teachers and their mentor
              physicists will lead a year-long research program at each of the 12 centers for
              up to 10 local associate teachers.  These local programs include two
              components:  a 3-week research experience, and ongoing communications via
              e-mail and a website.  The website is the basic starting point for transfer to
              the classroom of the research experiences and access to near real time data. 
              It is expected that teachers will add to the website through adapting datasets
              to their needs and developing online experiments.  QuarkNet and the high-energy
              particle physics collaborations are committed to maintaining these centers and
              the accompanying 8-week summer research experience through the 15 years of the
              high energy particle physics experimental program with research and related
              sources of funding.
