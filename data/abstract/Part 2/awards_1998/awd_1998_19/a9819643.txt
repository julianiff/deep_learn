Over a five-year period this project will provide 490, K-8
              teachers in 28 schools and 7 school districts with 112-200 hours of
              professional development for each teacher.  The seven districts involved are
              Spearfish, Douglas, New Underwood, Kadoka, Lead-Deadwood, Belle Fourche and
              Wall. The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will also deliver teacher
              inservice and facilitate the involvement of scientists in the project. 
              Collaboration with the tribal colleges will help the project serve the needs of
              Native American students. 

A professional development school model serves as
              the basis for teacher professional development.  Teams composed of on-site lead
              teachers, pre-service teachers, scientists, science educators, administrators
              and parents will establish an on-going multi level support system for the
              improvement of science education. 

The Center of Excellence in Mathematics
              and Science Education at BHSU will provide the necessary space, staff, travel
              money and materials to refurbish the FOSS instructional materials as well as to
              provide resources to the teachers.
