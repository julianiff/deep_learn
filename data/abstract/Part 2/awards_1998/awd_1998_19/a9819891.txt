Abstract    :
              Specification of the ionospheric electric fields at high latitudes is of
              critical importance for both the research and operational components of the
              National Space Weather Program.  This study of high-latitude electric fields
              will address that topic by utilizing information on the distribution of auroral
              luminosity in the mapping of convection patterns.  This will be the first time
              that convection patterns have been extensively calibrated against auroral
              patterns.  The study will result in a new type of statistical convection model
              and significant improvements in the mapping of instantaneous convection
              patterns.  The new convection model and the arc-referencing technique will be
              added to the SuperDARN global mapping analysis.  The ramifications of using the
              improved convection mapping to study space weather effects will be explored. 
              All of the databases, models, and results arising from the work will be made
              available to the community via user-friendly interfaces at the JHU/APL
              SuperDARN Web site.
