This five-year proposal will promote the effective teaching of
              standards-based science by emphasizing knowledge, content, and the application
              of techniques in molecular biology and ecology.  The project will build a
              bridge between molecular biology and ecology, two fields that lie at opposite
              ends of the continuum of biological organization (not to mention opposite ends
              of biology textbooks and school year curricula).  Each year twelve pairs of
              teachers (from school districts identified by the Appalachian Rural Systemic
              Initiative) will participate in a three-week summer workshop at Miami
              University, where they will learn applications of ecology and molecular biology
              to the field of conservation biology, science teaching methods, and leadership
              skills.  During the following academic year teachers will have follow-up
              activities through access to a web-based, yearlong workshop and a two-day
              workshop before regional NSTA meetings.  Teachers will engage students in a
              capstone research project, which tests the hypothesis that habitat
              fragmentation reduces the genetic diversity of wind-pollinated trees.  The
              results of the study will lead to a publication in a refereed scientific
              journal.
