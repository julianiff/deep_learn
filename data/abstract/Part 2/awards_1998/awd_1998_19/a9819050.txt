Abstract    :
              This project will analyze stable isotopes in planktic and benthic foraminifera
              at intervals of 3000-5000 years in ODP sites with continuous recovery spanning
              the Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  This time represents an interval of unusually
              warm global climate, and incorporates at least one dramatic decrease in a 13 C,
              which has been postulated to indicate massive release of gas hydrates with
              global warming resulting from input of methane into the atmosphere.  The
              project will (a) determine whether there were several 13 C events, (b) assess
              the relationship of these events to an evolutionary turnover in marine
              microorganisms which occurred about 0.5 m.y. later and (c) determine whether
              there is evidence for precission-driven climate cycles that can be used to
              improve age-control estimates.
