This project will conduct a two-year study to address the
              following topics in mathematics learning:  provide a definition of "successful
              mathematics learning;" provide information on how research can guide
              mathematics education; describe the status of U.S. students' mathematical
              knowledge and understanding; identify critical junctures in childrens'
              mathematics understanding; and make recommendations for improvement in
              mathematics teaching and learning.  In addition to the research report, a more
              popular report will be produced and disseminated to parents, policymakers,
              teachers and the media.

The study will be conducted using the traditional
              NAS approach of naming a study committee.  The committee will be comprised of
              approximately 15 individuals and will include a wide range of expertise,
              including mathematicians, K-12 educators, researchers and psychologists. 
              Oversight will be provided by Dr. Rodger Bybee, Director of the CMSEE.  A
              "Virtual Commission" will provide additional oversight.  The commission will be
              responsible for developing an outline for the study, along with the
              identification of specific tasks on the timeline.  It is anticipated that the
              study commission itself will meet five times over the life of the project.
