Abstract    :
                This project is a preliminary study that will lay the groundwork for a larger
              research program concerning the role of self-produced locomotion on spatial,
              cognitive, and emotional development in infancy.  The research program will
              require a `mobility device` (MD) that assists infants in ambulating before they
              are maturationally able to crawl.  The preliminary study will explore possible
              designs for the MD and assess the level of proficiency infants can attain with
              such a device.  The major objectives are (1) to quantify the locomotor
              proficiency in the MD and in subsequent crawling of infants trained in
              self-produced locomotion; (2) to compare infants' performance on devices that
              do and do not require limb movements for propulsion; and (3) to obtain
              preliminary data on the relation between locomotor proficiency and type of
              locomotion on the one hand, and spatial, cognitive, and emotional changes on
              the other.  The results of the study, and especially the subsequent research
              program, should add to our understanding of the important role played by
              self-generated movement in development of infants' ability to perceive and
              interact with their environments.
