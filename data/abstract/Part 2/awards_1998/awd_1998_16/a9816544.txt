Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will allow the
              Chemistry Department at American University to purchase a Nd:YAG pumped dye
              laser. Junior faculty member Charles D. Pibel will be the primary user of this
              instrument, which will allow him to perform cavity ringdown laser absorption
              spectroscopy (CRLAS) studies of a triplet state molecule, and to probe
              molecular alignment and orientation. The laser will also be used in an
              undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory as a teaching tool to introduce
              laser fundamentals and spectroscopy. 

Lasers are light sources that have
              many uses in chemistry research.  They can be used in experiments to learn
              about the structure of molecules and unstable free radicals, and to examine
              detailed molecular properties that can have important ramifications for
              materials science and biology.  Also serving as educational tools, lasers can
              perform effectively as instruments in undergraduate teaching laboratories.
