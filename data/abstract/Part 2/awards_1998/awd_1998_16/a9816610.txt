Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed three-year research program are to investigate
              the products, kinetics, and mechanisms of secondary aerosol formation from the
              reactions of selected biogenic hydrocarbons (the monoterpenes b-pinene,
              limonene, myrcene, and linalool, the sesquiterpene b-caryophyllene, and
              dimethyl sulfide) with the important atmospheric oxidants OH, O3, and NO3.
              Reactions will be carried out in an environmental chamber and measurements will
              include real-time particle analysis using a thermal desorption particle beam
              mass spectrometer (TDPBMS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and scanning
              mobility spectrometer. In the TDPBMS, particles in the size range of
              approximately 0.01-0.5 mm are sampled into a differentially-pumped vacuum
              chamber, focused into a narrow, low-divergence particle beam using aerodynamic
              lenses, impacted/vaporized on a heated surface, and the vapor is mass analyzed
              using a quadrupole mass spectrometer.  In addition to the chamber studies,
              atmospheric particles will be collected from forested and agricultural areas in
              California and analyzed to determine if organic compounds identified in
              laboratory reactions are also present in ambient particles.  The results of
              these studies will help to elucidate the fundamental chemical processes
              involved in atmospheric secondary aerosol formation from biogenic hydrocarbons.
               The data will help to improve current understanding of the fate of atmospheric
              organic particles and their potential effects on Earth's radiation balance,
              atmospheric chemistry and visibility, and human health, and will be useful in
              determining the atmospheric lifetimes and fates of biogenic organic compounds.
