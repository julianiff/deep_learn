The first American Association of Rock Mechanics (ARMA)
              Forum, to be held in October, 1998, will be structured to encourage invited
              speakers and members of ARMA to explore and exchange ideas on possible new
              opportunities and directions for the rock mechanics research in the United
              States.  The Forum will emphasize panel discussions, and will feature small,
              productive discussion groups.  Participants will have a major role in
              developing the Forum report.  The report will focus on 1) a strategic vision
              for the future of rock mechanics in the United States, 2) the identification
              and delineation of critical issues facing the rock mechanics community, 3) the
              role of research in addressing these issues, and 4) critical areas of research
              in each of the Forum topic areas, including examples of specific research
              initiatives.  The Forum topic areas include:  weak rock engineering, fractured
              media, uncertainty and scaling, geophysical imaging and remote measurements,
              catastrophic rock failure, fluids and rocks, and the research roles of
              government, industry and universities, tying in future initiatives to the
              economic concerns of industry and society.
