Successful fertilization and production of viable offspring
              in fish is determined by a number of factors.  Important is the transfer of
              large numbers of highly motile, viable sperm to the female fish or to the eggs
              deposited into the water.  The objectives of the present proposal are to
              investigate the structure and function proteins in fluids of a cartilaginous
              fish species which increase sperm motility and relax these fish's uterine
              smooth muscle.  Specific goals are to: 1) Characterize the relaxation response
              of the fish uterine smooth muscle to the newly purified "raylaxin" molecule in
              male reproductive fluids and to isolate and characterize its receptor in the
              cell membrane of the uterine cells.  2) Identify and characterize the sperm
              stimulatory molecules in the fluids secreted over the fish sperm at the time of
              mating.  Analytical chemistry techniques and microscopy will be used to achieve
              these goals.  The results of these studies should have practical application in
              fisheries' management as well as contribute to the knowledge of basic
              biological mechanisms of reproduction.
