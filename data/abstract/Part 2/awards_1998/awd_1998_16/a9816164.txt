Abstract    :
              Hartland is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to examine
              ultrafast dynamics in confined systems.  Three projects that relate to this
              central theme will be carried out. In the first project, the particle size
              dependence to electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in nanometer sized
              gold and silver particles will be investigated.  These studies aim to determine
              how the time constants for these processes vary with a particle size. Next, the
              dynamics of trapped electrons in titanium oxide semiconductor particles will be
              examined via laser pump-probe techniques, to learn about the timescale for
              thermalization of hot electrons in the titanium dioxide conduction band.
              Finally, the solvation and non-adiabatic relaxation dynamics of electrons in
              reverse micelles will be studied, to determine directly how solvent motions
              depend on the water pool size in the reverse micelle. 

The gold and silver
              nanoparticles that will be studied in this project form the building blocks of
              nanoscale electronics devices that may provide the next generation of
              microelectronics circuits.  Understanding their size-dependent behavior is an
              important consideration for the development of these devices. The studies of
              reverse micelles can provide insights that will improve the understanding of
              water pockets in biological systems.
