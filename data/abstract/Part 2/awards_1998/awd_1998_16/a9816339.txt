Abstract    :
              With this New award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Mark S. Meier, and his collaborators Drs. H. Peter Spielmann
              and Robert C. Haddon in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Kentucky.   The research aims to understand the reactivity of fullerene and its
              derivatives - using a combination of synthesis, 13C NMR of isotopically
              enriched compounds, and computational methods - to find correlations between
              site reactivity and NMR parameters for individual carbon atoms.

The research
              will help to provide a basic theoretical understanding of the reactivity of an
              important class of organic compounds called fullerenes, so named because the
              basic building block of 60 carbon atoms has the same structure as the geodesic
              domes designed by the architect Buckminster Fuller.   Compounds of this type
              are being investigated by many scientists for potential applications ranging
              from electronic materials and sensors to pharmaceuticals.   The work will
              provide excellent training for the students involved in the areas of organic
              synthesis, theory, and spectroscopy.
