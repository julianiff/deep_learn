Many features of ecological
              systems are influenced by the life-history traits of the organisms that occur
              with them.  This research project will examine links between a key life-history
              stage, dormancy, and a series of ecological features of habitats where it can
              play an important role in controlling the occurrence and influence of
              organisms.  Dormancy is a  important factor in the life histories of freshwater
              zooplankton species.  This collaborative research project will examine the
              functional role of diapause in the existence of a key zooplankton genus,
              Daphnia, and the influence of its occurrence on other components of
              lake-plankton systems.  It will allow plankton food-web studies to go beyond
              their typical year-by-year basis to take a longer term perspective.  It will
              test specifically whether there is a trade off between investments in dormancy
              and the persistence of active stages for specific lakes and daphnid
              populations.  This project will develop a multi-year perspective that links
              life-history theory on dormancy to trophic dynamics with the context of a
              natural gradient of habitat permanence.
