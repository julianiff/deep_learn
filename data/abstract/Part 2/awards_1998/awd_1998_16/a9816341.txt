Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse, Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, is 
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division to develop metal mediated reactions of nitrous oxide
              and related species. Synthetic methods will be developed for oxygen, sulfur,
              and imido group transfer reactions using nitrous oxide, orgnoazides, and
              related species. These studies will focus on the late transition metals chosen
              so that reductive elimination reactions will result in the clean formation of
              cyclic organic molecules that contain oxygen or nitrogen heteroatoms. Systems
              will be constructed in which the metal catalyzes these transformations. Novel
              insertion reactions of sulfur atoms into late transition metal-carbon bonds
              will be devised. 

One of today's greatest chemical challenges is the
              selective oxidation of organic substrates. A very attractive oxidant is nitrous
              oxide, a molecule which liberates only nontoxic and environmentally friendly
              nitrogen gas after it serves as an oxygen transfer agent. Moreover, nitrous
              oxide is recognized as both a `greenhouse gas` and a stratospheric `ozone
              depleter`; it would be advantageous to find new uses for this gas, which is now
              an underutilized biproduct of the chemical industry. In this project metal
              systems will be designed to activate nitrous oxide toward oxygen atom transfer
              reactions and metal catalysts will be developed to facilitate these reactions.
              As a result new uses for nitrous oxide and some related species will be
              developed.
