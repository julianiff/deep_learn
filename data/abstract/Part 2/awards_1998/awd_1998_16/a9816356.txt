Abstract    :
              With this New RUI award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program is supporting the work of Dr. Ursula Simonis of San Francisco
              State University. The project combines two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance spectroscopy, computational chemistry, and X-ray crystallography to
              provide a quantitative description of, and the factors that affect the electron
              spin density delocalization in hemeproteins. The results will permit
              assignments of hyperfine-shifted resonances of paramagnetic iron porphyrins and
              allow a prediction of the most likely mechanisms of reactions at the heme
              periphery.

The results from this project  will be of interest to
              applications in the related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) field and to
              health-related research. Master's students and a large number of undergraduate
              students from under-represented groups will be involved in these studies. The
              project will provide hands-on access to sophisticated scientific
              instrumentation, and will give these students a valuable educational experience
              to prepare them to meet the challenges they will face in a very competitive
              workforce arena or in the pursuit of further education to the Ph.D. level.
