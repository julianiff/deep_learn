This award provides funds to permit Dr. Roy H. Wilkens,
              Hawaii Institute of Geophysics, University of Hawaii, to pursue with Dr.
              Soo-Chul Park, Department of Oceanography, Chungnam National University, Korea,
              for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on acoustic properties of
              fine-grained gas-bearing sediments off the southeast coast of the Korean
              peninsula.  Acoustic turbidity caused by gas bubbles in seafloor sediments is a
              common occurrence worldwide, but it is as yet poorly understood.  Even minute
              traces of gas in sediments that do not exhibit acoustic turbidity can slow
              compressional wave velocity to such an extent as to influence the conversion of
              two-way seismic travel time to depth.

The upper 10 meters of the seafloor
              contain the largest gradients in physical and acoustic properties in the
              sediment-seawater system.  Within this zone porosity may change by 20-30% (1.0
              to 0.7) and density may vary by 50% (1.02-1.50 gm/cc).  Compressional wave
              velocities usually change very little, remaining close to that of water, so
              that acoustic impedance changes and reflector positions are dictated by
              inflections in the density profile within this 10 meter layer.  One exception
              to this general rule is when gas is present in sediment pore fluids.  The PI
              has made measurements on the velocity of sound in gas-bearing sediment in the
              Baltic Sea, while his Korean collaborator is conducting such studies along the
              southeast coast of the Korean Peninsula.  The present award will allow the PI
              to visit Korea for joint planning and subsequent cooperative research, aboard
              Korean research vessels, to investigate in great detail the behavior of various
              properties above and within this near seafloor gassy sediment zone.  The
              scientific programs of both collaborators are expected to benefit greatly from
              the combination of measuring techniques and blending of expertise of the two
              research groups.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
              on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
