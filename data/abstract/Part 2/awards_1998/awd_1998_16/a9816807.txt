This project will attempt the first measurements of turbulence
              in the upper ocean boundary layer under a hurricane. Three Lagrangian floats,
              modified for air-deployment, will be dropped ahead of hurricanes during the
              1999 hurricane season in the southeastern U.S.. The floats will measure the
              vertical excursions and temperature of water parcels in the boundary for 1 to 2
              days and realy the data back via satellite. The work will be done cooperatively
              with scientists at the University of Miami, the National Hurricane Center and
              NOAA's Hurricane Research Division funded under the US Weather Research Program
              by NSF and NOAA.
