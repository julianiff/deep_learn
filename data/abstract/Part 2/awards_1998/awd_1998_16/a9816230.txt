Abstract    :
              9816230  Cheney  The objective of this project is to provide a bioprocess
              technology base for the cultivation of suspension cultures derived from red
              macroalgae in bioreactor systems, and to determine if these culture systems can
              be manipulated to produce secondary metabolites.  Specific objectives are to: 
              (1) develop cell and tissue suspension culture systems for red macroalgae which
              produce novel secondary metabolites, including Agarhiella subulata and Ochtodes
              secudiramea, with a secific focus on the development of rapidly growing
              microplantlet suspension cultures; (2) identify the process engineering factors
              that limit the growth kinetics of microplantlet suspension cultures of red
              macroalgae in photobioreactor systems; and (3) consider medium feeding
              strategies to alter production of secondary metabolites in microplantlet
              suspension cultures of red macroalgae with specific focus on the bromination of
              terpenoids by microplantlet cultures of Ochtodes secudiramea as a model system.
