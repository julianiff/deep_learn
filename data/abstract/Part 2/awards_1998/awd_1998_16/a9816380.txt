Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Mary Jane Shultz at Tufts University will use
              surface-specific sum frequency generation (SFG) to study photooxidation
              reactions on heterogeneous surfaces in order to identify the nature and
              location of reactive species.  Amines and alcohols, which are known to
              photooxidize at heterogeneous surfaces, will be examined on three substrates,
              nanostructured TiO2; TiO2 codeposited with SnO2, WO3, or CdO; and coupled-oxide
              substrates capped with TiO2, in order to elucidate the surface chemistry.  SFG
              will also be used to investigate a layered growth technique on quartz.  A
              fundamental understanding of parameters affecting hole transfer and target
              binding is applicable to numerous interfacial charge-transfer processes. 
              

Electron transfer at heterogeneous surfaces plays a central role in
              numerous processes and practical devices, including solar cells, components of
              modern electronics, and catalysts.  The materials being examined in this
              project are known for their ability to oxidize pollutants.
