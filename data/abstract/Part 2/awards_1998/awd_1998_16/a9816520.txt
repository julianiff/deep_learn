Abstract    :
              DODGE, Richard E.  OCE-9816520    SUMMARY    This SGER award will support travel
              to Cuba for reconnaissance of uplifted terraces believed to be Pleistocene reef
              complexes.  Mapping and preliminary sampling will be conducted, and geochemical
              scanning performed to determine the age of the material and its geochemical
              inintegrity.  If the reefs are dateable and not altered by diagenesis, they
              hold the potential to provide a record of past sea level and climate changes in
              the Caribbean.
