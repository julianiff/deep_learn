Abstract    :
              	This proposal is focused on the role of biogenic hydrocarbons in the removal of
              atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The oxidation of volatile organic carbon
              compounds (VOC's) yields organic peroxy radicals, which can react with NO to
              form stable organic nitrates.  For example, isoprene can react to produce
              isoprene nitrates, which are believed to be an important sink for NOx.  Organic
              nitrates derived from biogenic VOC's, including isoprene nitrate, have never
              been measured in ambient air.  This proposal involves: 1) development of new
              membrane inlet quadrupole ion trap methods to detect atmospheric nitrates, 2)
              field measurements of isoprene nitrates in Northern Michigan as part of the
              PROPHET study, and 3) laboratory measurement of the yields of organic nitrates
              from aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenes, and oxygenated VOC's.  The results of
              this research will be utilized to develop a better understanding of the
              influence of forests and associated biogenic emissions on tropospheric ozone.
