Abstract    :
              The Division of Educational System Reform (ESR) has supported the California
              systemic Initiatives Assessment Collaborative (CSIAC) since November, 1996. 
              The purpose of CSIAC is to help ESR-funded initiatives and other entities have
              access to and use high-quality, standards-based assessments in science.  The
              project has assembled an advisory panel that has helped in developing
              performance tasks, open-ended items and enhanced multiple choice items in
              aligning complete instruments that are aligned with the AAAS Benchmarks and the
              National Science Education Standards.  

CSIAC has conducted two large-scale,
              multi-state administrations (grades 5, 8, 10) of the instrument, in the spring
              of 1997 and 1998.  The test was available in English and Spanish
              versions.

The current proposal allows WestEd to respond to the extensive
              demand for 1998-1999 administration of the test, with the current complement of
              users and a significant number of other systems and organizations that have
              requested it.  These users currently pay the direct cost for the test.  WestEd
              uses NSF funds to pay for continued item development (so that tasks are not
              repeated); the advisory board function; data analysis, consultants, and
              travel.
