The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) is
              organizing three Regional Conferences on Mathematics Achievement that focus on
              ways of helping state and local school systems make better use of federal
              resources to improve student achievement in mathematics.  Each conference is
              held the day before the Department of Education's 1998 Regional Conference on
              Improving America's Schools (IAS), but has a distinct agenda and program
              leader.  The conferences support the Action Strategy developed by the
U.S. 
              Department of Education and the National Science Foundation as part of the
              President's initiative on improving mathematics education at the middle school
              level.
