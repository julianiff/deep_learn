Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

	The proposed research investigates how disease emerges in
              populations of salamanders in Arizona, is transmitted among individuals in
              populations, spreads across populations in a region, and finally, via natural
              selection, may alter salamander life history.  Three hypotheses will be tested.
               Within a habitat, animals, soil, or water harbor viruses and environmental
              changes initiate infections by stimulating pathogen growth or weakening host
              salamanders.  Alternatively, salamanders in a habitat are susceptible and
              disease is introduced from elsewhere.  Experiments and field observations will
              evaluate the roles of salamanders, invertebrates, cows, birds, or humans as
              possible reservoirs of disease or vectors dispersing virus.  Finally, disease
              selects against cannibalism, accounting for regional variation in salamander
              life history.  
	The virus-vector-tiger salamander system is ideal for testing
              models in disease ecology.  Arizona populations are well-studied, the principal
              viral pathogen is known, infections are frequent, and all habitats for one
              endangered subspecies where disease is common can be sampled.  In the last
              fifteen years some species of amphibians have declined steadily, even to
              extinction, and pathogens are a possible cause.  This research will advance our
              understanding of pathogens as a factor in amphibian declines; a key example of
              the general loss of biodiversity.  Proposed experiments and observations
              incorporate experts in ecology, evolution, pathology, virology, and molecular
              genetics.  Vertically-integrated field and laboratory experiments will untangle
              complex interactions from molecular genetics to population biology to test
              general models of disease ecology.
