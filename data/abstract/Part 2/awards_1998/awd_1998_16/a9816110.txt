This trilateral workshop, planned for November 1998 in
              Shanghai, will bring together key members of the civil infrastructure systems
              communities of China, Japan and the United States to determine specific goals
              and define and identify joint research projects and full-scale implementation
              of technological advances in civil infrastructure.  An important product of
              this joint workshop will be development of a plan for comprehensive civil
              infrastructure and hazard mitigation research programs for China and for
              U.S.-China cooperation.
