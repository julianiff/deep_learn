Abstract: This award furnishes support for an international
              conference on singular and oscillatory integrals to be held on the campus of
              the University of Wisconsin-Madison from January 7 to January 11, 1999. The
              funds will be used to cover travel and local expenses of the principal speakers
              as well as to support travel and local expenses of  other participants. The
              meeting will focus mainly on Fourier and oscillatory  integral operators,
              singular Radon transforms, oscillatory integrals, and their applications to
              partial differential  equations.

Harmonic analysis, the subject of this
              conference, has historically had and continues to have a major impact in
              various areas of mathematics and its applications. Its methods have been
              applied in partial differential equations, probability, complex analysis,
              mathematical physics, and integral geometry. Harmonic analysis has also had a
              crucial role to play in the dramatic developments that recent years have
              witnessed in such concrete areas as numerical analysis, tomography, and image
              processing.
