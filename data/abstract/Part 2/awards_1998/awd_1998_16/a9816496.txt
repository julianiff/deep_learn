Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF)/Junior Faculty Program will allow the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign to acquire a rapid scanning
              spectrophotometer with stopped-flow capability and a rapid freeze quench
              instrument.   This equipment will be used primarily by William van der Donk, a
              junior faculty member, for his research on mechanisms of enzymatic reactions;
              mechanistic studies of biosynthesis of antibiotics; and mechanistic
              investigations of tetrachloroethene dehalogenases.  

This technically
              advanced equipment will open up new research opportunities in many aspects of
              chemistry, including biomolecular chemistry and environmental chemistry.
