Abstract    :
              The adenylated dinucleotide Ap4A (P1,P4-diadenosine 5'-teptraphosphate) has been
              termed an "alarmone" to denote that it is synthesized by cells in response to
              metabolic challenges and stress and acts as a hormonal signal on other cells. 
              Specifically, Ap4A is stored in the dense granules of platelets and, when
              released, induces surrounding endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO),
              an important vasodilator.  The goal of this project is to define the
              biochemical mechanism of action of Ap4A in the target endothelial cells. Two
              fundamental questions will be addressed.  (1) What are the receptors that bind
              Ap4A to induce NO release?  (2) Which signaling pathways and intracellular
              mediators are activated in response to receptor binding?  The working
              hypothesis is that extracellular Ap4A binds to a membrane receptor that is
              specific for adenylated dinucleotides.  A transient elevation of intracellular
              calcium, triggered by receptor activation, promotes binding of calcium to
              calmodulin which in turn activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase.  The
              receptor will be characterized by studying the effects of various adenylated
              dinucleotides and purino-receptor antagonists and agonists of Ap4A induced NO
              release.  Rational drug design will be used to synthesize analogs of Ap4A. 
              These analogs should provide insight into the molecular architecture of the
              receptor binding site and will enhance efforts to design new agonists and
              antagonists specific for this receptor.  The role of intracellular calcium in
              signaling will be studied in cell populations and individual cells.  Specific
              inhibitors will be used to determine the possible roles of inositol phosphate
              activation of calcium release and calmodulin participation in NO synthesis. 
              The biochemical characterization of this important signal transduction cascade
              will provide fundamental new understanding of how adenylated dinucleotides act
              as important extracellular vasoregulators.
