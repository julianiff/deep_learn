Abstract    :
              The visual system of humans is very good at perceiving different levels of
              brightness in the appearance of objects in the environments, even under varying
              conditions of lighting.  Brightness perception of a single surface can be
              affected quite strongly by the brightness of nearby surfaces, as often shown by
              optical illusions.  A classic example of 'brightness induction' is when
              identical gray patches can be made to appear either brighter or darker
              depending on the brightness of the areas surrounding them.  Such brightness
              illusions show how different areas of the visual scene can interact in creating
              a visual stimulus.  We still do not understand the mechanisms of lateral
              interactions underlying these perceptions, despite a number of theories over
              more than a century.  This work involves theoretical modeling and
              psychophysical measurements from human observers. A particular new model has
              been developed to account for a whole group of visual effects, including some
              novel brightness configurations.  The model now incorporates non-linearities in
              visual responses and rules for combinations, and is tested for validity by how
              well the perceptual results fit the predictions.
   These results quantifying
              perceptual variations in brightness are very important for visual neuroscience,
              because they provide insights into how neurobiological networks of the eye and
              the visual cortex in the brain might produce conscious perceptions.  The impact
              also will extend beyond visual neuroscience to perceptual psychology, and could
              be important in the design of visual displays and in developing artificial
              visual systems.
