Abstract    :
              We know very little about the nature of color vision in vertebrate animals other
              than mammals.  Humans and some primates have three color pigments in the
              photoreceptor cells called cones, which are in the retina of the eye.  One of
              these pigments is fairly recently evolved from a gene duplication event.  The
              three pigments provide color vision that is called trichromatic.  Birds are one
              of the non-mammalian groups where many species have excellent color vision, but
              pigeons are the single species to have been extensive experimental subjects. 
              Birds have maintained four evolutionary ancient lineages of pigments, giving
              the potential for tetrachromatic color vision that extends into the ultraviolet
              (UV) region of the visual spectrum.  Birds are also unlike mammals in having
              cone cells that include colored oil droplets within them that can act as color
              filters, and represent another evolutionary elaboration.  This project uses
              quantitative behavioral testing to study color matches, hue saturation and
              wavelength discrimination by budgerigars, using narrow wavelength bands of
              light.  The results will address how UV cones participate in color vision, the
              relation between colored oil droplets and visual pigments, and where the peaks
              are for optimal wavelength discrimination.
   This comparative work will be
              important because color vision often has a major ecological role in
              communication and foraging.  The impact is likely to extend to how other
              multi-pigment color vision systems work in other animals including
              invertebrates, and this knowledge could be useful in aspects of molecular
              evolution, and in design of artificial visual sensors.
