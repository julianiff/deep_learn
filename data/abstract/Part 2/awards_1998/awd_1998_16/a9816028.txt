Abstract    :
              With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Michael P. Doyle at the University of Arizona.   The
              work builds on earlier results using asymmetric metal carbene transformations
              for intramolecular cyclopropanation and C-H insertion using chiral
              dirhodium(II) carboxamidate complexes to synthesize organic compounds difficult
              to make by other means.   He plans to increase the reactivity of the dirhodium
              catalysts by modifying the carboxamidate ligands, investigate double
              diastereoselection, carry out asymmetric ylide transformations, produce
              macrocyclic compounds with rings of up to 20 atoms, and determine the
              importance of ligand steric and electronic factors in determining catalyst
              yields and selectivities.

This work involves fundamental research in
              improved ways to synthesize chiral organic compounds using homogeneous
              catalysts with chiral ligands.   The methods are likely to be useful in the
              synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.   Dr. Doyle has helped
              to train 23 undergraduate students in the past five years, in a unique
              arrangement in which they work with postdoctoral students in Dr. Doyle's
              laboratory.
