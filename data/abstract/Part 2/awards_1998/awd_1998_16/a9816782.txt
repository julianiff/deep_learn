Abstract    :
              The pineal gland lies in the brain of vertebrate animals and is involved in
              detecting light levels in the environment to regulate the circadian rhythm, or
              daily 'clock', of cyclic activity of an animal.  Cells in the pineal contain a
              protein molecule called pineal opsin (P-opsin), which is related to the
              photosensitive pigment in the eye, and is activated by light.  The P-opsin is
              believed to be the pigment that initiates light response in the pineal,
              including suppressing production of the hormone melatonin.  This project uses
              biochemistry on isolated chick pineal cells as a model system to identify other
              protein molecules called G-proteins, which are activated by light and P-opsin,
              and which, in turn, regulate melatonin production and entrainment of the pineal
              circadian clock.
    Results will help understand how molecular mechanisms in
              a single cell containing a photosensor, a rhythmic output, and an endogenous
              clock, can combine to provide an circadian oscillator, and will have an impact
              on the biology of rhythms as well as on neuroscience and cell biology.
