	This project supports the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from the University of Virginia, studying the change
              in the culture of the US military brought about  by changes in gender and
              marital roles in US society.  The student will study how the military is
              reacting to changes from the old system where officers were expected to be
              married and officers' wives were expected to provide vitally important but
              unpaid services to advance their husband's career, while enlisted men were
              expected to be unmarried.  In the contemporary military, officers and enlisted
              personnel are no longer all male; officers' wives may tend to pursue their own
              careers and be less willing to perform volunteer services for the military, and
              many enlisted personnel are married.  Using anthropological techniques of
              participant observation, structured long interviews and formal life history
              interviews, at two army bases focusing on one battalion at each base,  the
              student will examine the challenge and the personal as well as institutional
              response to changing gender and class roles.  This research is important
              because it will advance our understanding of how the military is coping with
              social change.  In addition it will help train a young social scientist.
