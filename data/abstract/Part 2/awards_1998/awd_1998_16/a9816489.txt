Abstract    :
              9816489  Giovannoni  This award to Oregon State University will provide a high
              resolution CCD camera for use in light microscopy investigation of SAR11
              bacteria and other extremely small bacterial plankton.  These organisms have
              recently been determined to be extremely abundant in sea water, but at present
              little is known about their distribution, seasonality, or role in the carbon
              cycle.  This camera provides an ability to document critical characteristics of
              these tiny organisms.  ***
