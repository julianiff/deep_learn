Abstract    :
              Dr. Richard Holz, Department of Chemistry, Utah State University is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division for an investigation of hydrolytic reactions catalyzed by
              dinuclear metal ion clusters. Specifically, Dr. Holz will elucidate the
              pathways of these reactions which are catalyzed by AAP (an aminopeptidase
              enzyme) with homo- and hetero-dinuclear metal clusters using a variety of
              spectroscopic and physical characterization techniques among which is
              time-resolved crystallography. The particular system chosen will serve both as
              a 'model" system and as a "real" system; this duality represents a truly
              state-of-the-art approach.

The significance of this work is to gain an
              understanding of how di- and tri-nuclear metallohydrogenase enzymes hydrolyze
              such highly relevant biological molecules as DNA, RNA, phospholipids and
              polypeptides. The study will also provide an answer as to why the nickel- and
              copper-AAP enzymes are hyperactive relative to the zinc-AAP enzyme. This will
              be of interest to the biological and medical community. Graduate students and
              post-doctoral associates will receive an excellent training in bioinorganic
              chemistry.
