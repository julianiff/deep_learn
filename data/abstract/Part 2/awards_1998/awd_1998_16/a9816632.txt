Abstract    :
              The American Association of Physics Teachers is holding a conference on October
              2 - 4, 1998, in Arlington, VA.  The conference will include 200 physicists,
              educators and other scientists who will discuss the future of undergraduate
              education in physics at two year colleges, four year colleges and universities.
               This conference builds on several prior and continuing efforts by AAPT, the
              American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics to assist
              physics departments to examine their curricula, the changing student body,
              evolving job requirements and career opportunities as well as accumulating
              research on student learning.  The products of the conference will be concrete
              action plans and guidelines that will help physics departments to undertake the
              kinds of revitalization that will benefit their students, their institutions,
              and the discipline.
