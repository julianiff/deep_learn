Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will allow the Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University to
              acquire a porosimeter for surface area and pore analysis of new organic
              polymers.  David Spivak, a junior faculty member whose research focuses on
              surface area and pore analysis of polymer materials, molecular control of
              architecture in macroporous materials, and preparation of cross-linked
              oligosaccharide/dimethacrylate hybrid materials, will be the primary user of
              this equipment.  

This research involves the synthesis of crosslinked
              network polymeric materials.  These materials form very small pores and have
              many uses in separations science.  Thus, the data that Spivak will generate
              will have a high impact on the development of new materials for high
              performance liquid chromatography and enantioselective separations.
