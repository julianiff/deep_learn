Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will allow the Chemistry Department at Purdue University to purchase a
              size-exclusion chromatography system.   This instrument is to be used primarily
              by Alexander Wei, a junior faculty member, whose research focuses on
              preparatory organic synthesis of cyclic oligoanilines and cycloaniline-based
              catenated polymers; and the synthesis and solid-state structure of
              conformationally modified carbohydrates.  

Size exclusion chromatography,
              also known as gel permeation chromatography, is a well-established technique
              for the analytical separation and identification of organic and bio-organic
              materials.  It is also widely used for preparative separations, in which a
              particular chemical compound can be isolated from a mixture.  Chromatography is
              arguably one of the most powerful tools available to the synthetic chemist, and
              others.  The work supported here should have significant impact in the area of
              polymer chemistry.
