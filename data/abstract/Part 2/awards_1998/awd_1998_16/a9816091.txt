Collaborative Research: NO3-N Retention in
              Headwater Streams: Influences of Riparian Vegetation, Metabolism and Subsurface
              Process

Human activities have introduced massive quantities of nitrogen to
              both terrestrial and aquatic environments with detrimental effects on forests, 
              rivers, and estuaries.  Consequently, it is important to understand how and
              where natural processes retain and transform nitrogen as it moves across the
              landscape.  Our research will focus on how headwater streams function as sites
              for retention of nitrogen with emphasis on microbial processes that return
              nitrogen to the atmosphere. The program design compares headwater streams that
              differ in their terrestrial settings and the degree with which streams interact
              with groundwater.  Study sites in New Mexico, Tennessee, and North Carolina
              will be established to compare the influence of forest type (open or dense) and
              subsurface processes (streams on bedrock vs streams that exchange water with
              subsurface sediments) to assess how the biota of stream ecosystems effectively
              retain nitrogen and how these processes vary across the landscape.
