Collaborative Research: NO3-N Retention in Headwater Streams:
              Influences of Riparian Vegetation, Metabolism and Subsurface Process

Human
              activities have introduced massive quantities of nitrogen to both terrestrial
              and aquatic environments with detrimental effects on forests,  rivers, and
              estuaries.  Consequently, it is important to understand how and where natural
              processes retain and transform nitrogen as it moves across the landscape.  Our
              research will focus on how headwater streams function as sites for retention of
              nitrogen with emphasis on microbial processes that return nitrogen to the
              atmosphere. The program design compares headwater streams that differ in their
              terrestrial settings and the degree with which streams interact with
              groundwater.  Study sites in New Mexico, Tennessee, and North Carolina will be
              established to compare the influence of forest type (open or dense) and
              subsurface processes (streams on bedrock vs streams that exchange water with
              subsurface sediments) to assess how the biota of stream ecosystems effectively
              retain nitrogen and how these processes vary across the landscape.
