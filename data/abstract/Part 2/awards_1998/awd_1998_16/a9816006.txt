RUI: Longevity of tree-species effects on soil
              fertility and sustainability of second-rotation tropical tree plantations

In
              the tropics, vast areas of land formerly used for agriculture are being planted
              with fast-growing plantations of trees. The productivity of forest plantations
              depends on soil fertility, which can change substantially under the influence
              of different tree species. This project will examine the sustained productivity
              of short-rotation woody crop landscapes in Hawaii, with a specific focus on
              second-rotation impacts of soil nutrients. The investigators plan a series of
              robust experimental tests of the lingering effects of first rotation species on
              nutrient cycles and productivity during subsequent rotation. In addition, the
              project will consider the potential roles that different species may play in
              fostering the re-establishment of native forest species. The research is a
              joint effort of the University of Hawaii at Hilo, an undergraduate Title III
              minority institution, Colorado State University and the USDA Forest Service.
              This project will bring ecological science into the development of a new
              curriculum in tropical forestry at the University of Hawaii at Hilo and has the
              potential to provide useful information for tropical forestry management.
