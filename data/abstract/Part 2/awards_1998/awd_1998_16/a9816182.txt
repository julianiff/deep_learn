Abstract    :
              This research focuses on two related areas.  In one, the synthesis of furans and
              other five-membered ring aromatic heterocycles will be accomplished through the
              coupling of enyne-carbonyl compounds and Fischer carbene complexes.  In the
              second, tandem cycloaromatization and remote functionalization will be carried
              out via the coupling of conjugated enediynes with carbene complexes.  The
              compounds resulting from this approach are rich in functionality and a general
              synthetic method is thus offered that combines organometallic chemistry with
              radical chemistry.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. James W. Herndon of the Department of
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at New Mexico State University.  Professor Herndon
              will focus his work on developing new methodology for the preparation of
              substituted aromatic rings.  The methodology and the resulting products are of
              potential interest to the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
