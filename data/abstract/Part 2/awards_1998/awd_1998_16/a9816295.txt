Abstract    :
              This award to the department of anthropology at the University of Illinois will
              cover partial costs for training in ethnographic research methods. The funds
              will be used over a period of five years to insure that Ph.D. students in
              social/cultural anthropology who take a specified course of study in social
              scientific research design and methodology have fieldwork experience before
              they begin their Ph.D. research. This activity is important to improve the
              training of social scientists, so that the new cohort of social researchers
              will be capable of advancing our knowledge of contemporary problems as well as
              of basic research issues.
