                  Development of Conditionally Specified Statistical                   
              Models for Analysis of Environmental Studies    Abstract:      The objectives
              of this project are to formulate flexible multivariate  distributions having
              associated conditional distributions of varying  forms, develop statistical
              models from these distributions, and assess   the performance of such models in
              terms of their ability to describe  and predict environmental variables.  Such
              models are particularly  attractive for application to problems that involve
              spatially dependent  processes, such as concentrations of air pollutants and
              potentially  toxic substances in terrestrial settings.  These statistical
              methods  will improve our ability to describe such variables at monitored 
              locations and, in particular, produce accurate and precise predictions  for
              unmonitored locations.  Spatial and temporal averages of pollutants  that
              result will provide better assessment of environmental exposures   for use in
              models of human health impacts and ecological responses  to environmental
              conditions.
