Abstract    :
              James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his studies of spectroscopy and relaxation in
              liquids, supercritical fluids and proteins.  Three specific areas of research
              will be pursued: 1) the development of  integral equation theories of density
              and temperature anomalies of fluids near the critical point; 2) the extension
              of existing hybrid analytical / simulation techniques, developed for simple
              model systems, to the treatment of vibrational relaxation of polyatomic
              molecules in polyatomic solvents; and 3) an all-atom molecular dynamics
              simulation of the carbon monoxide myoglobin complex in water in order to
              compare directly with the experimental observables obtained from time-resolved
              vibrational experiments.

The dynamics of liquid solvents plays an important
              role in many chemical and biological processes.   Vibrational relaxation is
              also intimately involved in liquid-state chemical reaction dynamics.  Skinner's
              research attempts to provide a molecular level interpretation of the influence
              a solvent has on chemical and biological processes in condensed phases.
