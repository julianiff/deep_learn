Abstract    :
              9816085  Strong    The Bimathematics Instruction Framework is a staff
              development program which provides a set of tools (organizing principles) to
              help teachers reorganize instruction at their grade levels and vertically among
              grades within the school in a focused coherent manner.  A bimathematics Scope
              and Sequence serves as a guide for planning the instructional program around
              the organizing principles.  The Organizing Principles are:  (1) Some Key
              foundation Principles of Mathematics; (2) proportional Reasoning and
              Multiplicative Relationships; (3) Patterns, Functions, and Relations.  The
              Bimathematics Organizers are used to reorganize, compact, and condense the
              myriad of mathematics objectives in a typical mathematics curriculum into an
              effective, doable instructional program.  Instruction is addressed from a
              bimathematics point of view.  Bimathematics instruction is firmly rooted in the
              philosophy of the NCTM Standards and the findings and implications of the TIMMS
              Study.    Teachers are prepared to implement the program through 30 hours of
              instenisve training in the Bimathematics Framework.  Objectives addressed in
              the training are:  (1) mastery of the key organizers, (2) relating the
              bimathematics scope and sequence to instructional needs, (3) preparing to use
              the organizers in mathematics programs for the following year, (4) developing
              implementation plans, and (5) forming school support teams.  Trained
              teacher-mentors provide classroom assistance throughout the year.  These
              teacher-mentors assure that teachers actively implement what they have learned.
