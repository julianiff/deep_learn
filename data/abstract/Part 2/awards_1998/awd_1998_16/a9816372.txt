Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research on metal-mediated oxidation reactions by Dr. James M. Mayer
              of the Chemistry Department, University of Washington.  When nucleophiles,
              either from other sites in the complex or from other molecules, react with
              electrophilic oxo, nitrido, or imido ligands, the metal is formally reduced and
              the nucleophile is oxidized.  In these cases, the site of oxidation is the
              multiple bond between the metal and the ligand.  The goal of this research is
              to determine how the ligand electrophilicity can be tuned by changes at the
              metal center.  Oxidations of carbanions, boranes and alkenes will be studied
              and the reaction mechanisms determined.  New oxidants will be prepared,
              including osmium (VI)- and osmium (VIII)-oxo complexes.

Selective oxidation
              of organic compounds by transition metals is a critical step in the production
              of many commodity chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, and is gaining
              importance in waste treatment.  Understanding key reaction steps is needed to
              improve present technology.  This research is aimed at elucidating the
              chemistry of one class of such metal-mediated oxidation reactions.  Students at
              all levels will be involved in the research and will learn many different
              instrumental methods and practical laboratory skills.
