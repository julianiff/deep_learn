Abstract    :
              Sequence analysis of the rice genome is progressing at a  rapid pace.  To
              maximize the impact of the sequencing  project, scientists who will be the
              end-users of the  sequence information, that is, those who will link the 
              genome information to function at all biological levels,  including cellular,
              organismal, and evolutinary, must be  included in the effort.  To facilitate of
              the international  coordination of this broadened view of rice genomic research
               and the formation of international research collaborations,  this award
              provides funds to coordinate and support the  participation of 10-15 scientists
              from the USA to attend the  6th International Symposium on Rice Molecular
              Biology to be  held October 31-November 2, 1998 in Shanghai and Hangzhou, 
              China.  The scientific program for the Symposium includes a  comprehensive
              analysis of the rice genome, including  physical mapping and sequencing as well
              as gene regulation  and expression.  As many of the key Symposium speakers are 
              rice researchers from Asia (China, Japan, Philippines) and  the UK, this
              meeting provides an excellent opportunity for  US scientists working
              complementary and overlapping areas to  discuss potential collaborations and
              international research  coordination.  In additional to the formal sessions, an
               informal discussion forum will be schedule during the  Symposium where all
              interested scientists can voice their  ideas on future directions for rice
              research and suggest  strategies for the coordination and implementation of
              this  research.    US participants for the 6th Internal Symposium will be 
              selected to represent the breadth of rice research in the  USA.  A widely
              distributed electronic invitation will  solicit applications for participation
              from faculty, post  doctorals and graduate students currently involved in 
              research in rice molecular biology.
