Abstract    :
              The conference is to bring together the world leaders
of mathematicians with
              interests in nonlinear
partial differential equations.  We will focus on
              nonlinear 
elliptic equations, motions of surfaces, fluids dynamics  
and
              equations from mathematical physics.  We expect  
the meeting to be a place in
              which many discussions and 
collaborations are initiated.


Almost all
              physical phenomena, such as those in Quantum Mechanics,
Fluid Mechanics and
              Superconductivity, are described in mathematical
terms by partial differential
              equations.
One theory of high temperature superconductor can be described by
              
a nonlinear elliptic equation. Analysis of this equation
will lead us to a
              better understanding of the physical phenomena.
In the  last year of the 20th
              century, it is a good time to focus 
our minds on what we have accomplished
              and on new challenges
that will face us in the next century.  The aim of this
              conference is 
to review the progress and, more importantly, to discuss new
              challenges
and new applications of  nonlinear partial differential equations
