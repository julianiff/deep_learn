Abstract    :
              Gallie
           The 5'-leader (called  omega) of tobacco mosaic viral RNA
              functions as a translational enhancer.  Sequence analysis of a 102 kDa protein,
              previously identified as a specific omega RNA-binding protein, revealed
              homology to the HSP101 family and its expression in yeast complemented a
              thermotolerance defect caused by a deletion of the HSP104 gene.  Up to a
              20-fold increase in the translation of  omega-luc but not luc mRNA was observed
              in yeast expressing the tobacco HSP101 whereas omega failed to enhance
              translation in the absence of HSP101. Therefore, HSP101 and omega comprise a
              two-component translational regulatory mechanism that can be recapitulated in
              yeast.  Analysis of HSP101 function in yeast translation mutants suggested that
              the initiation factors eIF3 and eIF4G were required for the HSP101-mediated
              enhancement. The RNA-binding and translational regulatory activities of HSP101
              were inactive in respiring cells, following amino acid starvation, or during
              late-exponential/stationary growth, whereas its thermotolerance function
              remained unaffected. This has led to a model in which the function of HSP101 as
              a translational regulator requires activation of its RNA-binding activity which
              in turn is controlled by nutrient signaling.  The first goal of this project is
              to investigate how HSP101 functions as an RNA-binding protein by identifying
              the RNA-binding site through deletion and mutation analysis. The second goal
              will determine how its RNA-binding activity is regulated by nutrient
              availability.  
	This research seeks to understand how a protein that is
              induced in response to heat shock (HSP101) regulates the synthesis of tobacco
              mosaic virus proteins. Since the two components that are responsible for this
              regulation, an RNA sequence called omega and the tobacco HSP101 protein, are
              sufficient to recapitulate this regulation when expressed in yeast, this
              project will examine the role of HSP101 in binding to RNA and regulating
              translation in yeast. The project will further examine the regulation of HSP101
              function in yeast by nutrient availability. Thus, this research will increase
              our understanding of a mechanism that confers on plants the ability to regulate
              protein production.
