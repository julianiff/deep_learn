Abstract    :
              9816239  Yelle    Titan is the object in this solar system with an atmosphere
              most similar to that of Earth.  These atmospheres share similar composition and
              surface pressures, and we can recognize the same atmospheric regions on Titan
              that have been defined for Earth.  As a consequence, we can learn a great deal
              by comparing these bodies.  Dr. Roger Yelle's investigation is based on
              comprehensive calculations of atmospheric structure including radiative,
              dynamical, and chemical processes.  The focus is on the upper atmospheres. 
              Results for Earth and Titan will be directly comparable.  One outcome should be
              a better understanding of how the differences in size, gravity, rotation rate,
              and heliocentric distance affect global circulation.  The Titan calculations
              will be used to interpret Voyager observations of upper atmospheric temperature
              and composition, allowing answers to questions about the role of dynamics in
              the thermal structure, or horizontal transport to the chemistry, and the
              contribution of global wind systems to vertical transport.  Funding for this
              project is shared among the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of
              Atmospheric Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
