This planning grant is a collaborative effort between the
              Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine at the Hershey Medical Center
              (HMC) and the school districts of Derry Township, Harrisburg, Lower Dauphin,
              and West Perry.  The project capitalizes on an existing educational partnership
              between HMC's Elementary School Science Center (ESSC) program and the four
              districts targeted in this grant.  

The ESSC program provides K-6 teachers
              and students with the unique opportunity to work with school districts' high
              school science faculty, volunteer HMC physicians, scientists, and professional
              staff, as well as scientists from the scientific community at large.  The
              planning grant will fund activities resulting in the identification of
              high-quality instructional materials and the design of professional development
              efforts for these districts.
