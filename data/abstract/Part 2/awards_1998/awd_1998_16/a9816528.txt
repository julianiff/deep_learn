Abstract    :
              Hebert
A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to assess whether
              turbulent mixing by breaking internal waves can produce different effective
              diffusivities for scalars with different molecular diffusivities (e.g., heat
              and salt). This
possibility was first raised by Ann Gargett in 1988 based on
              scaling arguments, but has not yet been confirmed by observations. In order to
              test this hypothesis, fluxes of slat and other tracers will be measured in a
              stratified tank containing internal waves which are breaking intermittently and
              randomly. From these measurements effective diffusivities for a set of simple
              experiments will be calculated to establish if the hypothesis of differential
              mixing can
be substantiated. Small differences in the mixing coefficient of
              heat and salt could have a large effect on the
density flux in the ocean.
