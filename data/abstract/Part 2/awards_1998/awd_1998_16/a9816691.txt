Title:  RUI: Memory of the Solar Ephemeris in Honey
              Bees


Many animals, including honey bees, memorize the time course of the
              sun's movements for use in their orientation, and there is much to learn about
              how they do this. According to the principal investigator's recent results,
              honey bees seem to memorize the sun's course only once early in life; they do
              not re-learn the sun's course relative to a new landscape if they are passively
              displaced from their natal site to another, similar site. In this project, the
              research will determine whether or not bees can ever re-learn the sun's
              movements and, if so, under what particular, biologically relevant
              circumstances.  In addition, further experiments with displaced bees will
              explore the cognitive structures underlying the bees' learning of the sun's
              course, showing, for example, whether the bees' memory of the sun's course is
              inextricably linked to their memory of the landscape, or whether the two
              memories are separable. 

Honey bees have been important model organisms in
              behavioral biology.  This species is well understood with respect to sensory
              biology and their mechanisms of communication, orientation, and learning.  The
              results of this project will therefore deepen our understanding of how complex
              external relationships are acquired and encoded by small brains in general.
