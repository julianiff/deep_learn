Abstract    :
              Most animals move irregularly-starting, stopping, and changing speeds often. 
              Despite this, most studies of locomotion use animals moving at constant speeds.
               Research on intermittent locomotion will advance the field and is the next
              logical step in the development of a general theory of activity.  This
              symposium will provide an integrated approach to the study of non-steady-state,
              intermittent locomotion to identify promising areas for future research. 
              Participants will address topics such as locomotor behavior, biomechanics,
              physiology, and biochemistry of intermittent locomotion for swimming, running
              and flying animals.  This symposium will promote communication and
              collaboration among these disciplines, with the goal of providing a more
              integrated approach to this fundamental area of integrative physiology
