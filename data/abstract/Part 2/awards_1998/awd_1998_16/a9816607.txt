     This award will provide partial support for speakers
              and others
at the Conference on Hyperplane Arrangements, held at
              Northeastern
University in Boston, Mass., June 12-15, 1999.  The focus on
              hyperplane
arrangements includes their relations to a surprising number of
              other
areas of mathematics, particularly topology, algebra, algebraic
              geometry,
combinatorics, and analysis, with applications in coding theory,
              computer
science, spline functions, and physics, among others.  The study
              of
arrangements is a relatively new branch of mathematics that has
              rapidly
attained an international following, and it is highly appropriate
              and
valuable for continued progress to have a meeting of this kind
              bring
together in one location a substantial number of those engaged. 
              The
Boston conference has attracted participants from Japan, several
              countries
of Western Europe, and Israel, as well as the more numerous
              contingent
from the U.S.  The results of the conference will be distributed in
              a
volume of abstracts prepared by the organizers, and an electronic
              version
of this volume will be made available on the web site devoted to
              the
conference [http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/amca/cadi-01].
