Abstract    :
              Marsupials are born at a state that is premature relative to other mammals.  For
              example, most organ systems in a newborn marsupial are developmentally
              equivalent to those in a 12 week human embryo, which could never survive
              outside its mother's uterus.  In marsupials, the newborn must climb to the
              teat, where it attaches, suckles, and completes its development. The PI has
              shown that relative to other animals in marsupials the brain is delayed in
              development and the bones, cartilages and muscles of the face are advanced. In
              the current project the PI will examine how early development has been changed
              to produce the unique specializations of the marsupial.  The PI will also
              compare marsupials to other animals to see how and when these specializations
              occurred in evolution.  The PI will examine the very earliest events in
              craniofacial development, with special focus on a tissue called the neural
              crest.  Neural crest is particularly important to study, as it is a tissue that
              originates from the nervous system, but provides most of the cells that make up
              the facial skeleton.  

This study will result in a better understanding of
              the important differences between marsupial and placental mammals and also to
              help resolve questions about the evolution of mammalian reproduction.  It will
              also help answer the question of how newborn marsupials can function
              independently at an embryonic state of development.  Finally it will provide
              basic information on how the brain, bones and muscles of the head are
              coordinated in development and how development may be changed in evolution.
