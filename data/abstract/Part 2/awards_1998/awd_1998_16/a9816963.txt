Sullivan
	Sullivan proposes to install a neutron source in the
              Super-K Detector.
This source will improve the detector's energy calibration,
              which is critical to the
understanding of the solar neutrino deficit puzzle. 
              Well-calibrated energy calibration is
needed to identify the sources of
              neutrino oscillation, which is the prime neutrino deficit
candidate. The
              installation will be done in the first year but analysis of the data
will be
              carried out in a 3-year program.  With the exception of the purchase of
              the
neutron source in the first year, most of the subsequent two-year budget
              goes toward
educating graduate and undergraduate students.
