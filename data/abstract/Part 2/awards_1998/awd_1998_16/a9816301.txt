              ABSTRACT
EEC-9816301
PIKAL

The Industry/University Cooperative Research
              (I/UCRC) for Pharmaceutical Processing was established at Purdue University to
              partner with pharmaceutical companies to gain understanding at the molecular
              level, of the effects of processing on critical qualities of pharmaceutical
              products and to improve process monitoring with the goal of minimizing
              validation requirements.  A planning grant (EEC-9714349) was awarded to the
              University of Connecticut to explore becoming an additional research site of
              the Center.  This five year continuing grant funds the University of
              Connecticut to become an affiliate research site of this Center.  The research
              site has received commitments of $100,000 from four new members for the
              Center.

The University of Connecticut researchers will enhance the Center's
              expertise in:

stability behavior and characterization of proteins in both
              solution 
and solid state,
the science and technology freeze
              drying,
materials science of amorphous pharmaceuticals,
tablet coating
              science and technology,
dissolution behavior, and
the study of disperse
              systems with a focus on emulsions, interfacial
characterization, and
              micro-encapsulation
