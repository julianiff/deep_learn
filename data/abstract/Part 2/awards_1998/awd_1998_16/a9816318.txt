Abstract    :
              One focus of this research will be to alter the enantioselectivities of baker's
              yeast reductions.  The resulting "designer yeasts" will be used for the
              synthesis of chiral building blocks and  for a short, asymmetric synthesis of
              N-benzoyl-2- (2R,3S)-3-phenylisoserine, the beta-amino acid found in the side
              chain of Taxol.  A second focus will employ a gene shuffling approach to
              improving the enantioselectivity of flavin monooxygenases.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Jon D. Stewart of the Department of Chemistry at the University
              of Florida.  Professor Stewart will focus his work on developing a synthetic
              strategy that combines the advantages of using purified enzymes with the
              experimental convenience of reactions using whole microbial cells.  Specific
              enzymes are produced in whole cells of baker's yeast by  DNA techniques.  The
              engineered yeast strains, known as "designer yeasts," are then used to carry
              out synthetic reactions.  New screening techniques for discovering enzymes with
              high enantioselectivity will also be developed.
