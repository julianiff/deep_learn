                           University of Maryland               This grant is awarded through
              the Separations and Purification Program        sub-element of the Interfacial,
              Transport and Separations Program of        the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Peter Kofinas at the
              University of Maryland. The        exploratory research program will
              investigate the influence of        nanostructure orientation of
              semicrystalline block copolymer blends        with the objective of developing
              nanoporous membranes with controlled        morphology and gas transport
              characteristics.  The results of these        studies could lead to a better
              fundamental understanding of the effect        of self-assembled nanodomain
              orientation on gas transport behavior in        semicrystalline copolymer
              systems.               The study of the effect of blend composition and
              orientation texture        on transport properties should assist in the
              development of design        rules for tailoring novel polymeric membranes for
              use in a wide range        of application in the barrier and gas separation
              fields.
