IBN 9816061 - "Neural Pathways for Auditory-Vocal
              Learning"

PI - Steven E. Brauth

The investigator will use a novel
              laboratory animal preparation, the budgerigar (M. undulatus) to investigate the
              neural basis of auditory-vocal learning. Auditory-vocal learning is a
              fundamentally 
important learning process in which individuals acquire
              communication sounds in a social context from other members of their species
              and is necessary for normal human speech acquisition. 
Budgerigars are used in
              these experiments because, as in humans, specialized brain pathways have
              evolved which interconnect auditory and vocal areas of the forebrain. In order
              to understand how these neural systems acquire and utilize learned
              communication sounds in a social context, the investigator will use a strategy
              which combines neuroanatomical techniques, which map out brain circuits, with
              powerful new methods which map expression of immediate early gene 
proteins.
              There is now overwhelming evidence that long term changes in neuronal function,
              such as those underlying learning and memory, depend on the expression of
              immediate early gene proteins. In this application, the investigator will first
              identify neurons which both process auditory feedback for vocal learning and
              also express the zenk immediate early gene protein (also called zif268, egr1,
              NGFIA, Krox 24). Zenk is believed to be closely related to the plasticity
              processes associated with vocal learning. The investigator will then assess the
              effects of dysfunction of these neurons on both vocal learning as well as on
              long term zenk expression by neurons in other portions of the auditory and
              vocal control systems.
