Atmospheric meridional heat transport plays a central role in
              the climate systems of both Earth and Mars, helping to regulate the north-south
              temperature difference.  Dr. Barnes will use numerical experiments with a
              simplified atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) to investigate eddy heat
              transports and their role in determining the zonal-mean meridional temperature
              gradient.  The results should shed considerable light on the differences
              between the terrestrial and Martian transient eddy regimes, and contribute to a
              better fundamental understanding of how eddy heat transport acts to regulate
              the meridional thermal gradient in the two atmospheres.  Understanding this is
              important to assessing the effects of climatic variations on longer time scales
              for both planets. Funding for this project is shared between the Division of
              Astronomical Sciences  and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
