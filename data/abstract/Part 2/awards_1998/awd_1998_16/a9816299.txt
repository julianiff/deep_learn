Abstract    :
              Ewing is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program  to carry out
              experimental studies that aim to advance fundamental knowledge of molecular
              adlayer processes at ionic surfaces.  In one class, the high resolution
              rovibrational spectroscopy of  two dimensional quantum crystals of hydrogen and
              methane and their isotopic variants will be studied via infrared spectroscopy
              to elucidate the fundamental nature of these systems.   This study includes
              examining the role of dimensionality on the properties of molecular quantum
              crystals.  In the second class, properties of submonolayer, monolayer, and thin
              film water and ice on ionic substrates near ambient conditions will be
              explored. Thermodynamic properties such as phase diagrams will be determined,
              as well as gas solubility and chemical reactions within the thin films. 
              Outcomes from these experiments will impact the understanding of environmental
              phenomena, as well as increase the basic understanding of water interactions
              with ionic surfaces.  

Ionic crystals, or salts, are ubiquitous in nature. 
              This  project will lead to insights into how molecules interact with ionic
              surfaces, outcomes with both fundamental and applied implications.  For
              example, thin films of water exist on all ionic surfaces under ambient
              conditions, and play important roles in cloud formation, soil properties, 
              caking of crystallite powders, and chemical reactions on salts.
