Abstract    :
              Visual behavior depends on how the eye can identify relevant targets in the
              environment.  In short, how we see depends on the eye and the brain.  One
              relatively simple system that has been used as a very successful model for
              visual study is the compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus.  It is now
              known that this marine animal can set its eye to extremely high sensitivity
              under low light conditions, as it searches underwater for mates while walking
              in shallow water on moonlit nights.  This project combines anatomical and
              physiological approaches with behavioral work to better understand how the
              animal sees.  Studies in the field utilize a unique small camera mounted on the
              shell of the crab to capture the same visual stimuli seen by one eye, and
              simultaneous recording of the activity in the optic nerve from that eye.  The
              crab is presented with a variety of stimulus shapes and contrasts to test what
              features are used to visually identify and approach a potential mate.  The
              combination of measurements from the camera and the optic nerve fibers allow
              analysis of how the activity of nerve cells encodes visual information for
              processing by the brain.
   Results will reveal concepts of how neural signals
              are used to generate visual behavior, and will be relevant to the fields of
              neuroethology, behavior, marine science, and reproductive biology, in addition
              to visual neuroscience.  This project also provides support for students to
              gain an unusually multidisciplinary research experience.
