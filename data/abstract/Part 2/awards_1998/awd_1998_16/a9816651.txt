Title: Coevolution of Genes and Animal Cultures



This
              project will examine the idea that a culturally transmitted trait, bird song,
              influences the genetic structure of animal populations.  Song birds learn their
              songs in the first few months of life by imitating the songs of adult birds. 
              Song learning often leads to the formation of regional dialects, much as in
              human speech, which is also learned early in life.  It has been suggested that
              if both males and females learn their songs and then chose mates based on song,
              then gene flow between dialects will be restricted.  Nelson and Parker will
              study the song dialects of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow along
The
              northwest coast of North America.  A series of song playback experiments will
              be used to define dialect boundaries that are perceptually meaningful to the
              birds.  The researchers will then compare genetic variation between dialects
              using genetic markers produced from tiny blood samples taken from birds.  The
              genotypic data will also be used to follow dispersal of birds relative to
              dialect boundaries.  

Since song dialects are one of the few examples of
              long-lasting culturally-transmitted traditions known in animals, they provide a
              useful model system for study of the vocal learning process, and how learned
              vocalizations (culture) may affect the genetic structure of animal populations.
               This project will provide basic information on these issues, which may
              ultimately prove useful in understanding similar processes in humans.
