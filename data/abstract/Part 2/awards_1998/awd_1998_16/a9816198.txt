This Americas Program award will help to support the
              participation of three prominent U.S. experts in a September 1998 conference in
              Trinidad and Tobago entitled "Furthering Cooperation in Science and Technology
              for Caribbean Development."  The American Association for the Advancement of
              Science (AAAS) is assisting the Caribbean Academy of Sciences in organizing the
              conference, which will also serve as the regional preparatory meeting for the
              June 1999 UNESCO World Science Conference.
The purpose of this conference is
              to help countries of the region share their experience in building and applying
              an indigenous capacity for research through education and training; identify
              areas of common interest where joint research and application of new
              technologies is possible; examine the linkage between producers of research and
              users of the research product; and assess how modern information and
              communication technologies can help achieve results in these areas.
