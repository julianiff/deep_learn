Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert J. Angelici, Department of Chemistry, Iowa State University is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division (i) to determine the basicities of various metal
              complexes by measuring enthalpies of protonation using calorimetric techniques
              and a very strong acid (trifluoromethylsulfonic acid) in organic media, (ii) to
              understand the influence of the nature of the metal and the ligands on these
              basicities, and (iii) to examine the effects protonation has on promoting
              reactions of these metal complexes that might be useful in the design of new
              homogeneous catalysts.

The work proposed seeks to assess the basicities of
              several metal complexes at the metal centers which will prove useful to the
              design of new homogeneous catalysts and will provide invaluable thermodynamic
              data to other chemists. Several students and post-doctoral associates will be
              trained in the synthesis of many of the metal complexes and in the
              understanding of the thermodynamics and reactivities of compounds.
