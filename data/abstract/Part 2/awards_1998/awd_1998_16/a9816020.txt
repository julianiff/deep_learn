	This award provides partial funding support for the
              operation of the High-Resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography Laboratory in the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas, Austin. X-ray
              computed tomography is a non-destructive technique for imaging the interior of
              opaque solids. To produce images, X-rays are directed through a slice of
              specimen along thousands of different paths. Measurements of the attenuation of
              the X-ray signal along each path are combined mathematically to generate a map
              of values for the linear attenuation coefficient at hundreds of thousands of
              points within the slice. Since attenuation is mainly dependent upon specimen
              density, the result is a map of density contrasts within the slice. A
              three-dimensional image is constructed by stacking contiguous slice images.
              Originally developed for medical diagnosis, the technology has been adapted for
              earth science applications by substantially increasing the energy and intensity
              of the X-ray source and increasing the spatial resolution of the images by
              nearly two orders of magnitude. Applications in the earth sciences include
              imaging the porosity of drill cores to understand the flow of groundwater and
              oil, imaging internal structures of fossil specimens, non-destructive studies
              of the textures of metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks. This award will
              make it possible to operate the X-ray Computed Tomography Lab as a multi-user
              facility open to qualified researchers at nominal cost.
