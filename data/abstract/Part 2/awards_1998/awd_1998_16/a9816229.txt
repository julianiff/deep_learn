Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Kit Bowen of Johns Hopkins University will use negative
              ion photoelectron spectroscopy to study four categories of gas-phase cluster
              anions and related species.  The projects include an investigation of the
              stabilization of unstable anions or of excess electrons by solvation,
              exploration of double Rydberg anions (closed-shell cations with two
              Rydberg-like electrons), and an examination of orbital angular momentum
              designations for alkali metal cluster anions.  

Negative ions and excess
              electron states play important roles in chemistry and related fields.  Solvated
              anions are fundamental species in radiation chemistry and govern a host of
              phenomena in solution.  This work will help provide a link between the world of
              temporary ions and that of "wet" chemistry.  Broader impacts are possible in
              the areas of biological genetic damage research, physics, and materials
              science.
