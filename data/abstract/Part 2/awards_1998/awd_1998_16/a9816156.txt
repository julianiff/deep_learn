	This award provides partial funding (67%) for the
              acquisition of a data mass storage system for the Southern California
              Earthquake Center's Data Center at the California Institute of Technology. The
              remaining funding necessary for this acquisition is to be provided by the
              Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). The SCEC Data Center is the
              primary archive facility for seismic data recorded by a large seismograph
              network in southern California. The mass storage system will allow SCEC to
              archive the large volume of data and make it easily available to the research
              community in seismology. The SCEC Data Center will develop software for using
              the system in cooperation with other seismic data centers in the U.S. so as to
              create a seamless interface for the user community.
