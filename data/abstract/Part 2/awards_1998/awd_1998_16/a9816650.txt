This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) for global change research at
              the University of South Florida (USF).  Co-PIs, Quinn and  Flower will use the
              mass spectrometer to generate high-resolution stable oxygen and carbon isotopic
              records, primarily from coralline and foraminiferal carbonate, as proxies of
              paleo sea-surface temperatures, paleoproductivity and past atmospheric pCO2
              conditions in studies of global climate change.  The new light stable isotope
              facility at USF will have numerous benefits to USF faculty, students and other
              researchers in the greater Tampa Bay area.  Some of  these benefits include: 
              1) helping to further establish a productive program in paleoclimatology,
              sedimentary geochemistry and paleoceanography,  2) permitting the exploration
              of new research in stable isotope geochemistry by USF faculty and students, 3)
              allowing the expansion of interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues
              outside of the Earth and Marine Sciences, and 4) facilitating the integratioin
              of undergraduate and graduate students into analytically based research
              projects.  The SIRMS will be housed in a newly renovated space specifically
              designed for such a facility and its associated sample preparation rooms. 
              Support for this grant is shared equally between the Earth Science
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF), the Division of Ocean
              Sciences' Oceanographic Instrumentation and Technical Services Program
              (OCE/ITS) and the Paleoclimate Program of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences
              (ATM/PC).
