Abstract    :
              This proposal will investigate meter scale plasma density irregularities
              associated with turbulence in the lower ionosphere.   The majority of the work
              will involve VHF coherent radar experiments, including operational and data
              analysis of a novel radar under development.  The project will improve the
              understanding of ionospheric turbulence, by developing a fluid theory,
              potentially into a nonlinear regime.
