Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of
              Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Gilbert Walker of the University of
              Pittsburgh will study the structure and dynamics involved in the binding of
              nitric oxide with cysteinyl binding sites in serum albumin (SA) and
              glutathione.  The proposed work will employ state-of-the-art transient and
              static, infrared and visible, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopies.
               The conformational information resulting from these studies will aid in
              understanding the mechanisms of thermolytic nitric oxide release processes at
              cysteines.  These experiments will be compared to ab initio theoretical
              predictions of the optimized cysteine-NO geometry and potential energy
              surface.

The proposed project will help understand how the molecular
              structure of proteins affects their ability to bind with substances, called
              ligands, and how these ligands affect long-range signaling in the proteins. 
              Proteins such as those studied here, which contain the cysteine residue, are
              principal scavengers of nitric oxides in living systems.  Nitric oxides are
              among the gases that are important in atmospheric ozone destruction and global
              warming.  Escape of these gases from microbes during waste water treatment, for
              example, is also a concern in industrial processing.
