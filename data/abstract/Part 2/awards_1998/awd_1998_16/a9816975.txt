Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms
              for success and failure of excipients as protein stablilizers in solution,
              during freezing, drying, and reconstitution.  Questions to be addressed during
              the course of the project include: (1) what are the implications of protein
              surface modification on protein stabilizer interactions and the capacity of
              such excipients to protect proteins during processing; (2) when and how do
              surfactants stabilize proteins in solution, and during freezing, drying, and
              reconstitution; (3) can the solution thermodynamic model developed by Timasheff
              and co-workers be used to explain the inhibition of protein chemical
              degradation kinetics by preferentially excluded solutes; and (4) what processes
              can account for apparent time-dependent degradation processes in samples stored
              in dried solids at temperatures below formulation glass transition
              temperatures.
