Title: Historical effects on the evolution of female
              preferences

Animal communication involves a signaler and receiver.  The
              mechanisms and evolution of communication systems will be investigated by
              examination of how receivers (female tungara frogs) respond to different levels
              of variation in signals (male calls).  Natural signal variation, the
              differences between male calls, occurs within local populations, among
              populations, and among species. Females will be presented calls from different
              populations of frogs to determine if they prefer local calls to foreign calls,
              even though all calls are of the same species.  These results will reveal
              whether or not signal variation among populations in calls contains meaningful
              information.  The investigators will also present females with calls from other
              species and synthetic calls that differ from the species-specific call in
              specified ways.  Responses to this level of variation will be used to examine
              the evolutionary trajectory of receiver preferences.  

Human-engineered
              communication systems, such as a radio receiver and transmitter,  have a
              perfect match between a signal and receiver.  But animal communication systems
              evolve and their past evolutionary history can determine the degree to which a
              signal and a receiver are matched.  By understanding how receivers respond to
              signal variation within species, among species, as well as to evolutionary
              relevant synthetic signals, the effects of past evolutionary history on current
              function of animal communication systems can be understood.
