Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to examine the specific nature of the
              microbial population within deep sea subsurface environments.  This project has
              four components: 1) to characterize the biodiversity that exists in subseafloor
              environments and determine the nature of constituent microbial physiologies; 2)
              to determine the chemical bioenergetics of the subsurface, specifically the
              carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous species of microbial relevance that
              are prevalent in subsurface environments; 3) to determine the intracellular
              bioenergetics of model hetertrophic hyperthermophiles and those newly-isolated
              from the subsurface, including their primary energy currency and electron
              carriers, and their organic and inorganic `signatures`; and 4) to characterize
              the extracellular bioenergetics of known and newly-isolated hyperthermophiles
              in subsurface environments, including electron donors and acceptors, inorganic
              nutrients, and their capacity to produce exocellular polymers, to inhabit
              biofilms, and to exist as consortia.  The results of this project are to serve
              as a paradigm for the characterization of extraterrestrial ecosystems and
              potential life forms therein.
