Abstract    :
              Blumenthal
Enzymatic transmethylation of molecules from the highly abundant
              methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) presents a paradox. On the one
              hand, AdoMet-dependent methylation is central to everything from metal
              detoxification through biosynthesis to gene regulation via DNA methylation.
              Analysis of genome sequences from archaea, eubacteria, fungi, plants and
              animals suggests that a surprisingly large fraction of all genes specify
              AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases.  On the other hand, remarkably little is
              known about this important and diverse group of enzymes. For example, it was
              only four years ago that the first structure of an AdoMet-dependent enzyme was
              reported. Since that time, it has been found that almost all characterized
              AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases share a common core structure despite
              having virtually undetectable sequence identity and despite methylating
              substrates as different as catechol and DNA. In terms of biological importance
              and the potential for providing basic insights into structure-function
              relationships and enzyme evolution, the AdoMet-dependent enzymes appear to be
              ripe for intensified investigation.

From July 17 through July 22, 1999, the
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) is sponsoring
              the fourth biennial summer research conference on Biological Methylation. These
              meetings are virtually unique in their focus on the full range of
              AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, a diverse set of enzymes of broad
              biological function and importance. The conferences are held at the Vermont
              Academy in Saxtons River, VT, and attract an international group of
              participants.
