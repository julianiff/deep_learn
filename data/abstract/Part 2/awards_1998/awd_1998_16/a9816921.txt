Abstract    :
              One of the sensory systems important for postural control is the vestibular
              system, part of the inner ear in the head.  The semicircular canal organs are
              the fluid-filled tubes and associated sensory structures in this system that
              detect rotational motion.  There are three canals on each side of the head, and
              on each side they are oriented in almost perpendicular planes; this general
              structure is conserved in all bony vertebrates.  It is curious that the canal
              arcs are apparently never exactly in flat planes, and that they also always are
              slightly skewed from being mutually perpendicular.  It is not yet clear how the
              detailed fluid dynamics within these curved tiny tubes are encoded into neural
              responses that signal particular directions of head rotation.  This
              collaborative project uses a combination of electrophysiological recording of
              neural activity and computerized modeling of the detailed dimensions and
              physical properties of the fluid flow in the canal of the ears in a
              well-studied model system with very accessible canals, the toadfish.  In a
              novel approach, the canals are not modeled in isolation, but each canal is
              modeled in the context of the fluid movement in the adjoining canals.  The
              results will provide fundamental advances in our understanding of these sensory
              parts of a sophisticated control system for posture and locomotor control.
  
              The potential impact will extend beyond simply basic otolaryngology, because it
              will lead to understanding evolutionary as well as biological considerations of
              mechanisms for postural function and sensorimotor control.
