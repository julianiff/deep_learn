	This project supports the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from the University of Colorado, studying
              how the use of biomedical technology is affected by local historical and
              ideological contingencies.  The project will analyze the use of prenatal
              diagnostic tests, specifically amniocentesis and obstetrical ultrasound in
              Germany.  While government policy recommends a minimum of three ultrasounds per
              pregnancy, German society has a history of eugenic misuse of biomedical testing
              and a vociferous current public discourse against neo-eugenics. .  The outcome
              is that the German public uses these prenatal tests at a much higher rate than
              other comparable populations, although with tremendous international variation.
              The project will compare ethnic Germans and immigrant Turkish residents in
              their use of the technology, testing hypotheses about the relative roles of
              public discourse, government policy, and the importance of ethnic, religious,
              income and education variables in the use of ultrasound.   The student will
              conduct ethnographic research at clinical, research institute, and community
              settings in three mid-sized cities in Germany.  The project will advance our
              knowledge of the social and ethical dimensions of biomedical technology use. In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and
              advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
