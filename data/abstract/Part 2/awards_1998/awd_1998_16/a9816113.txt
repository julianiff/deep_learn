This is a 36 month award proposed by Dr. Michael Plummer,
              Vanderbilt  University, collaborating with Dr. Nawarat Ananchuen, Silpakorn
              University in Thailand.  
Dr. Plummer requests funds for travel and 30 days
              per diem per year for two years to carry out a cooperative project on matching
              extension in graphs and networks.  
Dr. Plummer is a world leader in graph
              theory and highly respected in this field.  This proposal is well written, with
              nice general outlines of the problems.  This study is likely to result in
              significant contributions to this field.  This cooperative project is between a
              world class expert and a junior colleague in Thailand, and, if successful,
              could stimulate further research in graph theory in East Asia.
