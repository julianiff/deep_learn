Abstract    :
              9816492  Kelly  The overall objective of this project is to examine the specific
              nature of the microbial population within deep sea subsurface environments. 
              this project has four components; 1) to characterize the biodiversity that
              exists in subseafloor environments and determine the nature of constituent
              microbial physiologies; 2) to determine the chemical bioenergetics of the
              subsurface, specifically the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous species
              of microbial relevance that are prevalent in subsurface environments; 3) to
              determine the intracellular bioenergetics of model hetertrophic
              hyperthermophiles and those newly-isolated from the subsurface, including their
              primary energy currency and electron carriers, and their organic and inorganic
              "signatures"; and 4) to characterize the extracellular bioenergetics of known
              and newly-isolated hyperthermophiles in subsurface environments, including
              electron donors and acceptors, inorganic nutrients, and their capacity to
              produce exocellular polymers, to inhabit biofilms, and to exist as consortia. 
              The results of this project are to serve as a paradigm for the characterization
              of extraterrestrial ecosystems and potential life forms therein.  ***
