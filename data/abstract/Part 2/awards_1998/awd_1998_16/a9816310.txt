This planning grant would begin the research needed to gather
              the experts and knowledge needed to conduct a working conference and develop
              material that could be used to support the reform of science teaching at the
              elementary school level.  Given current priorities for literacy instruction, it
              is important that members of the science education community learn more about
              the ways in which the practices inherent in the systemic reform of science
              education at the elementary school level can improve students' reading,
              writing, and speaking abilities.  The grant will identify studies and reports
              of practice that will be useful in shaping an argument to the literacy and
              policy community in favor of hands-on, inquiry-based science instruction.  Once
              these studies are identified, a plan for dissemination through conferences and
              written material will be developed.
