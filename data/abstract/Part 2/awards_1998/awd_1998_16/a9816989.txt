Title:  Factors affecting conditional expression of male
              preferences

 This research project focuses on understanding flexibility in
              female behavioral responses to males. The study will use house sparrows, Passer
              domesticus, as the subjects in several aviary and field experiments. Aviary
              experiments will test predictions about the impact of male aggressive
              tendencies, social familiarity and status, as well as morphological and
              behavioral traits on a female's choice of a partner.  Field data will uncover
              the impact of these factors on social status, general breeding success, and
              parental behavior. A cross-fostering study will help establish the level of
              genetic influence on behavioral and morphological traits involved in
              male-female interactions.

This project is significant at several levels.
              First, it will help lead to better theory for the evolution of breeding
              preference strategies. Second, it will uncover some of the implications of
              flexibility in females for behavioral evolution. Finally, this project will
              investigate the influence of social interactions between males and females on
              the development of female behavior. A general understanding of the development
              of gender specific behavior and the effects of social behavior between males
              and females on development has important implications understanding a variety
              of biological questions about gender specific evolutionary processes.
