Abstract    :
              The research proposed is directed at the discovery of superior catalysts for the
              electrochemical reduction of dioxygen and other technologically important
              molecules.  The proposal will also involve work on the development of new
              catalysts for reactions that require the transfer of multiple electrons. 
              Finally, a new method for determination of the rates of electron transfer
              across liquid/liquid interfaces will be used for the study of electron
              transfers in the absence of accompanying ion transfers.  Substituted porphyrins
              will be used as mediators for the reduction of dioxygen.  Heteropolyanions will
              be used as reservoirs of electrons for multiple electron transfer reactions. 
              Applications to improved fuel cells and air batteries are envisioned.
