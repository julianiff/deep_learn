Abstract    :
              This research program will utilize the West Virginia University Q Machine to
              perform an experimental study of plasma turbulence that is driven by velocity
              shear structures.  The ion-cyclotron and ion-acoustic plasma instabilities are
              known to be important in the generation and propagation of waves in the
              magnetosphere and the ionosphere.  It has been found that inhomogeneities in
              perpendicular flows have been shown to significantly decrease the threshold at
              which these plasma instabilities may be excited.  Laboratory experiments will
              be performed to elucidate the roles of the different mechanisms that have been
              identified, might lead to enhanced growth rates of these instabilities.  The
              expermental results will have direct application to wave phenomena observed in
              the magnetosphere and ionosphere.
