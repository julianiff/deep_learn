Abstract    :
              9816237  Paxton    A research team led by Dr. Larry Paxton will investigate the
              processes which populate the exospheres of Mars, Venus, and Earth and which can
              lead to significant escape of atomic oxygen from the Mars atmosphere.  The
              group will produce model distributions of the exospheric atomic oxygen and
              validate the model by comparing it to existing observational data sets.  The
              result will be a comparison of the mechanisms at work in each of the three
              planets' exospheres and a first order look at how they have varied over time. 
              The main area of concentration will be the processes at work in the Martian
              atmosphere and the implications for atmospheric evolution.  Funding for this
              project is shared among the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of
              Atmospheric Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
