Abstract    :
                 For many animals, vibrations transmitted by air or water  provide information
              about the local three-dimensional environment.  Often there are extremely
              complex mechanosensory systems  integrating extremely complex stimulus fields. 
              This collaborative  research project exploits a small aquatic crustacean, a
              copepod,  as a novel model system that can be considered much simpler than  the
              insects and large crustaceans used in other analyses.  The  copepod brain has
              fewer than 1000 neurons and lives in a simple  flow environment where the
              animal creates a feeding current across  the antennae.  This current has some
              local turbulence in the open,  but is converted to a smooth laminar flow field
              across the  antenna.   Microscale hydrodynamics, receptor neurophysiology and 
              behavioral studies are used to clarify the mechanisms that  transduce the 3-D
              information of natural signals into a neural  signal, and underlie behavior
              such as feeding or escape from  swimming predators detected by this small but
              sophisticated  mechanosensory system.      Results will be important for
              understanding 3-D processing in  mechanosensory systems, and there is potential
              impact beyond  neuroscience to biological oceanography because of the
              importance  of copepods in the food web, and potential impact on the design of 
              biosensors and robotic sensory technology.
