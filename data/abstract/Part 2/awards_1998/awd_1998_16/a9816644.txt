Abstract    :
              Recent developments in three-dimensional digitizing hardware and software make
              it possible, practical, and economical to scan and archive complex-shaped
              objects, including a range of skeletal elements from a variety of large and
              small-sized species, into a digital library for study and research.  Making
              anatomical materials, including elements from species commonly used in
              education and rare or even endangered species, widely available has
              far-reaching implications for research and for education from grade school
              through graduate school. This project will begin the creation of such a
              library, starting with chimpanzees and baboons and using both low and high
              resolution technologies.  It will also design and implement a discovery
              interface that will provide an interactive framework for investigation that
              will benefit both beginning and advanced users.  The project builds on work at
              the University of Texas, Austin including  the course  Introduction to Physical
              Anthropology and Human Evolution and the CD-ROM Virtual Laboratories for
              Physical Anthropology.
