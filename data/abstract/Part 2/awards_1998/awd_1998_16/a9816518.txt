This project involves the dissertation
              research of a cultural anthropology student from Washington University in St.
              Louis.  The study examines the spread of Protestantism in the third world
              through an ethnographic comparison of three Philippine Baptist congregations in
              the city of Baguio.  By comparing a middle-class group with a relatively
              lower-class minority congregation and a Philippine-born Chinese congregation,
              the student will look at the relative importance of church doctrine, local
              history, and social context in shaping religious behavior.   The methods
              include participant observation and formal as well as informal interviews with
              respondents ranging from the entire small congregation to 50-60 person samples
              of larger groups.  This project will advance our understanding of how local
              religious communities draw upon translocal traditions and networks to establish
              local variants of global Protestant religious communities. The project will
              also contribute to the training of a young social scientist and advance our
              knowledge about this important region of the world.
