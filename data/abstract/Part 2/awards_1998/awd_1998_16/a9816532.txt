Title: Travel Support for Scientists from the United States to Attend
              the Seventh WMO Scientific Conference on Weather Modification (in Chiang Mai,
              Thailand; March 17-22,1999)

This grant will provide partial travel support
              for approximately ten U.S. scientists to attend the WMO conference on weather
              modification, to be held in Thailand on 17-22 March 1999.  Scientists receiving
              the awards will be chosen by a selection committee consisting of
              representatives from the AMS committees on Cloud Physics and Weather
              Modification, plus Dr, Harold Orville, who chairs the conference program
              committee.  Preference will be given to candidates who will make important
              scientific contributions to the conference, to those who would be unable to
              attend otherwise, and to promising younger scientists.
