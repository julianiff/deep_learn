Title: "A symposium -- Variation in lizard social behavior:
              Individuals, populations and species"

	This symposium will present the
              results of recent research on the variation in social behavior in lizards and
              bring together both participants and an audience eager to exchange ideas about
              this topic.  It will be held in conjunction with the 1999 annual meeting of the
              Herpetologists' League at the Penn State campus in State College, Pennsylvania,
              and USA.  Although several symposia presenting aspects of lizard ecology and
              stressing their importance as model organisms for the study of ecology have
              been held (in 1965, 1980, and 1993), and all included papers that discussed
              aspects of social behavior, none presented a thorough review of the current
              understanding of social behavior in lizards.  This symposium will focus on
              social behavior and the proceedings will be published as a volume of
              contributed chapters.  The symposium and volume should prove important not just
              to the field of herpetology, but also to the field of animal behavior in
              general.
