Abstract    :
              Professors John Angus and Alfred Anderson of Case Western Reserve University
              will complete fundamental studies of the interactions between donor and
              acceptor dopants in chemical-vapor-deposited diamond films in work supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  The  goal of this project is an
              understanding of charge transport properties through interfaces of such
              surfaces with electrolytes.  In this project, the emphasis is on a
              semiconducting diamond layer with boron as the primary dopant.  Properties of
              the surface are studied through theoretical modeling, and through experimental
              techniques such as electrochemical measurements, scanning electron microscopy,
              atomic force microscopy, and surface tunneling microscopy, each of which have
              been successfully used in past work in this laboratory. 

Diamond films on
              electrode surfaces have attractive properties of wide potential range and low
              intrinsic electrical noise when used in devices used as chemical sensors, and
              used in electrosynthetic applications.  This project provides the understanding
              of how electrical charge moves through these thin films, especially those with
              trace levels of dopant atoms. .
