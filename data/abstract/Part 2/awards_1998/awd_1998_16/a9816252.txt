This grant provides support for the acquisition of a stable
              isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with automated sample
              preparation devices for the Department of Geological Sciences at Rutgers
              University.  Dr. James Wright has recently joined the faculty at Rutgers after
              four years on the faculty at the University of Maine where he left behind a
              SIRMS lab.  This grant will establish a new SIRMS facility at Rutgers for
              stable isotopic research in Cenozoic paleoceanography, climate change and
              continental margin sedimentation. In  addition to Wright,  Dr. Kenneth Miller
              and faculty from the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences should help to
              ensure full subscription of this instrument.
