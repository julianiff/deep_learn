Method of Digital Image Correlation in combination with
              probe microscopy is developed for application to smaller dimensions,
              establishing limits on the size scale. This utilized to measure mechanical
              properties, including fracture-failure at submicron scale with MEMS
              applications. The fracture and fatigue behavior of homogeneoous solids and at
              interfaces in MEMS size structures contribute to the understanding of failure
              behavior at microscopic domains.***
