Abstract    :
              This conference, which is expected to have 200-250 participants, will focus on
              the molecular mechanisms of sensing and response in several bacterial systems. 
              The meeting format is designed to foster extensive discussions of recent
              developments and ideas among researchers from the United States and abroad. 
              The program will include approximately 60 oral presentations and 100 posters,
              allowing virtually all laboratories working in this rapidly moving field to
              present their key findings.  A significant portion of conference funds will be
              used to cover the travel and registration expenses of graduate student
              participants.  Scientific sessions will compare the sensory and locomotor
              systems of a variety of prokaryotes.  Presentations will focus on each
              fundamental step in the signal transduction pathways:  (a) transmembrane
              signaling by chemo- and photo-receptors and their adaptation by covalent
              modifications, (b) signal transmission by intracellular phosphorelay cascades,
              (c) sensory control of cellular motility, gene expression and development, and
              (d) the mechanics of cell motility.  Bacterial sensory systems have important
              roles in microbial ecology and pathogenesis, and provide useful models for
              understanding analogous signaling systems in eukaryotes.  This series of
              conferences, of which this is the fifth biennial meeting, has become the
              principal forum for investigators in the field to present current findings and
              to discuss emerging concepts of bacterial sensing and motility.  A summary of
              the conference will be published to provide a readily accessible overview of
              the present state of the field to others.
