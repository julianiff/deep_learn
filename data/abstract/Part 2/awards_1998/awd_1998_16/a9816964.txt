Title: Workshop on Electromagnetic Crystal
              Structure, Design, Syntheses, and Application

Abstract

This meeting will
              provide a forum for the university researchers and industry developers to
              discuss and explore the emerging concepts of photonic band structures and to
              exchange the latest technical information and applications. The early work on
              photonic band structure mainly focussed on the creation of artificial crystals
              made of dielectric materials for optical wavelengths. This workshop will extend
              the concept to radio and microwave regions, and to include metal in
              dielectrics. Potential applications may include small antennas and nanocavities
              for very short  wavelengths.
