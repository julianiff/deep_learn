Abstract    :
              The focus of this work will be on two aspects of the architecture of the ocean
              crustal volcanic section:  the role of volcanic growth faults on slow-spreading
              ridges, and the relative abundance of different types of lava flow morphologies
              as a function of spreading rate.  The data sets to be analyzed include archived
              ALVIN bathymetry, video imagery, and outboard 35 mm camera still pictures
              collected during traverses across scarps on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the
              Galapagos spreading center, the East Pacific Rise, the Cayman trough, and the
              Juan de Fuca/Gorda Ridge.
