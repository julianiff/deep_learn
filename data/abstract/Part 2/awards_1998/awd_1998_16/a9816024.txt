Abstract    :
              The 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation-ICRA99 is a
              biennial conference being held May 10 to 15, 1999 in Detroit, Michigan.  It is
              the premiere international symposium of its kind, attracting researchers and
              practicing engineers from around the world.  To encourage student participation
              at the conference, a "Best Student Paper" competition has been implemented. 
              This proposal request travel support for students from U.S. universities who
              are selected to participate in the Student Paper competition but who without a
              travel subsidy would be unable to participate.   http://www.cs.umn.edu/icra99/
