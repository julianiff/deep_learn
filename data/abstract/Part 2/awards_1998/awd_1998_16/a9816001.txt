The Role of Keystone Herbivores in Regulating
              Ecosystem Function: An Experimental Approach Using Long-Term Herbivore
              Removals

This study examines how two major insect herbivores impact pinyon
              pine-juniper woodlands.  The pinyon needle scale insect defoliates juvenile
              pines while the stem-boring moth kills shoots of mature trees.  The impact of
              these herbivores is regionally extensive and appears to be positively
              correlated with environmental stress.  Taking advantage of two long-term moth
              and scale removal experiments (15 and 13 years, respectively) we propose to
              examine the ecosystem effects of herbivory in experimental plots with three
              classes of trees, 1) susceptible trees infested with moth or scale insects, 2)
              susceptible trees from which these herbivores have been removed annually for at
              lease 13 years and 3) trees that are naturally resistant to moth or scales.  By
              comparing tree/soil systems with and without chronic herbivory, we can better
              understand how herbivores affect productivity and nutrient cycling in
              pinyon-juniper woodlands, a major vegetation type of the southwestern United
              States.
