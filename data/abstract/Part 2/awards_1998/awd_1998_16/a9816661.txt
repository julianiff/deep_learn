Abstract    :

Proteins are highly cooperative structures in which interactions or
              perturbations occurring at specific locations are often propagated to distal
              places within the molecule. The mechanisms by which these processes occur are
              still not understood. The problem is compounded by the experimental
              realization, mainly from NMR-detected hydrogen exchange experiments, that even
              under native conditions proteins must be considered as statistical ensembles.
              The long range goal of this project is to investigate the structural
              distribution of cooperative interactions in proteins, how this distribution is
              modulated by ligand binding or interactions with other molecules, and how
              signals or perturbations localized in specific regions of the protein molecule
              are transduced to other regions. The experimental work will be performed with
              the wild type and site-specific mutants of the SH3 domain, a protein motif
              involved in the regulation of signal-transduction pathways whose
              crystallographic and NMR structures are known at high resolution. The approach
              to be used involves a combination of experimental thermodynamic and NMR
              studies, statistical thermodynamic analysis and structure-based thermodynamic
              computations.

The success of this project is not only of scientific
              interest. It has important practical implications and is expected to benefit
              protein design strategies aimed at developing mutant proteins with improved
              functionality, cooperativity and stability under specific chemical or physical
              environments.
