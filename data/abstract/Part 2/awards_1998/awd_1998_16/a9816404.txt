The objective of this renewal grant is to exploit the
              microscopic techniques developed in a previously funded effort for high
              resolution, topographic imaging with concurrent optical, electrochemical,
              photoelectrochemical, and fluorescence mapping.  The techniques are based on
              novel modifications of the Near Field Optical Scanning Microscope (NSOM,
              Topometrix) to obtain shear force feedback control with a piezoelectric tuning
              fork.  In the past work resolutions were achieved for the above functional
              microscopies at or just below 100 nm.  This effort extends the resolution to 10
              nm or below.  The precursor sites leading to pitting corrosion are explored on
              high purity titanium and on aluminum alloys.  This should facilitate in situ
              and ex situ evaluation of surface treatments to mitigate pitting corrosion.  A
              second objective uses the high-resolution capabilities of the instrumentation
              to identify corrosion of microstructured microelectronic and magnetic storage
              assemblies.

As the dimension of these materials decrease, corrosion
              becomes increasingly important, and techniques to explore heterogeneous
              surfaces are needed.  Scanning electrochemical microscopy with concurrent
              topographic mapping is an excellent technique being developed for these
              studies.
