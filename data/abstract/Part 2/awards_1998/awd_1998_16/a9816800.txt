Title:  The Shiny Cowbird and the Village Weaver - A Model
              System for
Studying Change in Host Response to Brood Parasitism

Brood
              parasitism in birds occurs when the females of one species lay their
eggs in
              the nests of a host species.  The host species then rears the
offspring of the
              parasite.  Host species may evolve defenses against brood
parasitism.  One
              such defense is egg rejection in which eggs of the
parasitic species are
              removed from the nest.  A host species, the Village
Weaver, was introduced to
              the island of Hispaniola without its brood
parasite.  Studies conducted in
              1982-1985 by Dr. Cruz showed that in the
absence of its brood parasite the
              village weaver ceased to exhibit egg
rejection behavior.  Recently, the shiny
              cow bird, a brood parasite of the
village weaver, has been introduced to the
              island of Hispaniola thereby
producing a unique natural experiment for study
              of how host defense
behavior against brood parasitism may evolve.  Dr. Cruz
              will determine the
length of time that populations of the village weaver have
              been exposed to
the brood parasite; and will determine how defense behaviors
              such as egg
rejection and aggression toward the brood parasite are correlated
              with the
time of exposure.

This research has great potential for the
              understanding of avian brood
parasitism.  It has broad evolutionary
              implications as it will provide an
estimate of the time needed for a host
              species to evolve defensive
behavior.  In addition, because brood parasitism
              by cow birds may pose a
threat to migratory song birds in North America, it is
              important that the
dynamics of brood parasitism and host defense be
              understood.  This
knowledge could be of importance with regard to conservation
              of avian
diversity.
