Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of software to facilitate the
              understanding and use of brain model simulations.  The project is based on the
              GENESIS neural simulation system developed over the last 12 years in the
              laboratory of the principal investigator.  GENESIS is now used in many
              laboratories throughout the world as a tool to help construct and run brain
              models at many levels of brain organization from subcellular to whole networks
              and systems.  This project will develop a modeler's workspace to help find,
              organize, and visualize the data on which these simulations are based.  In
              addition this project provides support to link numerous other existing
              neuroscience databases to the workspace.  Finally, the workspace will also
              provide a novel educational tool to allow students of neuroscience to
              understand both brain models and the areas of the brain they represent.
