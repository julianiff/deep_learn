Abstract    :
              9816780
Human alpha1, 3 fucosyltransferases (FTs) are biologically important
              enzymes that catalyze the final step in the synthesis of ligands for adhesion
              molecules and important antigens.  In spite of their important functions, very
              little  biochemical information exists on these proteins beyond a predicted
              amino acid sequence and the identification of a limited set of naturally
              occurring mutants.  The goal of the proposed research is to obtain information
              on the biochemistry of this class of enzymes, with the ultimate aim of
              identifying amino acids within these proteins that are involved in acceptor
              (e.g. oligosaccharides) and nucleotide sugar donor substrate binding, and
              catalysis.  Experiments will focus on identifying amino acids that are involved
              in the binding of the nucleotide sugar donor substrate.  In addition, an
              analysis of the disulfide bonding pattern of the FTs will be done by mass
              spectrometric analysis.  The information obtained from the combination of
              molecular biology, biochemistry and protein analysis will provide detailed
              information on this family of glycosyltransferases and this information will
              generate a model that can be utilized to design future studies of these
              important proteins.

Human alpha1,3 fucosyltransferases are biologically
              important proteins that calalyze the final step in the synthesis of binding
              partners for adhesion molecules and important antigens.  The goal of the
              proposed research is to obtain information on the biochemistry of this class of
              proteins, with the ultimate aim of identifying units of these proteins that are
              involved in reactant binding and catalysis.  Experiments will also focus on an
              analysis of critical linkages within the protein to define how the protein is
              folded into its active shape.
