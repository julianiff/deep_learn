This grant provides two years partial salary support for a
              technician to maintain and operate the VG Sector 54 thermal ionization mass
              spectrometer (TIMS) in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science (EPS),
              Washington University - St. Louis. This is a phase II technician support grant
              and follows three years of initial Phase I support (EAR-9506697).  As a
              condition of Phase II funding, Washington University has agreed to fully
              underwrite the salary for this technical position for a minimum of two years
              beyond the expiration of this award.
This geochronology lab continues to
              produce high precision isotopic analyses within the U/Pb, Sm/Nd and Rb/Sr
              radiogenic systems.  Current geochronologic studies of igneous and metamorphic
              rocks from Madagascar are providing valuable constraints on Neoproterozoic
              plate tectonics and the formation and subsequent breakup of
              Gondwanaland.
