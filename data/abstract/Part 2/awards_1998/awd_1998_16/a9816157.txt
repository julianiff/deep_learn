This LTREB-funded project will support continued data
              collection on net primary production and nutrient dynamics in control and
              fertilized plots of salt marsh vegetation at the former North Inlet LTER site.
              Stem populations of marsh cord grass have been recorded monthly on permanent
              plots in two high marsh sites, two low marsh sites, and one experimentally
              fertilized high marsh site. The existing long-term data on demography,
              productivity, and sediment chemistry are unique and have led to new insights
              about the regulation of marsh productivity. Additionally, existing primary
              productivity data will be supplemented with monthly measurements of sediment
              respiration. Preliminary data show that sediment respiration has increased in
              experimentally fertilized plots and that sediment carbon has decreased. These
              long-term measurements will yield basic information about interactions between
              belowground and aboveground processes, and a clearer understanding about the
              regulation of salt marsh primary production and carbon storage in coastal
              ecosystems. The structure and function of coastal wetlands will change as a
              consequence of eutrophication and global environmental changes. This research
              will yield data directly relevant to these issues.
