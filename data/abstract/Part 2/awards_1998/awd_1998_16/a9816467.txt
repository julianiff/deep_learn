              Abstract  ATM-9816467  Retelle, Michael J.  Bates College  Title: Paleoclimates
              from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE)  Steering Committee Activities    This
              award supports the coordination, synthesis, and data  management within the
              Paleoclimates from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries  (PALE) project of the ARCSS
              (Arctic System Science) and ESH (Earth  System History) programs.  These
              activities are beyond the scope of  individual research projects, but they are
              critical to PALE's  contribution to the Global Change effort.  PALE's goal is
              the  development of records that characterize the magnitude and spatio- 
              temporal variability of past climate changes at high northern  latitudes via
              multi-proxy indicators of paleoenvironments.  In  conjunction with climate
              modeling, PALE data provide information on  the probable causal factors and
              feedback effects that influence  past climate changes in the Arctic.  This in
              turn informs efforts  to predict the character and consequence of future
              climate change  at the global scale.
