                                       This grant is awarded through the  Interfacial,
              Transport and        Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division.        The principal investigator is Dr. Stephen Weber at the
              University of        Pittsburgh. A 1-day conference + workshop titled "New
              Developments in        Chemical Separations from Combinatorial Chemistry and
              Related        Synthetic Strategies" will be supported through this grant. The 
                    workshop will be held on August 22nd, 1998, at Boston, in conjunction    
                 with the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society. The role of       
              this conference/workshop is to bring scientists and engineers working        in
              separations science together to discuss novel ideas in        combinatorial
              chemistry that could speed up advances in separation        science. The power
              of combinatorial chemistry and related synthetic        strategies is being
              pursued intensively by the pharmaceutical industry        as an efficient way
              to drug development. The techniques developed by        the pharmaceutical
              companies have tremendous implications to materials        development and the
              question therefore arises - can combinatorial        synthesis and related
              strategies be used in the development of better        separations media?      
                     This conference + workshop seeks to address the question. In a       
              half-day session, plenary talks will be held to educate across the       
              barriers of discipline and scale (the conference aspect). In the        second
              half-day session, the partic ipants will break out into small        groups to
              develop new ideas. To summarize, a panel will convene to        discuss and
              comment on the results of the breakout groups. A full        report will be
              submitted to NSF on the results of the panel        discussions.
