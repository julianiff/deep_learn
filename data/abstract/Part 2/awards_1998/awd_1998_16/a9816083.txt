Abstract    :
              Jay

This project will investigate El Nino/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
              effects on the estuarine circulation through the 
analysis of suspended
              particulate matter (SPM) budgets. An important justification for the study is
              the observed 
correlation of West coast river outflows with ENSO cycles. The
              ENSO effects appeared to be amplified in fluvial 
SPM discharge since the
              latter typically varies non linearly (with a power greater than one) with the
              river discharge. 
The hypothesis that estuarine circulation will amplify ENSO
              signals in river outflow and SPM transport by altering 
the residual flow and
              the hydrodynamic trapping of particles will be tested in the Columbia River
              using historical 
and recent (1997-98 El Nino) data sets.
