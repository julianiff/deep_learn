Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will allow the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of
              Nebraska - Lincoln to acquire an impedance spectroscopy instrument.  Bernard
              Doudin, a junior faculty member whose research focuses on in situ
              characterization of materials synthesized using electrochemical techniques,
              including ferromagnets and nanostructured materials, will be the primary user
              of this equipment.  

Electrodeposition techniques have been shown to be a
              powerful method for fabricating magnetic layers.  They have been successfully
              and extensively used in the magnetic recording industry, for example.  This
              instrument will allow Doudin to monitor the properties of the magnetic
              materials while they are being fabricated; this will ultimately lead to a
              better understanding and control of the synthesis.  The goal is to make new
              magneto-electronics devices by exploiting  novel synthesis routes.
