Abstract    :
              In female rats, the gonadal hormones estrogen and progesterone modulate activity
              of the neurotransmitter, dopamine (DA), in the brain.  Experiments in this
              laboratory have been directed at defining the mechanisms mediating the effect
              of estrogen in the brain, as well as attempting to determine the functional
              role of this phenomena in the natural behavior of the rat.  With the latter in
              mind, we find that DA in one particular area of the brain, the striatum, is
              important for specific aspects of the female rat reproductive behavior.  The
              mechanism(s) mediating the effects of the gonadal hormones on the striatum
              appears to be different from those mediating the effects of estrogen and
              progesterone at intracellular (traditional) estrogen receptors.  Research from
              my laboratory has repeatedly demonstrated that estrogen acts in the striatum
              through a novel mechanism.  There are two key questions about the role of
              gonadal hormones in the modulation of DA activity in the female rat that the
              experiments in this proposal will address: 1) What are the mechanism(s)
              mediating the effects of estrogen on the striatum?; and 2) What role(s) of the
              striatum, and of DA release, in reproductive behavior in the female rat?
The
              involvement of the gonadal steroid hormones in the modulation of striatal DA
              activity is important for our understanding of the basic processes of
              neuroendocrinology as well as our understanding of the functions of the basal
              ganglia.  Identifying novel mechanisms through which steroid hormones act in
              the brain has important implications for our understanding of where, how, and
              when these hormones affect the brain activity and behavior.  Finally, these
              experiments will help us to understand how these hormones modulate behavior in
              the female rat.
