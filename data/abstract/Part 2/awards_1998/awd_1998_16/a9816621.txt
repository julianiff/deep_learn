This project involves the second three years of a summer
              institute in research design in cultural anthropology.   Experts in research
              design and in the link between data and theory will teach a set of 12-15
              graduate students chosen competitively from Ph.D. programs throughout the US
              during a period of 3 weeks.   Course content will cover a broad spectrum of
              issues focusing on the link between theory and the development of research
              objectives, concepts, definitions, variables, measures and hypotheses; the
              relationship between quantitative and qualitative approaches in the
              ethnographic context; systematic data collection procedures; probability and
              non-probability sampling; statistical distributions and elementary data
              analysis. The emphasis will be on concepts (e.g., sampling theory), an
              introduction to data management in both a qualitative and quantitative context,
              and strategies of hypothesis testing.   
This project is important because it
              will provide an introduction to research issues in scientific anthropology for
              graduate students who may not be receiving an adequate exposure to these issues
              in their departments.  The results of this workshop should be to increase the
              competence of students to do significant dissertation research projects and to
              become more proficient social scientists in general.
