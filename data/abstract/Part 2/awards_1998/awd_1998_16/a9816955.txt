Abstract    :
              It funds a Grantees' Workshop for the Computation and Social Systems (CSS)
              program, which supports research on computing and communications in groups,
              organizations, social communities, markets and society.  The program's grantees
              have focused on two streams of research.  One is on the integration,
              sustainable use, and impacts of information technology; the other is on
              theories and technologies for reasoning, decisionmaking, integration,
              communication and collaboration. The workshop examines problems, issues and
              opportunities related to the evolution of CSS research community and the CSS
              Program's place in NSF and in the larger research world.  It convenes active
              researchers from CSS-related disciplines to focus on significant issues facing
              the CSS community, help institutionalize CSS research by building on previous
              CSS and related workshops, and communicate the research goals, results and key
              activities of the CSS community.  The workshop uses small groups to develop
              specific objectives, and plenary sessions for delivering group reports and
              reaching consensus on issues dealt with by the small groups. The planning
              committee and selected participants prepare individual chapters of the final
              report to be circulated electronically for review, and then published for
              distribution along with an executive summary and executive presentation slides.
