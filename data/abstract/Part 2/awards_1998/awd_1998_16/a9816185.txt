              ABSTRACT: CMS-9816185, Leslie Youd, Brigham Young U.

Over the past
              twenty-five years, a procedure, termed the "simplified procedure", has evolved
              to evaluate the seismic liquefaction resistance of soils: it has become the
              standard of practice in North America and throughout much of the world. This
              procedure has been corrected and augmented periodically since then. In 1985,
              Professor Robert Whitman convened a workshop at MIT on behalf of the National
              Research Council (NRC), in which thirty-six experts and observers thoroughly
              reviewed the state-of-knowledge and the state-of-the-art for assessing the
              liquefaction hazard. That workshop produced a report (NRC, 1985) that has
              become a widely used standard and reference for liquefaction hazard
              assessment.

No general review or update of the simplified procedures was
              made following the 1985 workshop until a workshop was convened in January 1996.
              At that meeting, twenty experts reviewed developments since 1985, in order to
              arrive at a consensus on improvements that could be recommended for engineering
              practice. The proceedings were published by the sponsor, the National Center
              For Earthquake Engineering Research, as Technical Report NCEER 97-0022.
              Consensus was achieved on several, but not all, proposed enhancements to the
              state of the art. For example, liquefaction resistance procedures based on cone
              penetration test (CPT) data were endorsed by several key members of the
              workshop, but not all. This tool is widely used in geotechnical engineering
              practice and a consensus statement from the workshop group on CPT methodologies
              is badly needed. Subsequent to this workshop, several of the participants
              tested the CPT procedures discussed at the workshop, and the results obtained
              are considered to be sufficient to overcome past concerns.

A major goal of
              the second meeting is to evaluate these additional results, and to gain a
              consensus on CPT procedures. Additional issues where enhanced recommendations
              may be possible include: fines-content corrections, magnitude scaling factors,
              and correction for high overburden pressures. The objective of the reconvened
              workshop is to produce consensus revisions to the Summary Report, and to
              prepare a final draft for submission to a major journal for broad dissemination
              to the geotechnical engineering profession.
