This award supports a three-month visit by graduate student,
              Robert Klee, Yale University, to the International Center for Antarctic
              Information and Research (ICAIR) in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The goal of the
              research is to generate a management plan for the existing scientific research
              "industry" in Antarctica to help increase energy efficiency, to encourage reuse
              and recycling, and to apply waste minimization techniques.  Two industrial
              ecology techniques will be employed in the evaluation of scientific research
              installations in Antarctica: Materials Flow Analysis and Design-for-Environment
              matrix analysis.
