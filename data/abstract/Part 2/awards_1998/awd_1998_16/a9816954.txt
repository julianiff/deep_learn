              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:    Environmentally Benign CO Insertion  Proposal
              Number:   CTS-9816954  Principal Investigators: Steven S. C. Chuang 
              Institution:    University of Akron    The proposal objective is to develop
              fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synthesis of alkyl or aryl
              carbamate/isocyanate by direct carbonylation of the amine or nitrocompound,
              over Pd/Al2O3 or Lewis-acid promoted catalysts, e.g. AlCl3-Pd/SiO2. The
              mechanistic study would involve the characterization of surface intermediates
              and rate determining steps. It will also reveal the role of Lewis acidity and
              basicity in promoting CO insertion. The study will also include the synthesis
              of Pd/Al2O3/MCM-41 catalysts by CVD of Pd carbonyl and trimethylaluminum. 
              Experimental techniques include infrared spectroscopy, transient and steady
              state isotopic kinetics, and surface analysis.  The primary importance of the
              work is the identification of single-step routes to the industrial synthesis of
              isocyanate/carbamate, alternative to the currently commercial process using the
              hazardous phosgene and amines. Isocyanates and carbamates are used as fine
              chemical and pharmaceutical intermediates.
