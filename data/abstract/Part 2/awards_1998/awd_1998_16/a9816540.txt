Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Kevin S. Peters at the University of Colorado at
              Boulder.   The research aims to understand the influences of driving force,
              solvent, temperature, and deuterium isotope substitution on the kinetics and
              mechanism of proton transfer in solution, using a picosecond absorption
              spectrometer developed under a prior grant.  The molecules used in this study
              will include derivatives of 2-(N-methyl-amino)-alpha-acetophenone and
              2-(anilinomethyl)-benzophenone.   The findings will be examined considering two
              recently developed theories which view proton transfer as occurring exclusively
              through a tunneling process controlled by solvent fluctuations.

Proton
              transfer plays a role in many organic and biochemical reactions.   The work
              that Dr. Peters proposes to do should provide valuable insights into the
              detailed mechanisms of this important class of reactions.
