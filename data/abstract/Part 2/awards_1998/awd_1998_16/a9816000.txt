The objective of this award  is to upgrade the
              computing facilities needed to support the eucational and research objectives
              of the meteorology program at the College of Charleston.  The education of 
              students and their access to research-grade data would benefit greatly by the
              creation and equipping of a student-oriented weather center.  Specifically, the
              upgrades  will include a Sun Ultra5 system capable of handling UNIDATA's
              McIDAS, a Lexmark Optra Laser Printer, a HP Inkjet color plotter, and
              networking upgrades to handle the high datarate.  These capabilities would
              allow the College of Charleston to greatly enhance the education of meteorology
              students, and their interaction in research.
