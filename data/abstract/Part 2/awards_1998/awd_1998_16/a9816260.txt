Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will allow the Chemistry Department at the University of Akron to
              purchase optical instrumentation for time-resolved spectrometry.  This
              equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty David A. Modarelli, whose
              research focuses on nanoscale dendritic photosynthetic mimics.  

The studies
              supported here are directed toward the development of polymeric systems capable
              of mimicking photosynthesis.  Solar energy conversion by means of
              photosynthetic mimics represents a potent approach toward addressing current
              energy needs.
