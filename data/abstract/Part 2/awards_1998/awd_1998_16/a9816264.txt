McKeegan
This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a state-of-the-art, automated scanning electron microscope (SEM) to support
              ongoing ion microprobe (IMP) research at UCLA.  The UCLA IMP lab is operated as
              a national multi-user facility for which it receives on-going support through
              the Division of Earth Sciences' Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) program
              (EAR9806639) to allow geoscientists across the country and internationally,
              access to the large-radius Cameca 1270 IMP for microscale isotopic studies of
              terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples.  In particular, faculty at UCLA
              specialize in U/Pb zircon geochronology (Harrison), oxygen isotopic studies of
              interplanetary dust and Ca-Al rich inclusions in chondrites (McKeegan) and U/Th
              series dating of young volcanics (Reid).
