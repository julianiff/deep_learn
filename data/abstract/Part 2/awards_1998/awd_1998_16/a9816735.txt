This workshop project is to explore the breadth of  the topic
              of home health care technologies and identify significant areas of research
              which remain unexplored or unexploited.  A key outcome of the project would be
              a report that: identifies major trends and areas expecting or needing
              development; prioritizes areas where an expansion of science and engineering
              knowledge is necessary; identifies potential gaps or barriers in moving from
              product development and design to delivery of effective and safe technologies,
              and helps establish a collaborative infrastructure that would effectively
              address longer-term needs and problems in this area. 

The workshop project
              will be conducted in two steps.  The first step is to conduct a Mini-Workshop
              of 1¢ days in the fall of 1998 to refine an agenda for the full workshop and to
              facilitate preparation of documents for pre-distribution to the Full Workshop
              participants.  Participants would be a core team of 12-15 (organizers,
              facilitators and panel co-chairs).  The second step is to hold the 2¢ day Full
              Workshop in the Spring of 1999 that would produce the report mentioned above. 
              Participants are to  include a core of 30 invited speakers and panelists, up to
              30 paid registrants, and up to 20 invited observers.  The workshop organizers
              are to be advised by an advisory board of experts in the important aspects of
              home care technologies.  Major stakeholders would be represented in the
              workshop: biomedical engineering research, medical science, nursing, allied
              health, telemedicine, computer science, health policy/health economics;
              government; industry; users (patient advocacy).  The project is partially
              supported by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food
              and Drug Administration (FDA).

The workshop project is the first
              comprehensive examination of this rapidly developing area of health care
              technology.
