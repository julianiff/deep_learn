Abstract    :
              IBN-9816076  Silver    Funds are requested to organize a one day workshop, on
              the  CSF as a communication pathway of the brain to be held prior  to the
              Society for Neuroscience meeting in November 1998.  The aim of this workshop is
              to bring together investigators  who have interests in the brain. Invited
              speakers will  discuss the pros and cons of existing evidence, consider the 
              potential relevance of CSF signaling to neurologic and  psychiatric disorders,
              and develop a set of criteria for  identification physiological role of Csf
              signaling, as has  been done for synaptic transmission. The criteria for 
              identification of a CSF signal will be published in a  scientific journal and
              will constitute a reference and  standard against which researchers can
              evaluate the strength  of their individual research results and paradigms.
