Groza 
     Although the metal casting process is often desirable for
              the production of complex netshape parts, the emission of volatile hydrocarbons
              has placed increasingly severe restrictions upon the industry as a result of
              ambient air quality regulations on foundry operations. These emissions arise
              from the pyrolysis of the organic binders in the mold and core sand. This Small
              Grants for Exploratory (SGER) project proposes to investigate the reformulation
              of the binders that are necessary for the mold-making, by looking to a
              synthetic carbonate cement alternative. This material would allow bonding of
              the silica particles for the casting process with a reduction in the volatiles
              by the substitution of more benign materials.  This SGER will demonstrate the
              ability of the synthetic to serve as a substitution for the binder under
              conditions typically found in metal casting. 
      This experimentation will
              provide the information necessary to demonstrate the suitability of the
              material as a molding agent, including the post-casting material
              characteristics for waste-stream handling.  It is a novel approach to a
              significant environmental problem for the manufacturing community.  There is
              high potential for its use if the expectations of properties for molding and
              for post-casting waste handling can be met.
