Abstract    :
              The goal of the PI Conference for NSF Projects Related to  Technology Education
              is to create and enhance linkages among  Advanced Technological Education
              (ATE), Instructional  Materials Development (IMD) and Teacher Enhancement (TE) 
              programs.  A conference will be held in Washington, D.C. on  November 18 and
              19, 1998.  Approximately 40 principal  investigators will have the opportunity
              to "showcase" their  projects.  Selected leaders from the ATE and technology 
              education communities will be invited to participate as  well, NSF program
              officers will present on "Relationships  Among ATE, IMD and TE Projects." 
              Panels of three principal  investigators will address issues such as: 
              "Developing  standards-based curricula," "Strategies for enhancing the  impact
              of projects," and, "Working with publishers."  A  rapporteur will listen
              throughout the conference and make  reflective comments concerning the issues
              addressed.  He  will also make recommendations for further research.  Based  on
              the rapporteur's report, panelist's one-page comments and  reports, and the
              conference evaluation a manuscript will be  prepared for submission to a
              national journal.
