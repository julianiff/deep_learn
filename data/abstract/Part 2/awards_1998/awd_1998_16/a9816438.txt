The goal of the proposed research is to determine the
              general applicability of a newly proposed model of thermal adaptation in
              biological membranes.  The goal of the proposed research is to determine the
              adaptive significance to conserving the dynamic phase behavior (i.e., the
              ability of membrane lipids to undergo local rearrangements necessary for
              fusion, budding, cell division and intracellular membrane vesicle trafficking)
              of membrane lipids in multicellular or poikilothermic animals.  The predictions
              of this dynamic phase behavior model will be tested in various membrane
              fractions from temperature-acclimated fish adapted to both cold and warm water
              and, in selected experiments, rat.  The significance of the proposed work lies
              in better understanding how membrane lipids influence membrane function and has
              implications for both disease processes that are membrane based as well as the
              impact of global warming on natural populations.
