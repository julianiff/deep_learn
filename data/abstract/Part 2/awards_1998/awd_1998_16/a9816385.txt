This project involves the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from the University of North Carolina who will study
              how a society of agro-pastoralists living in Siberia is adjusting to a
              post-Soviet Union economic and social reality.  After being forced into
              collectivized production systems, they are now free to develop their own mode
              of subsistence.  Using ethnographic methods of comprehensive life histories of
              a sample of elders of a village of 4,000 Sakha people, archival research into
              the history of Soviet control, time allocation and random spot observation,
              interviews, participant observation and sample surveys, the student will try to
              understand how this society is adapting to the loosening of Soviet constraints
              and the opening of new opportunities for development. She will see whether
              people adapt a traditionalist, revivalist, or forward-looking orientation, and
              whether they adopt a small-holder model of subsistence after their collective
              experience.  Her understanding will be tested and refined by surveys in other
              villages in the last two  months of the project. 
This research will advance
              our knowledge of this important region of the world as well as contribute to
              the training of a young social scientist.
