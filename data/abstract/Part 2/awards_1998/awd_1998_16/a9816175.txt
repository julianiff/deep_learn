This three-year award in support of U.S.-France collaborative
              research in polymer materials involves Randolph Duran of the University of
              Florida's Engineering Research Center in Particulate Science and Yves Gnanou of
              the Ecole Normale Superieure de Physique et de Chimie in Bordeaux, France.  The
              grant will principally support the participation of US graduate students and
              undergraduates in research activities and experiments in Bordeaux.  The
              objective of the research is the synthesis and characterization of a series of
              well-defined, amphiphilic star-block copolymers.  Among the branched
              architectures, star polymers present the most elementary means of arranging the
              sub chains since each star contains only one branch point.  Well-defined star
              polymers represent useful models for the study of the relation between their
              molecular structures and the microscopic properties in solution or in solid
              state.

The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise on
              characterization of polymers.  This is complemented by French expertise in
              polymer synthesis.  The collaboration takes advantage of facilities in Florida
              and at the Advanced Photon Source Synchrotron.
