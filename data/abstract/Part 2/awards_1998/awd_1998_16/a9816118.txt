	This project is a comparative ethnographic study of
              environmental activism in four adjoining urban neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New
              York City.  The project, by a cultural anthropologist from New York University,
              will study how race, class and ethnic differences interact to influence the
              responses of local communities to urban restructuring.  The neighborhoods are
              Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Carol Gardens/Park Slope, and Red Hook, all located in
              West Brooklyn yet composed of socially and ethnically diverse populations. 
              Using participant observation over two years the investigator will examine how
              the four communities respond to development projects including the siting of a
              waste-transfer station on the waterfront; the reconstruction of an expressway;
              the construction of a rail freight tunnel, and the private development of large
              malls, multiplex cinemas and other private facilities.  The focus of the
              project will be on the creation of coalitions across racial, cultural and class
              lines.  This research will provide valuable information on how local
              sub-communities organize to cooperate over issues of common interest.  The
              analysis of how such coalitions function will be a valuable corrective to the
              common view of such urban neighborhoods as unable to construct a civil society
              because of the inability to cooperate and bridge internal divisions.  The new
              information to be collected will be of interest to planners and politicians in
              New York City as well as in other similar urban places.
