Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to support a symposium entiled "Historical,
              Philosophical and Empirical Perspectives on Animal Consciousness." The
              symposium will be held under the auspices of the 1999 annual metting of the
              Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology that will be held in Denver.
              This symposuim will bring together anthropologists, biologists, philosophers of
              pyscholog, and conflicting views concerning the history and philosophy, and
              historians and philosophers of science to present and discuss their conflicting
              views concerning the history and philosophy of scientific claims and
              assumptions about animal sentience. The participants have been carefully chosen
              to represent facets of the many-sided debates that surround the issue of animal
              consciousness. They include many of the most distinguished and important
              scholars and scientist in their fields. Participants in the symposium,and
              readers of its proceedings, will be compelled to focus on the difficulties that
              science has in dealing with subjective experience. The symposium will raise
              this issue in a debate that brings togather scientists, philsophers, and
              historians to discuss a topic of mutal interest.
