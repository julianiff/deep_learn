Abstract    :
              Abstract - Subramaniam - 9816969    This research program will rationally
              exploit supercritical (sc) reaction media to develop new, environmentally-safer
              and selective processes for such important catalytic reactions as acid
              catalyzed 1-butene/isobutane alkylation to produce gasoline, skeletal
              isomerization of n-butane to isobutane and selective functional groups
              hydrogenations on supported catalysts.  The goals include (i) the optimization
              of the cosolvent-based supercritical solid-acid alkylation process (recently
              developed in our laboratory) to obtain enhanced alkylate yields at high butene
              conversion; (ii) the application of the in situ sc decoking concept to extend
              the life of low-temperature, solid-acid skeletal isomerization catalysts; and
              (iii) the optimization of solid-catalyzed sc hydrogenation process by
              pressure-tuning solvent and transport properties in the near-critical region to
              achieve desired product selectivity and hydrogenation rates.    Besides
              providing a better fundamental understanding of the physicochemical  processes
              underlying heterogeneous fluid/solid catalysis in sc media, the catalyst
              systems developed in this research are likely to impact the refining and
              chemical industries by minimizing chemical waste while optimizing catalyst
              selectivity, efficiency and lifetime.  Specifically, solid-acid catalyzed
              alkylation and isomerization processes with enhanced activity and product
              yields could emerge as commercially-viable, environmentally-safer alternatives
              to liquid-acid based processes.  Continuous solid-catalyzed hydrogenation in sc
              media - characterized by pressure-tunable selectivities minimizing waste
              formation, enhanced reaction rates, and inherently safer operation due to
              decreased holdup of hazardous reagents in the reactor - could emerge as an
              attractive process for functional groups' hydrogenations, a subject critical to
              the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical and food industries.
