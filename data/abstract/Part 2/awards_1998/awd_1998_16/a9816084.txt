Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9816084  Strauss    This award to the Oregon State University is
              to study the feasibility of establishing an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Tree Genetic Engineering. The proposed center will conduct
              research on the adaptation of existing genetic technologies, and will
              investigate areas of basic science, of direct relevance to forest industries.
              The initial portfolio of research projects, and the structure and organization
              of the proposed center will be discussed at an  industry/university workshop to
              be held at the end of the grant period.
