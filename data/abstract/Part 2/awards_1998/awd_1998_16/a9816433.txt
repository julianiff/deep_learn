Title: Request for Travel Grant for the XXVI International
              Ethological Conference to be held in Bangalore, India 1999

This request is
              to provide support for up to 14 young scientists that would help defray the
              costs of attending the XXVI International Ethological Congress.  This is the
              most important international ethological meeting held.  It will attract
              participants from all over the world.  In the past this conference has been
              extremely well attended and successful.
Attendance at this meeting will be
              very beneficial to the young scientists who otherwise would be unable to
              participate in this international gathering.  Contacts for future international
              collaborations will be made and interchange of ideas will occur.
