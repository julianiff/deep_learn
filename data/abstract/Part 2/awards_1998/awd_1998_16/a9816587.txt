Abstract    :
              Learning and memory are topics that are at the core of understanding how the
              brain works, and represent one of the extremely active areas of neuroscience
              research today.  This conference provides a forum for the organized exchange of
              information, techniques and discovery in this rapidly growing and critically
              important field.  The theme is the biological substrates of learning and
              memory, at all levels from molecular biology to behavior and computation, and
              include work on invertebrates as well as vertebrates.  Two key topics of
              current excitement that are emphasized include molecular biology and
              computational approaches. 
   The impact on neuroscience will come from the
              close interactions across different approaches presented at this conference,
              and from attendance by young investigators and those from underrepresented
              groups, to have an impact on their careers.
