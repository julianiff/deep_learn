Abstract    :
              DMI-9816978  Blucher  The exploratory research is a plan to determine the
              feasibility of a newly discovered novel metal matrix composite (MMC) processing
              method for continuous fiber.  The aim is to investigate the implications of the
              interface reactions for various materials and size combinations of fibers
              studied. Test equipment will be designed and built to determine reliable
              viscosity, surface tension and friction data on the molten matrix materials in
              combination with the fibers as they are processed through orifices with special
              geometries.   This information is necessary for the modeling of the process.
              The influence of the fiber surface structure on the infiltration and interface
              formation will be studied and related to the mechanical properties of the
              composite. This experimental work will proof out the feasibility of a new
              method of controlled continuous fiber MMC production. This SGER has high
              potential for future industrial commercialization for the production of MMCs
              that can meet specific mechanical property requirements, if the designed
              orifice technique proves viable. It is expected that if successful, the data
              gathered and the preliminary model developed will advance the knowledge of MMCs
              and will lead to further process optimization.
