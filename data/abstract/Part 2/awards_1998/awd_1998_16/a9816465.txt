Abstract    :
              This project will, jointly with the British Antarctic Survey, construct and
              deploy an all-sky airglow imager at the BAS Halley Bay station.  This
              instrument will provide data on mesospheric temperatures and gravity wave
              structure in a larger effort to quantify the coupling between the geospace
              environment and the Earth's neutral atmosphere. 
	
Gravity waves,
              particularly small-scale, short-period waves, are known to play an important
              role in the transfer of energy between their lower altitude source regions and
              the mesosphere.  Their occurrence and characteristics at high latitudes have
              however not yet been observed and examined at the level of detail that will be
              possible under this project.  It is timely because it will coincide with the
              launch of NASA's TIMED satellite (Thermosphere/Ionosphere/Mesosphere Energetics
              and Dynamics), a small remote sensing and imaging spacecraft.  The satellite,
              together with ground-based observations, will achieve a quantitative
              understanding of the energetics and dynamics of the mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere-ionosphere between altitudes of  ~50 and 200 km. This is a
              transition region where temperature variations are large and increase
              dramatically with altitude, and where atmospheric motions are dominated by
              gravity waves and tides.
