Abstract    :
              Previous studies have shown that NMDA receptors mediate much of the normal
              synaptic transmission in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells of the supraoptic
              nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON).  Dr. Curras's laboratory has recently shown
              that osmotic activation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial axis produces
              upregulation of the glycine-binding subunit of the NMDA receptor, NMDAR1. These
              changes in NMDAR1 expression are specific to the SON and paraventricular
              nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) suggesting that NMDA receptors are also
              involved in neuroendocrine function. 

    Recent molecular cloning studies
              have identified five NMDA receptor subunits: NMDAR1 and NMDAR2A-D. In the adult
              SON all but the NMDAR2A gene are expressed. Preliminary studies in the
              investigator's laboratory have detected robust expression of NMDAR2B and
              NMDAR2D subunit and light expression of NMDAR2A and NMDAR2C subunits. One of
              the goals of the proposed research is to examine the subunit composition of
              functional NMDA receptors present on neurons of the SON. Western blot analysis
              and patch-clamp electrophysiology combined with pharmacological strategies will
              be used to examine the NMDA receptor structure and function indicative of
              subunit composition. Since functional NMDA receptors are believed to be
              composed of NMDAR1 and at least one NMDAR2 subunit, it is proposed to examine
              expression changes induced by osmotic activation of the glutamate-binding
              subunit, NMDAR2B.
