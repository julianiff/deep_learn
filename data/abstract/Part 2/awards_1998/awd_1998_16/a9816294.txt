Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert Bau, Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division to investigate unusual systems/structures with four-,
              seven- and eight-coordinate hydride ligands by neutron diffraction techniques
              and to probe how hydrogen interacts with metallic systems. The mobility of the
              hydride ligands will also be investigated by the nuclear magnetic resonance
              method at low temperatures.

Three-dimentional structures of metallic-hydride
              clusters systems will be obtained. Graduate students will be trained in the
              synthesis of these difficult systems.
