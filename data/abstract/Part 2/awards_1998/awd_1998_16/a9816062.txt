The Graduate Research Seminar in Bioinorganic Chemistry, Gordon Research
              Conference (GRS) provides graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the
              field of bioinorganic chemistry with an opportunity to present their research.
              This Gordon Conference will next be held in Ventura, California from January 28
              - 31, 1999. GRS was created in 1996 because the Metals in Biology Gordon
              Conference (MIB) was regularly over-subscribed and therefore highly selective,
              denying many qualified young scientists the opportunity to participate. Thus
              far GRS has been a huge success, with attendance nearly doubling from 46 in
              1997 to 83 in 1998. The attendees and the faculty discussion leaders agreed
              that presentations and discussions at this conference were among the very best
              they had seen. In 1999 the topics to be emphasized will include: (1) Model
              Systems for Metalloprotein Active Sites; (2) Metals and Metabolism; (3)
              Metalloprotein Structure and Function; (4) Electron Transfer Reactions; and (5)
              Metal/Metalloprotein-Nucleic Acid Interactions. Because of the wide diversity
              of the topics addressed under the category of bioinorganic chemistry, this
              meeting provides its participants with an excellent opportunity to learn about
              research that relates directly to their own, and to broaden their understanding
              of the field. In addition, the session held on January 28th overlaps with the
              Metals In Biology Gordon Conference, providing networking and brainstorming
              opportunities with the leaders in the field.
