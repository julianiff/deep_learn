Abstract    :
              9816232  Cannon  This is a high risk, high potential project to investigate a
              novel method to reduce volatile organic compound ( VOCs) emissions in green
              sand metal casting. This pollution prevention would be accomplished by
              exploring the chemical reactions that take place when the sonoperoxone process
              for the binders in green sand molds is integrated with plasma processing
              techniques. In the metal casting industry, a major problem arises when chemical
              reactions take place between the liquid metal and the mold sand/binder. During
              shakeout, the collection and handling of the used sand and the airborne
              particulates constitutes a major waste-stream expense. This proposed process is
              aimed at reclaiming much of the waste sand for reuse, with significant
              reduction of the VOCs to be controlled by the integrated process.   This
              addresses the decarbonization issues identified in the current Metal Casting
              Roadmap under construction by the American Foundrymens Society, the Cast Metals
              Coalition, et al under the sponsorship of the Department of Energy. It is
              significant that it is a GOALI project as well, with an industrial collaborator
              coming to the academic campus to collaborate in the experimental work.
