Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9816302  KAPOOR    Machining is one of the prime components of
              manufacturing technology.  Maintaining leadership in this area is vital to U.S.
              productivity and economics.  The University of Illinois Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Machine Tool Systems Research plays an
              important role in maintaining the U.S. position in this industry.    The I/UCRC
              for Machine Tool Systems Research continues to meet the I/UCRC Program
              requirements for the second five year continuing grant.     The Center's
              research addresses projects in 1.) Agile/Flexible Machine Tool Structures,   
              2.)  Machining Process Modeling and Simulation,  3.)  Machine Tool
              System-Planning and Control, and 4.) Machining Process Development and
              Innovation.
