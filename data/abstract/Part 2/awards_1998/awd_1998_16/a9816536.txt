Abstract    :
              El-Shall is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study
              the kinetics and mechanisms of gas phase and cluster polymerization, with the
              goals of understanding elementary ionic polymerization systems relevant to
              basic and applied polymer science.  Research objectives include the
              characterization of initiation, reactivities, and temperature-dependent
              kinetics of cationic copolymerization, structure determination of oligomers and
              cyclization products, elucidation of solvent effects, and investigations of
              metal-catalyzed polymerization.  A gas phase ion chromatography (IC) instrument
              will be constructed and used to perform the kinetic and equilibrium
              thermochemistry measurements.  The outcomes from these studies are expected to
              find applications that promote direct technological gains in the development of
              gas phase polymerization.

The synthesis of polymers using solvent-free
              methods eliminates the need for distillation, drying, and solvent recovery.
              This means that operating costs associated with polymeric material production
              could be reduced in some industrial applications.  As well, gas phase
              polymerization approaches can be used to produce defect-free uniform thin
              polymer films of controlled morphology and composition.  Such materials could
              have technological applications as protective coatings and electrical
              insulators.  This research project provides unique education and training
              opportunities for a diverse group of students at Virginia Commonwealth
              University.
