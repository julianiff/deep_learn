Abstract    :
              
Many signaling proteins are recruited or regulated by the D-3
              phosphoinositides (PI (3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3.  These D-3 phosphoinositides
              serve as membrane localization elements that recruit different signaling
              enzymes to specific locations on the plasma membrane.  The target proteins
              contain unique D-3 phosphoinositide-recognition motifs that serve as the
              primary signal transducers enabling the protein to be recruited or regulated by
              these lipid second messengers to initiate downstream signaling.  Since these
              phosphoinositides represent a minor component of the phospholipids, the
              question is how is their binding specificity achieved.   This research is aimed
              at determining how they specifically bind to their target proteins.  In the
              first project src homology 2 (SH2) domains and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains
              will be used to investigate the structural basis for phosphoinositide binding
              specificity.  Based on previous work on the SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory
              subunit of PI 3-kinase, Dr. Chen has proposed consensus sequences for
              PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 binding.  In this study other SH2 and PH domains will
              be examined. Different strategies including site-directed mutagenesis will be
              used to test his working model for the binding selectivity.  Moreover a
              combinatorial peptide library approach will be employed to identify structural
              factors that control the binding affinity.  Since the sequence analysis
              suggests that calmodulin-binding motifs on some regulatory proteins share
              homology with the PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2 binding sequence, a hypothesis is
              proposed that these phosphoinositides may exert enzyme regulation through the
              control of calmodulin (CaM) availability to cellular targets.  During cell
              activation, D-3 phosphoinositides may increase CaM availability by sequestering
              CaM-binding proteins.  Thus the binding profiles of these CaM binding peptide
              fragments will be examined, as well as other experiments to test this.  Since
              phospholipid-protein interactions are a driving force for transmembrane signal
              transduction, understanding the molecular basis of this recognition will aid in
              the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of many cellular functions.
