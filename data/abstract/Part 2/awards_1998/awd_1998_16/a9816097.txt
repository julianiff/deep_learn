Over
              the past 20 years, Dr. Winser Alexander has successfully promoted the
              advancement of African American students, by providing sound advice and
              mentoring at the graduate and precollege levels.  Dr. Alexander has
              successfully recruited African American students into graduate engineering
              resulting in enrollments of approximately 10 Ph.D. students each year from
              underrepresented groups over the last several years.  The Department of
              Electrical Engineering at NCSU has had eight African American Ph.D. graduates
              over the last 10 years; Dr. Alexander has mentored all of them.  Dr. Alexander
              is also involved in tutoring and mentoring African American high school
              students on a weekly basis.
