Abstract    :
              The proposal research is to investigate fundamental issues regarding long fiber
              Bragg gratings in  two important areas:  first, the stabilization of the
              fabrication process by a new approach for real-time adaptive grating writing,
              and second, the methodology of synthesis of long gratings based on inverse
              scattering method for optimum design.  Both of these are important issues that
              are holding back progress in the field.  The fiber Bragg gratings have a broad
              impact on optical communications, particularly on dispersion management, and
              optical pulse shaping.
