Dopamine
              is required in several physiological contexts in the fruit fly Drosophila
              melanogaster, where it functions as a signaling molecule in developmental,
              reproductive and behavioral pathways. Given its multiple roles, the levels of
              dopamine must be precisely regulated in diverse tissues at different times
              throughout the life of the animal. Behavioral abnormalities may arise from
              disruption of normal dopaminergic neurotransmission, or from abnormally
              developed tissues. To distinguish between these two essential roles for
              dopamine, this application proposes to identify adult behaviors that are
              affected when dopamine levels are disrupted during development. A second goal
              is to identify the DNA sequence elements necessary for normal expression of the
              gene which encodes the rate-limiting step in dopamine synthesis. Specific
              perturbation of dopaminergic transmission within the central nervous system is
              critical for eventual elucidation of the role of dopamine in the modulation of
              behaviors.   The multiple signaling roles for dopamine are both novel and
              vital, and appear to be evolutionarily conserved. The experiments outlined in
              this 
proposal demonstrate how the same signaling molecule may be recruited
              for use in several physiological contexts, and may have profound implications
              for the etiology of cognitive pathologies, including Parkinson's disease,
              schizophrenia, and depression.
