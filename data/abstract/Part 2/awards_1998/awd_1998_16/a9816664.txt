Abstract    :
              Since the 1930's, developmental biologists have studied the mechanisms of axial
              gradients and the establishment of polarity.  Although the early investigations
              offered descriptive information about morphogenesis they also emphasized the
              need for molecular approaches.  There is currently renewed enthusiasm that the
              techniques and approaches are now available to define these molecular events. 
              With regard to the present research, it was shown several years ago that a
              phosphatase activity (5'NT ) appeared during the time course of cell
              differentiation in Dictyostelium and that the activity becomes restricted to a
              narrow band of cells that form the interface between the two differentiating
              cell types.  The activity was specific for 5'AMP and the activity domain
              extended from the external face of the plasma membrane.  There are two major
              goals of the project: (1) to identify the role played by this gene in the
              regulation of morphogenesis by disruption of expression of the 5'NT gene,
              overexpression and ectopic expression.  The resulting effects on morphogenesis
              will be determined through the analysis of cell-type specific markers and genes
              that are indicative of the progression of differentiation in the two major cell
              types, and (2) to identify the regulatory mechanisms that result in
              cell-specific expression of the 5'NT gene.  This will require identification of
              cis-acting factors that regulate the temporal and spatial expression, and
              identification and cloning of trans-acting factors that regulate expression of
              the gene.
