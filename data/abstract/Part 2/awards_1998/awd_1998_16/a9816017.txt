Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              program, focusses on the understanding of the basic mechanism of operation of
              conducting polymer gas sensors.  Experiments designed to probe the effect of
              work function modification on the sensitivity and behavior of doped polyaniline
              film materials in possible gas sensor applications are being carried out by
              Professor Janata and his coworkers at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  A
              detailed understanding of the chemical and physical mechanisms of operation of
              this class of sensor materials will be very useful in the design of more
              sensitive and more widely applicable gas sensor arrays for many environmental
              monitoring and control applications. 

Doped polymer sensing electrodes find
              wide application in a number of trace contaminant and pollutant monitoring
              applications.  The rational design of these sensor systems relies on an
              understanding of the chemical and physical mechanisms of operation of these
              materials.  This research project addresses the fundamental mechanisms of
              operation of these devices, probing the effects of systematic modification of
              the material work function on sensor sensitivity and selectivity.
