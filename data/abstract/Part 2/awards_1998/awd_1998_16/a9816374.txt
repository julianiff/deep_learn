Theoretical research will be conducted on the reaction
              dynamics of free radical polymerization and chemisorption at polymer
              interfaces.  The object of this renewal proposal is twofold:  extend earlier
              work on steady-state models of free-radical polymerization to non-steady state
              dynamics, and study chemisorption of multifunctionalized polymer chains onto
              functionalized solid surfaces from dilute solutions and from melts.  The
              reaction dynamics of free radical polymerization is driven by the competition
              between radical formation and radical termination processes, which are in turn
              driven by the statics and dynamics of the product polymer chains.  The proposed
              research will be coordinated with an interdisciplinary experimental
              free-radical polymerization at Columbia supported by the NSF Chemistry
              Division, and with a program in polymer chemisorption conducted at the SUNY
              Stony Brook MRSEC.

Reacting polymer systems are of great technological
              importance, being central to many applications of polymer synthesis and
              processing in the chemical, microelectronics, automotive, and aerospace
              industries.  They also play a major role in biology, because many chemical
              processes in living organisms involve reactive species incorporated into
              complex macromolecules.  The object of this research is to advance our
              understanding and ability to predict the reaction kinetics of polymers in the
              two areas of free-radical polymerization and interfacial chemisorption.  This
              improved understanding of chemical reaction rates should enhance our ability to
              tailor polymer properties by improved synthesis and processing
              techniques.
