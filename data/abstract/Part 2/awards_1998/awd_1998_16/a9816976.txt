Failure surfaces in macroscopic stress space of
              honeycombs, fiber reinforced composites and foams under triaxial loading are
              studiesd. Both macroscopic and microscopic failure surfaces are addressed
              within the scope of progressive failure of periodic solids. Correlation with
              experimental work will be established through collaborations with Prof.
              Kyriakides of University of Texas-Austin.***
