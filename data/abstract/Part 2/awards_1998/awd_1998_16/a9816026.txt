Abstract    :
              

Instructional methods in academe are shifting from a teacher-centered
              paradigm to a user-centered paradigm.  Advances in networking, digital
              libraries, and digital media technology are making the World Wide Web an
              effective framework for supporting this type of active learning.  This project
              will develop a set of prototype tools, processes, and an environment to provide
              preliminary answers to a set of questions that underly the design and
              implementation of a digital library for science, mathematics, and engineering
              education.  In particular, we will develop, run, collect data from, and analyze
              one student-centered computer science course.  This project builds on
              experience with the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library
              (NCSTRL) and work at Old Dominion University to develop NCSTRL+.
