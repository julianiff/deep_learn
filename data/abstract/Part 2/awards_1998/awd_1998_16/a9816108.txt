Abstract    :
              Membrane-based separations are attractive because of their simplicity, low
              energy costs, and ability to operate in remote locations.  Full utilization of
              the advantages of membrane technology, however, will require new membranes with
              increased permeabilities and selectivities.  Unfortunately, flux through
              membranes is generally inversely related to selectivity.  The development of
              ultrathin membranes will allow high flux, but synthesis of such structures with
              sufficient selectivity, strength, and quality is an ongoing challenge.  This
              proposal addresses the challenge of developing and understanding selective and
              ultrathin (< 50 nm) gas-separation membranes through the use of hyperbranched
              poly acrylic acid (PAA) films grafted onto porous supports.  PAA films will
              provide an ultrathin and selective layer while the highly permeable substrate
              is required for mechanical stability.  Hyberbranced PAA films will be unique
              membrane materials because their branched structure will allow full coverage of
              substrate pores, their layer-by-layer synthesis will yield films whose
              thickness can be varied from 3-100 nm, and the high density of carboxylic acid
              groups in the film will permit a wide range of chemical modifications even
              after membrane formation
