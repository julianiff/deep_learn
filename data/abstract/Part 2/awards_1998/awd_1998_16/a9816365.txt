Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research on carbon-sulfur bond cleavage in metal thiophene compounds
              by Dr. William D. Jones of the Chemistry Department, University of Rochester. 
              The main goal is to understand the fundamental chemistry of the interaction of
              thiophenes and other sulfur-containing compounds with transition metal
              fragments and, in so doing, improve the effectiveness of HDS catalysts.  The
              requirements and the detailed mechanism for cleavage of strong carbon-sulfur
              bonds will be investigated as well as the structural motifs for binding
              sulfur-containing organic compounds to metals.  Particular attention will be
              paid to metal sulfhydryl and sulfido compounds, their interconversion, and
              lability.  In addition, compounds containing tethered Cp-phosphine ligands with
              rhenium will be synthesized and their reactivity in HDS reactions
              investigated.

Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a process of removing sulfur
              from fossil fuels using molybdenum catalysts, sometimes with a nickel promoter.
               Current technology is marginal in meeting environmental regulations and needs
              to be improved.  This research will focus on understanding the role of nickel
              and other metals in breaking the C-S bond, the most problematic step in the HDS
              catalytic cycle.
