	This award supports the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from Case Western Reserve University.  The
              student will test the hypothesis that the social status of elders in a
              developing society is higher than the status of elders in a more developed
              society, after controlling for other determinants.  The project will take place
              in Samoa, comparing the more traditional Western and the more modernized
              American Samoa.  The student will collect data on the social and functional
              status of the elderly from a total of 600 ethnographic interviews with elders
              60 years old and older, younger adult family and  household members, and
              younger non-relative village residents.  The data will include age, sex,
              modernization variables including social, village and household level measures,
              social rank, and social status.  This research will advance our understanding
              of the modernization process and its outcomes.  At a time when the world's
              elderly population is growing rapidly and developing nations are in increasing
              contact with the Western world, increasing our in-depth understanding of the
              nature of elders' social status under changing socio-cultural conditions is of
              key importance.  In addition the research will contribute to the training of a 
              young social scientist and advance our understanding of this important region
              of the world.
