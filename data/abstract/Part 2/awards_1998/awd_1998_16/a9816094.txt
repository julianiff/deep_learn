Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the development of molecular imprinting
              techniques to create binding and catalytic sites for organic molecules in
              crosslinked polymer networks.  The term molecular imprinting refers to chemical
              techniques being developed that enable the synthesis of highly structured
              membranes and thin films.  These materials can subaequently be used to
              selectively transport organic molecules and other substrates through them. 
              Molecular imprinting is a rapidly expanding field that holds significant
              potential for providing novel materials with applications in chemical
              separations (like chromotography) and catalysis and chemical sensing.
