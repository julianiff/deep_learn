Abstract    :
              Proposal: CTS-9816469  PI:  Bruce C. Gates  Institution: University of
              California at Davis    Title: Novel Supported Metal Cluster Catalysts     
              ABSTRACT      The proposal is a new collaboration between Prof. Bruce Gates
              (U.C. Davis) and Prof. Miguel Valenzuela, Instituto Politecnico Nacional,
              Mexico, and colleagues Geolar Fetter and Pedro Bosch, of Universidad Autonoma
              Metropolitana, and Brent Handy, of Universidad Autonoma San Luis Potosi.  The
              main objective of the research is to test supported metal cluster catalysts
              prepared from metal carbonyl precursors. It is expected that small clusters of
              Ir and Rh will be stabilized on supports such as MoS2, hydrotalcites, and mixed
              oxides of Al and Mg. The structures will be determined with EXAFS, IR and 13C
              NMR spectroscopies. The physicochemical properties will be determined with
              chemisorption, TPD, and calorimetric measurements. The catalytic properties
              will involve toluene hydrogenation, and 2,2,3,3,-tetramethylbutane
              hydrogenolysis.
