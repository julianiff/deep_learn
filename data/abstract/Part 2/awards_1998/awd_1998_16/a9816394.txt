Abstract    :
              This is an in-depth study of molecular genetic variation in a large population
              of Native South Americans (the Yanomama of Venezuela and Brazil). While
              numerous studies have been conducted using classical blood group and protein
              markers in Native Americans, including the Yanomama, very few studies have been
              done using modern high-resolution molecular genetic markers (like the
              maternally inherited mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA), the paternally inherited Y
              chromosome DNA, and biparentally inherited short tandem repeat polymorphisms
              (STRs). Several dozen studies of varying sizes have analyzed mitochondrial DNA
              or Y chromosome variation in Native Americans, all of which involve studying
              less the 100, and often less than 20 individuals per population. This will be
              the first high resolution, multi-locus study of a single Native American
              population.  The researchers have samples from more than 3000 Yanomama from
              Venezuela and Brazil, from 52 villages. This represents actual DNA samples of
              1/4 to 1/5 of all the living Yanomama, and 1/3 of all the known Yanomama
              villages. Through extensive pedigree analysis, they also will know the mtDNA
              and Y chromosome types for another 3-5,000 relatives of the individuals in the
              sample, bringing the total sample up to 6-8,000 individuals.  They will analyze
              patterns of shared and exclusive variation among the 52 villages, as well as
              between the Yanomama and surrounding native populations. They are particularly
              interested in male and female-specific estimates of gene flow and migration
              (using the maternal mtDNA markers, the paternal Y markers, and the biparental
              STR markers).  If evolution is population genetics "writ large", then this
              study should provide a detailed study of microevolutionary structure in a
              large, sub-divided population, and this data may have important implications
              for larger models of human evolution and for models of the peopling of the New
              World.
