Abstract    :
                  9816193  Chang  This project is funded as part of the U.S./Japan Cooperative
               Research in urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation activity, a  U.S./Japan
              Common Agenda initiative.  The project aims to develop  a cross-cutting
              methodology for seismic risk assessment and  management of urban transportation
              infrastructure systems through  U.S./Japan research collaboration.  The
              approach integrates  engineering, systems analysis and economics.  Three
              related tasks  will be carried out: (1) Development of performance criteria and
               design of mitigation strategies, (2) modeling transportation and  economic
              system response in earthquake disasters, and (3) economic  evaluation of
              mitigation strategies.  In Task 1, the U.S. role will  consist of developing
              performance criteria based on transportation  accessibility measures, working
              with Japanese counterparts on  alternative criteria based, for example, on
              reliability  engineering, and designing associated retrofit and repair 
              strategies for evaluation in the transportation-economic model.   Research in
              Task 2 will focus on improving and expanding upon the  L.A. Highways model. 
              This effort will emphasize modeling of  earthquake damage repair and associated
              bottlenecks using  experience data from Kobe in order to evaluate the benefits
              of  faster network recovery.  Modeling expertise will be shared with  the
              Japanese team as they build similar models for Japan.  In Task  3, U.S. and
              Japanese researchers will collaborate on evaluating the  benefits and costs of
              retrofit and repair strategies, and assessing  the economic implications of the
              performance criteria identified in  Task 1.    This is a joint project carried
              out by investigators at the  University of Washington and the University of
              Southern California.  ***
