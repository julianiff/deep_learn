Abstract    :
              	This project supports the purchase of copies of the collected reprints of a
              special section in the Journal of Geophysical Research on the first Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment (ACE-1). The reports will be distributed to
              participants as well as science managers and science policy experts.  ACE-1 was
              a major field experiment aimed at studying the chemical, physical, and optical
              properties of atmospheric aerosol in a remote marine location. Funding for the
              U.S. component of this international experiment was primarily provided by NSF
              and NOAA. The distribution of these reprint volumes will aid in disseminating
              the results of this highly successful and relevant field campaign.
