Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will allow the Chemistry Department at Tufts University to purchase an 
              electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer.  Junior faculty Elena V.
              Rybak-Akimova will be the primary user of this instrument, which will
              facilitate her studies on transition metal coordination chemistry and the
              design of selective redox reagents and catalysts.  In addition, she will
              investigate  magnetically coupled materials; five-coordinate species with a
              vacant site at the metal ion; and molecular tweezers.  

An electron
              paramagnetic resonance spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information
              about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules.  It may also be used
              to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often
              essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
              reactions.
