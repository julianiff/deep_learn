The language of the Tamashek  people (Tuaregs of Mali, West
              Africa) will be studied in the field for the purposes of preparing a reference
              grammar in English, a Tamashek-English-French dictionary, and a collection of
              texts with facing translations and grammatical footnotes.  The result will be a
              comprehensive study of this important Berber language, accessible to and useful
              for several western and African audiences.  Of particular interest to
              linguistic theory is modeling of the complex system of grammatical derivation
              by internal changes (ablaut) within noun and verb stems.  Close study of
              Tamashek will permit clarification of the long-term influence of Tuareg on
              certain Songhay  languages to the south.
