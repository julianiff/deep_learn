	This project supports the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from the University of Chicago, studying
              the influence of international media, tourist and emigre contacts in
              contemporary Cuba.  The student will test the hypothesis that that the
              transition from rigid state control to a more open market society necessarily
              involves a cultural transformation of concepts of labor and leisure, and a more
              capitalistic relation between people and commodities.  The focus of this case
              study will be Cuba's only commercial radio station, Radio Taino.  Using methods
              of participant observation, oral histories and extensive interviews with radio
              personnel and government administrators the student will focus on the
              dissemination of a shared popular culture to create a national identity; the
              promotion of a particular form of music (salsa, once banned by the government
              and  now promoted as uniquely Cuban); and the introduction of commercial
              advertisements (banned since 1959) in radio programming.  The project will shed
              light on how the Cuban government is promoting popular music styles and
              consumer products in order to pave the way for a transformation of Cuban
              society.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social
              scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important region of the world.
