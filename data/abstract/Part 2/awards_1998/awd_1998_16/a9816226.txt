Abstract    :
              This proposed work concerns the development and maintenance of a shipboard
              acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) program on board the RVIB Nathaniel B.
              Palmer and the research vessel Laurence M. Gould, operated by the United States
              Antarctic Program.  The objective is to generate a quality-controlled data set
              on upper ocean current velocities in a sparsely sampled and remote region, yet
              one that plays an important role in the global ocean circulation.  Further
              goals are to develop the underway data collection program so that it can be
              maintained with a minimum of personnel and resources, and that the observations
              become publicly available in a timely manner.  Long-term science objectives are
              to measure the seasonal and interannual variability of upper ocean currents
              within the Drake Passage, to combine this information with similar temperature
              observations to study the variability in the heat exchange, and to characterize
              the velocity structure in the Southern Ocean on a variety of time and space
              scales.
