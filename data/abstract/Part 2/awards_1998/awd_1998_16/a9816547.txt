Abstract    :
              The particular objectives of this project are:

   To develop a finite element
              model of a Segmented Active Constrained Layer  
    treatment.  That model
              will be used as a design tool to optimize material and 
    geometrical
              parameters of a treatment for a particular structure.

   To demonstrate the
              performance of recently developed Segmented Active Constrained 
    Layer
              method on a full-size floor.

Clearly, there is a need for reliable and
              effective control technique that could adjust to varying external parameters. 
              All these requirements will be satisfied by the proposed system.  Actively
              controlled-segmented constraining layer has the capability of adjusting damper
              parameters to the external conditions at hand.  The system will be easy to
              install both in newly constructed and in existing structures.  It will also
              have a limited fail-safe capability.  The constrained viscoelastic layer will
              provide a certain level of damping even in the case of power failure.
