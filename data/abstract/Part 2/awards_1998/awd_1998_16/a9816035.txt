The pack ice region surrounding Antarctica contains at least
              fifty percent of the world's population of seals, comprising about eighty
              percent of the world's total pinniped biomass. As a group, these seals are
              among the dominant top predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and the
              fluctuation in their abundance, growth patterns, life histories, and behavior
              provide a potential source of information about environmental variability
              integrated over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This proposal was
              developed as part of the international Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) program,
              which is aimed to better understand the ecological relationships between the
              distribution of pack ice seals and their environment. During January-February,
              2000, a research cruise through the pack ice zone of the eastern Ross Sea and
              western Amundsen Sea will be conducted to survey and sample along six transects
              perpendicular to the continental shelf. Each of these transects will pass
              through five environmental sampling strata:  continental shelf zone, Antarctic
              slope front, pelagic zone, the ice edge front, and the open water outside the
              pack ice zone. All zones but open water will be ice-covered to some degree. The
              objective of this component of the APIS program is to evaluate the health,
              disease exposure and pathology of Antarctic pack ice seals encountered during
              the cruise. The impact of disease and pathology on population dynamics will be
              investigated. The importance of base line information on the incidence of
              disease organisms and pathology is critical, particularly for Antarctic seals
              due to the scarce clinical data available from animals in situ. Better insight
              into the interplay among pack ice seals and biological and physical features of
              Antarctic marine ecosystems will allow for a better prediction of fluctuation
              in seal population in the context of environmental change.
