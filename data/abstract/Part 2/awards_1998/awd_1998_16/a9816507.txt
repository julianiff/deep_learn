Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF)/Junior Faculty Program will allow the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of North Dakota to purchase a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer. 
              This instrument will be used primarily by Mahesh Lakshman, a junior faculty
              member, for his research program involving the synthesis and study of
              chiroptical properties of glycosides; and chemical synthesis for the study of
              carcinogen-DNA interactions.  The department also plans to incorporate CD
              spectrometry into the advanced organic and physical chemistry laboratory
              courses.  

Measurements of optical activity have long played an essential
              role in the development of organic chemistry and biochemistry.  The study of
              circular dichroism provides important information about the electronic states
              or structures of individual molecules or ions.  These techniques are used when
              studying absolute configurations of molecules, reaction mechanisms and
              kinetics, asymmetric or stereospecific syntheses, thermodynamic properties of
              dissolved species, and many other stereochemical problems.
