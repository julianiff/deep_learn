Abstract    :
                 Taste is a chemical sense, but we know far less about the  cellular
              mechanisms of taste reception than about smell.   There  have been remarkable
              recent discoveries about olfactory receptor  molecules in the nose, but no
              comparable breakthrough in taste.  This project is a Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research to try to  establish whether molecular correlates for
              gustatory receptor  molecules in taste buds in the human tongue can be
              identified.  Molecular biological techniques will be used on isolated taste 
              buds to determine if certain DNA is found only in taste receptor  cells,
              implying a specific role for certain genes in expressing  proteins involved in
              taste.  This is a high-impact/high-risk  project because the outcome is not at
              all clear, but the potential  impact of success is wide-ranging.      Results
              will be fundamental to a substantial advance in  understanding cellular
              mechanisms of taste, and could have an  immediate impact on applications in the
              food industry.
