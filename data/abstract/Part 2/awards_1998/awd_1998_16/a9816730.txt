Abstract    :
              Dr. Pamela Shapiro, Department of Chemistry, University of Idaho, is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division to (i) explore the chemistry and possible catalytic
              applications of new (bent) ansa-chromocene systems to polymerization processes,
              (ii) modify the ansa-metallocene ligand framework to potentially improve the
              catalytic properties, and (iii) examine the behavior of these systems under
              high hydrogen, ethylene, carbon monoxide (and others) gas pressures. The latter
              objective will involve a collaboration with scientists at the Pacific Northwest
              National Laboratories (PNNL).

Two benefits will accrue from this NSF
              support: (1) development and characterization of new, potentially useful
              ansa-metallocene homogeneous catalysts to improve certain polymerization
              processes, and (2) expose graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral
              associates of the University of Idaho to cutting-edge technology and learn
              state-of-the-art techniques through a collaborative partnership with the
              scientific staff of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories.
