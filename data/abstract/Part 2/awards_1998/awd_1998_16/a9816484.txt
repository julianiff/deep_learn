Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary award to Jay A. Switzer at the University of
              Missouri-Rolla is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry
              Division and the Solid-state Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials
              Research. The focus of the research is the electrodeposition of  layered
              nanostructures and superlattices with quantum-confined optical and electrical
              properties from aqueous solution under conditions of oscillating electrode
              potential at constant current. Highly anisotropic copper/cuprous oxide
              multilayers will be electrodeposited from alkaline copper lactate solution. The
              dependence of oscillation period, amplitude, wave shape, composition and layer
              thickness will be studied as a function of pH, concentration, current density,
              temperature, irradiation intensity and deposition substrate.  The multilayers
              will be characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy,
              scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The
              deposition process will be followed in real time by use of the electrochemical
              quartz crystal microbalance.  The dependence of the optical properties on the
              cuprous oxide layer thickness will be studied by transmission and specular
              reflectance  spectroscopy.

Copper oxide films show blue-shifting consistent
              with  quantum confinement and negative differential resistance characteristic
              of resonant tunneling. Tunneling devices will become increasingly important  as
              dimensions shrink in computers and other electronic devices.
