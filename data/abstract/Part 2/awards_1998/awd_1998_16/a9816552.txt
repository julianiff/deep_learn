Abstract    :
              Zink is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his
              studies of excited electronic states and reactivity of inorganic molecular
              precursors for photodeposition of metals and semiconductors. The project has
              three complementary objectives: to characterize spectroscopically the excited
              electronic states of metal containing compounds, to study their single and
              multiphoton photochemistry and correlate it with the spectroscopy, and to make
              nanostructures of metals and semiconductors by photochemical reactions of these
              compounds.  Outcomes from this project will be a thorough spectroscopic
              understanding of the excited electronic states of these inorganic compounds,
              interpretation of the photochemical reactions from these states, and insights
              into the photochemical conditions necessary to deposit nanostructured materials
              controllably. 

Thin film materials have important technological
              applications, and improvements in the fabrication of multilayer structures with
              well-defined physical properties are sought to increase the capabilities of
              semiconductor manufacturing.  Real-time chemical information about activated
              gas phase species involved in materials growth on surfaces will enhance the
              understanding of chemical vapor deposition used for industrial processing.
