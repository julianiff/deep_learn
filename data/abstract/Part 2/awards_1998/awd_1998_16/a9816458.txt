Abstract    :
              How do people learn, revise, and reason about everyday biological,
physics,
              artifact, and social categories?  The presence and structure of
causal
              knowledge about the interrelations among the properties associated
with novel,
              but plausible everyday categories will be studied in five
              behavioral
experiments.  At the same time, in a factorial design, the
              statistical
structure of the properties associated with members of the
              categories will
be manipulated.  The experimental manipulations vary the
              presence and
structure of this background information: participants will be
              tutored on
information organized into "common-cause," "common effect,"
              "linear
chain," or "no inter-relationship" schemas.  Then the effects of
              this
recently learned background information on learning,
              classification,
inductive inferences and similarity judgments will be
              measured.  The
impact of information that disconfirms prior knowledge of these
              concepts
will also be studied, as a function of the participant's beliefs
              about
causal structure of the categories. The results will advance
              our
theoretical and practical knowledge about category representation
              and
category-based reasoning.  The research addresses many philosophical
              and
psychological questions about everyday knowledge and reasoning. 
              The
results are directly relevant to science education:  How do we
              learn
general, background scientific information and then relate that
              knowledge
to specific scientific concepts.
