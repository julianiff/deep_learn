Abstract    :
              The National Research Council, through its Commission on Engineering and
              Technical Systems, has established the Board on Infrastructure and the
              Constructed Environment (BICE).  The BICE was established in 1994 to
              investigate questions of technology, science, and public policy applied to
              urban systems and services; above ground and underground construction; the
              relationship between the constructed and natural environments and their
              interaction with human activities; the effects of natural hazards on
              constructed facilities; and related issues of planning, design, construction,
              management, surety, and use of the built environment.    The BICE brings
              together in an independent forum expertise from a wide range of scientific,
              engineering, and social science disciplines to address problems and issues of
              infrastructure and the build environment.  The BICE provides a unique structure
              to respond to specific requests from government, or to act on its own
              initiative with public or private sector support.  In pursuit of its goals,
              BICE plans to conduct on-going strategic planning for studies, workshops,
              symposia, and a variety of information dissemination activities.  The BICE will
              also develop integrated and coordinated activities with the Institute for Civil
              Infrastructure (ICIS), established by NSF at the Wagner Graduate School at New
              York University.
