Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Ervin will investigate the interactions between gas-phase
              transition metal clusters and adsorbates.  Energy-resolved collision-induced
              dissociation and time-resolved photodissociation experiments are used to
              measure the binding energies of adsorbates on the clusters.  Statistical rate
              theory is applied to the cluster dissociation data to obtain desorption
              energies.  Major thrusts include exploitation of photodissociation dynamics
              techniques to obtain binding energies of bare metal clusters and of adsorbates
              on clusters; exploration of gas-phase transition metal clusters as actual
              catalysts; and examination of small cluster/ligand systems of relevance to
              catalysis.  A guide ion beam tandem mass spectrometer will be used to gather
              the data.

The data measured in this project are important for determining
              catalytic reaction mechanisms and for mapping out reaction paths.  The clusters
              under study here are models for catalytic systems because they mimic small
              metal crystallites that comprise the reaction centers in catalysts used in
              industrial processes.  Gas phase clusters themselves can also act as catalysts,
              as in the oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide by platinum cluster
              anions.
