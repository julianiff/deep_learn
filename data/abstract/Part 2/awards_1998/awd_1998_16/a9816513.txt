Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Chemistry Department at the University of Chicago to
              purchase a combination fluorescence and Brewster angle microscope/Langmuir
              trough instrument.  This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty
              member Ka Yee C. Lee, whose research focuses on the study of lipid-protein
              interactions at interfaces; interactions between proteins and lung
              surfactant-specific lipids; and the role of membrane lipids in the aggregation
              of amyloid beta peptides.  

Dr. Lee's research, which involves surface
              chemical investigations of the interactions of surface-active peptides with
              lipid monolayers at the air-water interface, has considerable practical merit
              as well as fundamental significance.  The applications are sure to yield
              interesting new knowledge regarding important biological systems.   In
              addition, it is quite likely that the results will be highly relevant to lung
              diseases involving premature infants and emphysema; thus, there should be a
              significant beneficial effect on society at large.
