              Abstract  ATM-9816317  Mock, Carey  University of Oregon  Title: Late Quaternary
              Climate of Northeast Asia: Temporal and  Spatial Variability    This award
              supports a project designed to improve the understanding  of late Quaternary
              climatic systems of the subarctic by documenting  spatial and temporal
              variations in climates of the last 18,000  radiocarbon years for NE Asia,
              describing millennial and centennial  scale mechanisms that can account for the
              observed paleoclimatic  changes, and comparing results from NE Asia to other
              regions (e.g.,  SE Asia, NW North America, North Atlantic) to obtain a more 
              holistic view of the inter-relationships of regional climatic  systems. 
              Overall research goals will be accomplished by: 1)  reconstructing past
              climates through the collection and analysis of  modern and ancient botanical,
              geochemical, and diatom data  preserved in lake sediments; 2) developing high
              quality  chronologies using improved radiocarbon techniques; 3) examining 
              modern synoptic climatic patterns and general circulation model  simulations
              identify possible causes of climatic change; 4)  comparing the proxy- and
              model-based paleoclimatic interpretations  to assess the most likely mechanisms
              behind the observed climatic  histories; and 5) exploring possible hemispheric
              scale linkages  associated with Milankovitch and sub-Milankovitch scale event.
