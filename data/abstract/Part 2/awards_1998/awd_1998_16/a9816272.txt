This dissertation research project supports a
              cultural anthropology student from Pennsylvania State University studying the
              social networks and patterns of support that low income African American men
              provide to their children.  The questions to be studied involve the variation
              among low income African American men in the amount, kind and frequency of
              resource transfers to children; whether this variability is related to formal
              features of their social networks, specifically the density, size and strength
              of ties; and how the attributes such as age, socioeconomic status, gender and
              kinship relation of network members influence contributions of these men to the
              support of their children.  Methods include a snowball sample of men with
              open-ended and structured interviews, participant observation, and a survey of
              307 men.  The hypotheses to be tested, among others, are that younger unwed
              fathers will have denser, more closed networks than older men whose networks
              will contain many valuable "weak ties"; and that the support will often flow
              indirectly through intergenerational care-giving networks.
This research is
              important because it will provide a better understanding of familial roles
              assumed by these men, and will analyze the actual levels of support provided by
              these fathers, directly and indirectly, to their children.  This in-depth
              ethnographic information will reveal the extant behavior to correct the
              misinformation produced by census surveys, which have tended to underreport the
              activity of unmarried fathers.
