Abstract    :
              The Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center collects, maintains, and distributes
              genetic stocks of the fly Drosophila melanogaster.  The sophisticated genetic
              tools developed in Drosophila over the past 85 years make this insect a
              powerful model organism for biological research.  The collection currently
              consists of over 6,400 different genetic stocks including visible, lethal and
              sterile mutations (34% of the collection), chromosome aberrations (30%), marked
              transposon insertions (30% of holdings), and special-purpose stocks (6%).  An
              electronic database allowing users full access to up-to-date information about
              stocks available from the collection.  In addition, Center scientists are
              available to answer questions and provide advice on the use of these materials.
               The Center is heavily used, with 38,147 subcultures provided during 1997. 
              Academia-based research received 98% of the stocks provided in 1997, 63% of
              these within the U.S. and the remaining 37% spread among 35 countries.  This
              resources contributes to scientific progress primarily by assuring that a wide
              variety of documented strains of current researchers of the burden of providing
              large numbers of stocks to colleagues), and by promoting the effective use of
              available research materials through information services.
