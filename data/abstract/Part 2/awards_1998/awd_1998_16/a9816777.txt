Title:  Temporal Pattern Learning 


The purpose of the
              proposed research is to determine conditions that facilitate anticipatory
              tracking, and to develop a quantitative theory of temporal pattern learning.
              The data will come from rats in lever boxes.  Food will be available at a
              repeating sequence of  2 - 10 intervals in which it will be delivered following
              the first lever response after a particular time interval (from 1 and 512
              seconds). The research will determine how the characteristics of a series of
              time intervals influence the ability of rats to anticipate the time when food
              will next be available.

Most learning of animals has been assumed to be
              based on recent experience, or a long-term average of experience.  But with a
              repeating series of temporal intervals, rats learn to respond at a time
              appropriate for the next interval in the series, in anticipation of a reward. 
              Two types of explanations have been proposed for anticipatory tracking: rule
              learning and associative learning theory.  A quantitative associative learning
              theory may explain the results, even from conditions designed to support rule
              learning. This would provide an explanation of how animals are able to plan a
              sequence of behavior.
