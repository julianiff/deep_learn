Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is to determine the contribution of the oxidation of
              sulfur in sea salt aerosols to the atmospheric sulfur budget in the remote
              marine boundary layer. In order to distinguish this process from cloud
              processing, aerosol samples will be collected at Baring Head, New Zealand - a
              site where persistent cloud-free conditions are frequently observed. Bulk
              aerosol ion composition as well as individual particle elemental measurements
              will be performed. A technique will be developed to determine the
              size-dependent buffering capacity of ambient sea salt aerosols. It is
              hypothesized that this buffering capacity is higher than that of bulk seawater
              because of the presence of biogenic calcium carbonate in the surface
              microlayer. A higher buffering capacity would affect the highly pH-dependent
              oxidation of sulfur dioxide by ozone, leading to increased oxidation.
