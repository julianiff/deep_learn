Abstract    :
              9816809  According to a 1996 NRC report, fewer than 25% of teachers in grades
              5-8 majored in science, and less than 45% completed more than 10 credit hours
              of college science.  The goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of
              science teaching in grades 6-12.  Improving science teaching requires a
              complete overhaul of the traditional science-teaching models, however
              in-service teachers have few opportunities to see alternate techniques modeled.
               The PI proposes to develop a pilot short course that will help in-service
              science teachers incorporate inquiry-based and research-based education into
              their teaching techniques.  During this short course, the teachers will do
              their own geoscience research on a local watershed and develop instructional
              plans to take their research activities into their classroom.  The course is
              based on a similar course that was developed for instruction of undergraduates
              and graduate students.  Although this course will be based on the local
              watershed, the result will be a model workshop that could be adapted for any
              location.  This award is collaborative with proposal # 98-09826 by Dr. Barbara
              Cooper.
