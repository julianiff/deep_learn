Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate gravity wave induced fluctuations in mesosphere/lower
              thermosphere (MLT) airglow emissions.  The investigation will utilize a
              two-dimensional, fully non-linear model describing the variation of minor
              species densities in the MLT with dynamical (wave) transport and diffusion
              processes, coupled with a fully mature full-wave model for realistic simulation
              of gravity waves' propagation.  This research addresses fundamental science
              issues of the mesosphere's energetics and chemistry.  It enhances understanding
              of observed airglow variations, and facilitates the interpretation of these
              observations.
