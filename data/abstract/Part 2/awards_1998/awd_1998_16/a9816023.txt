Abstract    :
              This proposal is for support of a multifaceted and comprehensive center for
              research in systemic reform.  The proposal identifies four goals, namely: a) to
              build capacity and leadership in the domain of system reform research; b) to
              stimulate other researchers to engage in educational system change theory-based
              inquiry; c) to increase the base of usable knowledge on effective system
              practice; and d) to design and field test technological and curricular
              enablements to high-quality learning of mathematics and science for all
              students.  

This proposal will address the four goals above, in part by
              establishing national research clusters in various domains of system change
              (such as complexity and systems as learning organizations).
