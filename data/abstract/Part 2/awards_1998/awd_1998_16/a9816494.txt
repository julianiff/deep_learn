ABSTRACT 
CTS-9816494
H. Monbouquette/UCLA

This project would establish
              the feasibility of an entirely new approach for creating nanometer-scale,
              patterned surfaces.  A wide variety of chemically heterogeneous surfaces could
              be created with applications ranging from sensing to quantum electronics.  The
              basic idea involves the use of semiconductor nanoparticles to create patterns
              on self- assembled organic monolayers.  A virtually unlimited variety of
              chemically functionalized surfaces with characteristic dimension similar to
              that of the nanoparticles could be built up from theses patterned surfaces
