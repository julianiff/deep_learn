Abstract    :
              The deer mouse (Peronysucs maniculatus) and congeneric species are the most
              common native North American mammals.  They range from Alaska to Central
              America and occur in many natural habitats.  Because of their abundance, these
              mice constitute a major component of nearctic terrestrial ecosystems. 
              Laboratory stocks of both wild-type and genetically variant Peromyscus are used
              for investigations in which laboratory-based studies can be interfaced with
              those of natural populations.  The Peronysucs Genetic Stock Center was
              established in 1985 to provide a reliable source of these animals and related
              materials to the national scientific and educational communities.  The Center
              currently keeps seven species of Peromyscus and more than 35 distinctive mutant
              and other genetically defined stocks primarily of the deer mouse.  The Stock
              Center also supplies biological materials form Peronmyscus including fresh,
              frozen and preserved tissues, and molecular probes and libraries.  The Stock
              Center functions as a clearing house for information regarding this genus by
              sponsoring an internet database, maintaining a reference collection of
              reprints, standardizing the genetic nomenclature for the genus and publishing a
              semi-annual Peronmyscus Newsletter.  These resources are widely used in the
              U.S. and elsewhere.  Continued partial support by NSF for this project is
              requested.
