Abstract    :
              This conference will explore the mechanisms and control of various types of
              cellular proteolysis.  The conference will be held May 5-9, 1999, at the Cold
              Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Eight scientific sessions are planned around basic
              cell processes in which proteolysis plays an important role.  The sessions are
              (1) Signal transduction, (2) Protease complexes and cascades, (3) Development,
              (4) Cell cycle, (5) Chaperones and protein quality control, (6) Infectious
              diseases and host-pathogen interactions, (7) Neoplasia, and (8) Cell death.  An
              overall aim of the program is to facilitate cross-talk between the cell
              biologists who study these processes and the biochemists and molecular
              biologists who focus on individual components of the proteolytic processing
              pathways.  A total of 250 scientists are expected to attend.  A portion of the
              invited speakers will be chosen from the abstracts submitted by applicants. 
              Co-chairs of sessions will be senior scientists who will be expected to present
              overviews for each of the topics.  All participants will have the opportunity
              to present posters.  The organizers expect that over half of the participants
              will be graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
