     The investigator and his colleagues conduct an
              experimental
interdisciplinary training course at Marine
              Biological
Laboratory, Woods Hole, on modeling of biological systems. 
              The
course lasts for six weeks and aims to rapidly introduce
students,
              postdocs, and more senior investigators to a range of
biology, mathematics,
              and computation.  The goal is to bring them
quickly to the point where they
              can begin effective
collaborations with investigators of complementary
              expertise on
biology problems of mutual interest.  Innovative aspects of
              the
project include its immersion in the subjects, thematic
organization,
              modularity of content, interdisciplinary teaming
during the course, and
              planned multi-year involvement of
participants, including students.
     The
              richness of biology and the deeper understanding offered
by mathematical
              analyses and modeling require concerted nurturing
to foster the continuation
              and growth of collaborations at this
interface.  The investigator and his
              colleagues organize an
intense interdisciplinary course on modeling of
              biological
systems, aimed to provide the necessary common background
              for
students and researchers in biology, mathematical sciences,
              and
engineering.  The goals of the course include: (a) training
biologists in
              the use of fundamental and sophisticated modeling
oaradigms and tools, (b)
              training mathematical scientists in a
biological arena, including laboratory
              experience, (c) bringing
computational and experimental biologists together in
              considering
certain specific research areas, (d) establishing a
              common
framework for addressing quantitative analysis and understanding
of
              biological systems, (e) serving as an interdisciplinary
training and resource
              venue for addressing questions of modeling
of biological systems.  In
              addressing these goals, the course
fosters the development of the shared
              language and skills
necessary for scientists, mathematicians, and engineers
              to
collaborate in solving key problems.
