This project involves a workshop organized by the
              Earthquake Information Providers Group (EqIP) that will be held in Buffalo, New
              York in October, 1998.  The agenda will include plenary sessions on topics
              designed to foster collaboration and sharing of information in the earthquake
              hazard mitigation field.  State-of-the-art technical information that will
              encourage innovative cooperative projects of the group, an inclusive entity
              that was established with NSF support a few years ago, will be provided. 
              Selected users will be invited  to describe their information needs and assess
              those services currently provided to them.  A session will be devoted to an
              update from the group's webmaster, who will also solicit ways that the EQNET
              web page can enhance dissemination and coordination of  services and products
              in the field.
