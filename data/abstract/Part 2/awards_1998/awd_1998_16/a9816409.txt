Abstract    :
              9816409  Nealson    For most of the history of the Earth, the biosphere was
              dominated by simpler organisms, such as algal mats that exist today in Baja
              California.  A fundamental question is how did this primitive biosphere impact
              the global chemical and physical environment of the planet?  The answer to this
              question is important not only for the past history of Earth, but for other
              planets in the solar system and extra-solar planets.  Recent progress in
              modeling of planetary atmospheres suggests that an essentially correct
              understanding of the atmospheric radiative and chemical environment can be
              attained once the chemical forcing is prescribed.  This research effort is a
              first step in answering these questions by focusing on the interaction between
              a simple biosphere and the atmospheres of Earth and Mars.  Drs. Kenneth Nealson
              and Yuk Yung will  (1) monitor gas fluxes over the surfaces of algal mats; (2)
              monitor gas concentrations as a function of depth in the mats; (3) perform
              molecular analyses of the mat populations as a function of depth in order to
              define the major phylogenetic groups present in the stratified mat communities;
              and (4) model the  impact of gas emissions on the atmosphere. Funding for this
              project is shared between the Division of Astronomical Sciences  and the Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorate.
