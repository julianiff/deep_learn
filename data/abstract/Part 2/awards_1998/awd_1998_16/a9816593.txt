Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS 9816593    Principal Investigator:  M. P.
              Menguc      The PI proposes to study the fundamental issues associated with a
              "laser scalpel."  The project will involve a collaborative
              experimental/theoretical/ practicum effort between the PI at the Department of
              Mechanical Engineering and faculty of the Department of Laser Surgery at the
              University of Kentucky and the faculty of the Shriner's Research Center at the
              Massachusetts General Hospital.  Experiments and theoretical studies will be
              conducted using numerical/analytical models of radiation transfer and laser
              propagation in tissue to study the effects of wavelength, pulse frequency,
              energy, and directionality.  The goal is to create an interdisciplinary
              learning, documenting, and teaching approach which will ultimately lead to the
              seamless use of a smart laser scalpel.
