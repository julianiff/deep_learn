Stirred tanks (mixing vessels)
              represent a ubiquitous element in the chemical process industry.  The complex
              flows created in these vessels renders their analysis and design enhancements a
              quite difficult task.  This award will focus on the quantitative/visualization
              expertise of the PI on the task of identifying and improving these complex flow
              fields.  It is expected that pollution prevention and enhanced competitiveness
              will derive from these efforts.
