Title: Factors affecting performance in foraging

This
              project assesses the role of differential foraging experience in determining an
              individual's lifetime production of successful offspring. Previous work has
              shown that individuals vary greatly in their ability to choose hunting sites
              that provide access to the most prey.  The juvenile stage is a major source of
              experience potentially affecting the foraging efforts of the all-important
              adult reproductive stage.  This work examines the periods following emergence
              from the nest sac and preceding pre-adult molt, using the crab spider Misumena
              vatia, a sit-and-wait predator that hunts for insects on flowers.  Spiders of
              known foraging history will be exposed to various hunting sites (different
              species of flowers, etc.), and then tested on thus-familiar and novel
              substrates to evaluate the carryover of such experience.  Laboratory and field
              experiments are incorporated into the research.

The work is important in
              commencing to dissect the factors responsible for differential success among
              individuals, focusing on a factor likely to be of greatest importance in
              establishing what traits are maintained in a population, thereby driving the
              evolution of behavior.  The behavior adopted may determine how effectively a
              species can exploit available resources, in turn affecting the characteristics
              of coexisting species, as well as the biodiversity of biological communities.
