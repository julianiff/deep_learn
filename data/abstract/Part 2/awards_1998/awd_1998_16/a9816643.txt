Abstract    :
              This project by Professor Eric Grimsrud of Montana State University is a study
              of the elementary steps of resonant electron capture reactions that occur in
              the gas phase.  These reactions underlie the transduction response of electron
              capture detectors used in gas chromatography, ionization sources in ion
              mobility spectrometry, and several forms of negative ion mass spectrometry. 
              Better understanding of these reaction steps leads to both better
              reproducibility of measurement, and then better quantitative measurements using
              transducers that involve these elementary steps.  Mechanistic understanding may
              also lead to methods that can be used to decrease the rate of thermal
              detachment reactions, leading to applications of the transducers for the
              detections of compounds of low or moderate electron affinity.

This proposal
              addresses the elementary steps that affect the response of a widely-used
              detector in gas chromatography, and a widely used ionization source in mass
              spectrometry.  Better understanding of those steps will lead to more precise
              and accurate analytical measurements, most especially in methods used in
              environmental analysis.
