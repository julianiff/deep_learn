Abstract    :
              Failure in requirements analysis is increasingly seen as a key problem in system
              design.  Low-level requirements arising out of established and stable
              organizational workflow patterns are relatively easy to comprehend, but it is
              harder to determine high-level requirements arising from the broader
              institutional and organizational contexts of workflow that determine what
              ultimately can and cannot be accomplished with computer-based information
              systems. Environments with broad degrees of freedom for organizational action,
              especially when systems are intended to change organizational behavior present
              designers with the need to reduce the search space to viable options.  The
              process for determining high-level requirements through a strategy of
              search-space definition and reduction is developed using  an enhanced version
              of the  Grossman, Hart and Moore property rights model to create an a priori
              alignment model of task responsibilities and asset ownership in a complex
              production system dependent on non-integrated coordination mechanisms such as
              contracts.  This is used to determine a limited but realistic set of workflow
              parameters that frame the requirements analysis task.  The test domain is the
              development of information system support for process coordination in advanced
              logistics, but the results of the work will be  generalizable to a wider range
              of organizational problems. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~king/hlr.html
