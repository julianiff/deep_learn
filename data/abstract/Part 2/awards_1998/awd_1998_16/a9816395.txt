     This grant provides funding for the workshop on Supply Chain
              Management in Electronic Commerce which will be held in Gainesville, Florida
              from October 19-21, 1998. The purpose of the workshop is to identify
              opportunities for improving supply chain performance in the presence of new
              Internet technologies and to set an agenda for future academic research. The
              focused areas include:  (1) supply chain management in Electronic Commerce, (2)
              coordination of replenishment, production, inventory, pricing, and quality
              along supply chains, and (3) modeling and analysis of supply chain operations
              in the information age. 
     The workshop will bring together leading
              industry practitioners and academic researchers to discuss issues in supply
              chain management. The important objectives include:  (1) establish the dialogue
              between industry and academia on the subject, (2) identify important issues in
              the area, (3) collect industry inputs on future academic research directions,
              and (4) set an agenda for future academic research on high impact topics.  The
              success of the workshop will lead to a better understanding of the challenges
              of supply chain operations in the information age. It will help foster industry
              and academic collaboration. The identification of high impact topics will guide
              future academic research.
