Abstract    :
              Questions about what happens to a solution to a problem of 
optimization when
              the parameters on which the problem depends 
are perturbed are important not
              only in assessing the stability 
of mathematical models, but also in the
              design and justification 
of computational procedures.  Issues of parametric
              dependence 
are also the key to effective utilization of `cost-to-go'
              functions 
in dynamical optimization, whether in optimal control or stochastic
              
programming.  This project would advance the methodology for dealing 
with
              such dependence and explore its consequences for computation.

The latest
              tools in variational analysis, which are essential because
of inherent
              nonsmoothness in parametric dependence, would be applied.
Alternative forms of
              optimality conditions, focused especially on 
perturbational robustness, would
              be investigated in a broad framework,
both finite- and infinite-dimensional. 
              Cost-to-go functions in convex
dynamical optimization would be studied from
              the new perspective both 
in deterministic continuous-time models, with their
              connections to 
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and in stochastic discrete-time
              models, where
the numerical potential will dominate.
