Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803896  Fredericka A. Kaestle    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled Y
              chromosome  and mitochondrial DNA variation in the Pacific: evidence for 
              prehistoric population movements. Y-chromosome and  mitochondrial DNA markers
              are being examined from  individuals from New Guinea and Australia to
              investigate  maternal and paternal patterns of gene flow with regards to  the
              peopling of the Pacific. Estimates are being made of  the timing and nature of
              these  diasporas and the relationship of  these peoples to other worldwide 
              populations.
