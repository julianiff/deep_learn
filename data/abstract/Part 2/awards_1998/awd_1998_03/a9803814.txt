Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Archaeology of a Late Prehistoric Ethnic Frontier, Naknek River,
              Alaska    This project examines the territorial limit of late prehistoric
              people of Alutiiq (southernmost Eskimo) speech along the lower Naknek River in
              southwestern Alaska, specifically at a point on or near the frontier of
              encounter with another group of people at the end of the eighteenth century. 
              The territory of this Alutiiq people (dating from about A.D. 1450 to 1800) is
              expected to be marked by a distinctive house form, common elsewhere only on the
              Kodiak Island group, and by particular artifacts.  Excavations at a relatively
              undisturbed site on the lower river will help to shed light on the late
              prehistoric territorial limits and the length of time that two separate
              communities coexisted in the region.
