Abstract    :
              Abstract  Savin  DMS-9803806    Muic will investigate unitary representations of
              classical and certain exceptional reductive p-adic Lie groups, with emphasis on
              applications in number theory.  This will include investigations of
              reducibility of induced representations and complementary series.  He will also
              investigate a construction of isolated unitary representations.    The theory
              of Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one
              of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical
              vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the theory of
              unitary representations of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
              mathematics itself, for example in number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
              especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
