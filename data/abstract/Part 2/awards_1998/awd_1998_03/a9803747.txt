Khoshnevisan

This grant provides funds for Davar Khoshnevisan and
              Yimin Xiao at the University of Utah to develop a systematic approach to the
              study of many of the exceptional sets which naturally arise in the study of
              random fields.  Special emphasis will be placed on Gaussian random fields such
              as the Brownian sheet and fractional Brownian motion.  More specifically, these
              investigators will (1) study precise quantitative connections between random
              fields, capacities and higher--order partial differential equations; (2)
              develop and advance canonical techniques for the multi-fractal and geometric
              analysis of a large class of Gaussian random fields; (3) continue their
              on-going work on developing connections between the theory of Gaussian
              processes and capacity in Wiener space; and (4) continue their investigation of
              canonical heat flow on a class of random erratic surfaces and
              structures.

This research will study the properties of Gaussian random
              fields, such as the Brownian sheet and fractional Brownian motion.  These are
              random fields which play a prominent role in several disciplines in mathematics
              and mathematical aspects of economics, oceanography, hydrology and physics. 
              The goal of the proposed research is to develop analytical tools which will
              lead to a better understanding of geometric problems for random fields and help
              promote their further applicability.
