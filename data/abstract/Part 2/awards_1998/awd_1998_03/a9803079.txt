Abstract    :
                Biomechanical hypotheses have been developed to suggest that both body size
              and body proportions should cause predictable changes in the locomotion of
              quadrupedal animals. These suggestions have been used to reconstruct locomotor
              modes of fossil primates. However, these hypotheses have not been adequately
              tested experimentally. Using a high-speed 3D motion analysis system in
              conjuction with a force platform, this study will quantify the locomotor
              patterns and mechanics of a closely related group of  Old World monkeys that
              habitually move quadrupedally on the ground (vervets, patas monkeys, baboons,
              pig-tailed macaques).   The primary goal is to measure the effects of both body
              size and body proportions on locomotor performance variables. Three different
              types of comparisons will be made:  intraspecific comparisons between males and
              females of each species since they differ in body size but have similar body
              proportions; narrow interspecific comparisons between individuals that have
              similar body mass, but differ in body proportions; and broad interspecific
              comparisons across the entire sample. These data will be useful for evaluating
              the mechanical hypotheses that relate body size and body proportions to
              locomotion. In addition, experimentally established relationships between
              locomotor behavior and morphology will increase the level of confidence that is
              placed in the functional interpretations of the locomotor morphology of fossil
              primates.
