Sliced inverse regression (SIR) and principal Hessian
              directions (PHD) are two newly established dimension reduction techniques. 
              Their properties have been studied under general regression settings.  This
              research involves the application of these methods to several problems arising
              from the following areas:

(1) Monte Carlo and Bayesian computation,
(2)
              nonlinear time series,
(3) semiparametric modeling,
(4) multivariate outcome
              and functional data analysis, and
(5) uncertainty  analysis of
              mathematical/physical/computer models.

These settings are more complicated. 
              In (1), importance sampling and rejection sampling are considered.  The
              importance weights can be treated as the outcome values.  The goal becomes the
              study of finding a simplified  relationship between the weights and the sampled
              points.  Dimension reduction can help find the modes of posterior
              distributions.  Proper formulation of the problem is also needed in (2)-(4)
              before applying SIR/PHD.

Dimensionality is an issue that can arise in every
              scientific field.  Generally speaking, the difficulty lies on how to visualize
              a data set involving several variables or the shape of a function with several
              arguments. SIR/PHD are domain-free dimension reduction tools that can be
              conveniently applied in areas where mining data for information is crucial. 
              For this research, the primary examples include ground water modeling,
              recovering signals from convoluted data sequences in digital communication, and
              analyzing  nonlinear economic time series data.
