PROJECT
              SUMMARY

This proposal outlines a mathematical investigation of a class of
              free
boundary problems for slow viscous (Stokes) fluid regions in both
              two
and three dimensions. The proposal is motivated by recent results on
              a
remarkable mathematical structure underlying a fundamental problem in
the
              study of two-dimensional Stokes flow.  Crowdy and Tanveer have
devised a new
              global theoretical approach to the problem of 2D Stokes
flow which resulted in
              the identification of an infinity of conserved
quantities associated with a
              large class of exact solutions for a
simply-connected fluid region, and the
              discovery of the first-known
exact solutions for doubly-connected fluid
              regions.  These significant
mathematical results will be developed in various
              directions.  Of
primary interest is the important and highly non-trivial
              question of
generalization to three-dimensional Stokes flow.  Preliminary
              numerical
studies by Nie and Tanveer have shown that axisymmetric (3D)
              Stokes
bubble exhibits very similar qualitative behavior to
              its
two-dimensional analogue (e.g. formation of near-cusps and
              topological
changes).  The results on two-dimensional Stokes flow will
              be
generalized in various directions.  Exact solutions in regions
              of
connectivity greater than two is of great interest.  Moreover,
additional
              physical factors will be studied including electrostatic
(electric fields) and
              thermo-capillary effects.


The mathematical problems to be studied are of
              great physical interest
and application. The solutions serve as useful models
              in the physical
process of viscous sintering. Sintering is a term broadly
              referring to
the consolidation of an assemblage of particles in which the
              mass
transport is driven by surface tension and there exists a
              huge
literature on the subject spanning many disciplines from
              materials
science to environmental engineering.  Understanding such
              sintering
processes is very important, for example, in fiber-optic
              and
opto-electronic technologies.  The study of the boundary evolution
              of
small blobs of viscous fluid in the presence of an electric field
              is
crucial for the understanding of ink-jet printing technologies.
              The
project also has potential biotechnological relevance -- cells
structures
              and membranes are often modelled as (charged) blobs of very
viscous fluid kept
              together by surface tension forces on the boundary.
This project will provide
              an understanding of the mathematics
underlying these important physical
              models.
