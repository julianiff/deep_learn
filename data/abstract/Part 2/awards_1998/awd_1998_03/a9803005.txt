Abstract    :
              9803005  Ren    This grant supports research at a predominantly  undergraduate
              institution to  study aspects of phonon  excitations in quantum dots.  The work
              focuses on  consequences of the reduced dimensionality of the dot,  including
              interface and edge modes and mode mixing resulting  from confinement. The PI
              will use a microscopic model to  calculate realistic phonon modes in quantum
              dots and to  investigate the effect of electron-phonon coupling on  carrier
              relaxation and optical properties.  %%%  Ren will carry out theoretical
              research at a predominantly  undergraduate institution that seeks to describe
              the atomic  vibrations of atomic-scale structures consisting of a  relatively
              small number of atoms known as `quantum dots.'  Quantum dots are potentially
              useful in developing atomic-  scale electronic and optical devices.  ***
