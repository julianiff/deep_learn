This research is focused on reference Bayesian
              methods (Bayesian inference with prior distributions chosen by some formal
              rule), mixture models, Bayes factors, and causal inference, with an emphasis on
              hierarchical models (including classical mixed models and their
              generalizations).  Both parametric and nonparametric or semiparametric models
              are studied.  Many of the results are obtained by asymptotic methods, but
              ``exact'' computation (typically via simulation) also play a substantial
              role.

Elaboration of simple statistical models has been a major theme in the
              discipline in the latter part of this century.  Previously, models have
              involved a small number of parameters, the values of which have been determined
              from observed data.  With increased computing power, more complicated
              statistical models involving many more parameters have become central to much
              current statistical activity.  Yet, despite recent progress, fundamental issues
              remain.  This research is motivated in part by problems in statistical
              genetics, cognitive neuroscience, and the study of criminal behavior.
