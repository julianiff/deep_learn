Abstract    :
              Software for safety-critical control systems must be highly  reliable since
              failures can have catastrophic consequences.  A  novel approach is proposed for
              assuring ultrahigh reliability  requirements for these systems using multiple
              program versions  that satisfy different functionalities. One version
              implements  the safety-critical functions of the system while other versions 
              provide more optimal and refined control.  Each program is a  general relation
              that computes all possible outputs for an input.  The system output is obtained
              from the intersection of all the  output sets with a guarantee that the
              safety-critical version  will never be violated. This approach allows the 
              reliability of the system to be assessed cost-effectively.  It  also
              facilitates the use of advanced adaptive and learning  control algorithms for
              the non-safety-critical versions.  The project includes analysis of the
              properties of the  architecture, syntax and semantics of relational programs, 
              efficient relational composition methods, cost-effective  reliability
              assessment methods, supporting tools for writing,  executing, and dynamically
              composing relational programs, and  evaluation of the diverse-capability
              architecture using several  problems.  The successful completion of this
              research will result  in a scientifically rigorous and practical approach for
              achieving  certifiable high assurance for safety-critical  systems.
