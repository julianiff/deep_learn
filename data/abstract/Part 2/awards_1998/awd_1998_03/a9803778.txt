Abstract    :
                   This project involves the experimental study of the  properties of strongly
              interacting particles of matter known  as hadrons.  These hadrons which include
              protons, neutrons,  and mesons, as well as their excitations, are what atomic 
              nuclei are composed of, and constitute about 99% of all  ordinary matter on
              Earth.  The hadrons themselves are  composed of quarks and strong energy called
              gluons.  Surprisingly, we do not yet know how quarks and gluonic  energy are
              arranged to produce the properties of prosaic  matter.  Our research group will
              study quark and gluonic  properties of hadrons and their excitations using
              primarily  the new high precision superconducting electron accelerator  CEBAF
              at Jefferson Laboratory.  in preparation for these  experiments, we had been
              working for many years on the  design and construction of large particle
              detectors using  the leading edge technology.  Several graduate students will 
              obtain Ph.D. degrees based on these experiments, and many  undergraduates will
              obtain hands on experience with modern  technology.
