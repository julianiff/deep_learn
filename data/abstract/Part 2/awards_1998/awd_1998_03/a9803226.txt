              Scanning: Acquiring and Modeling Surface Properties    Abstract:    3D scanning
              is the inverse of computer aided manufacturing: given a   physical object, such
              as a clay model of a car, a sculpture, a chair,   or a house, create an
              electronic representation capturing its shape  and appearance.  3D scanning is
              similar in principle to a number of  other important technologies (like digital
              audio, digital photography,  document scanning, and digital video) that
              quickly, accurately, and  cheaply record useful aspects of physical reality. 
              These technologies  have had an enormous impact, primarily because electronic 
              representations can be used in ways the original physical objects  cannot. For
              example, they can be stored in, searched for, and  retrieved from databases,
              transmitted electronically over long  distances, manipulated and edited in
              software, and used as templates  for making electronic or physical copies. 
              Research in 3D scanning  promises to have a similar impact on a number of
              areas, including  the Federal Strategic Areas of high performance
              communication, civil  infrastructure, and manufacturing, as well as virtual
              museums,  entertainment, and product marketing.    This research group and
              others have made significant progress in  capturing, modeling, and displaying
              geometric shape.  The task of   acquiring and computing surface properties such
              as appearance,   however, has received far less attention.  The research effort
              in this   project focuses on three aspects of the problem: (i) texturing, bump 
               mapping and selective refinement of multiresolution meshes, (ii)   capturing,
              modeling and displaying radiance (color as a function of   position and
              direction), and (iii) generally estimating functions over   surfaces.
