Abstract    :
              9803260  Vinogradov  This conference on Oxygen Binding and Sensing Heme Proteins
              will bring together researchers from many specialized areas related to the
              structure and function of heme proteins and enzymes.  A forum for newly
              independent investigators and postdoctoral fellows will be provided at a poster
              session.  Women and minority scientists are represented  in lectures and as
              discussion leaders.  The biotechnology industry will be represented as well. 
              The venue is the Asilomar Conference Center, from 9/27/98-10/2/98.

 This
              conference will provide a forum for the latest research results in heme
              containing proteins and enzymes.
