Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803904  Mark L. Siegal    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              molecular  evolution of the sex-determination pathway in insects.  Sex 
              determination in Drosophila is a model for genetic  hierarchies in development.
              The well-known variety of  primary sex-determining mechanisms suggests that sex
               determination is exceptionally plastic, changing often in  evolution. A
              comparative approach is being taken to probe  the divergent modes of genetic
              sex determination in insects,  with reference to the detailed knowledge from
              Drosophila.
