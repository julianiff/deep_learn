Abstract    :
              This award will support research on mathematical models for nonlinear 
optical
              media.  These models have the form of nonlinear partial differential
              
equations that are integrable, i.e. that can be completely linearized in a
              
certain sense, and of perturbations of such equations.  The goal of the
              research 
is to further our understanding of chaotic excitation mechanisms for
              such 
models and to obtain specific solutions that correspond to periodic or
              single-pulse
waveforms.  The theoretical results will also be used as
              benchmark problems for
numerical computation schemes.

Mathematical models
              for optical media such as optical fibers and ring-laser
cavities have the form
              of nonlinear differential equations.  This research 
will address properties
              of such models that predict the behavior of such media.
Examples include the
              natural shape and duration of light pulses that can 
travel along such fibers
              and the spontaneous generation of noise within the medium.
