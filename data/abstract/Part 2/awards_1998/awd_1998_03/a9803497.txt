Masur will work on several topics involving the mapping class group
              and
Teichmuller theory.  He will finish his joint work with Yair Minsky
              on
the  combinatorial group theory of the mapping class group.  This
              work
includes  solving the conjugacy problem and finding a
              biautomatic
structure.  The  method has been to use the hyperbolic structure
              of the
complex of curves.   Masur will begin a study of the large scale
              or
asymptotic geometry of the  mapping class group.  This study is related
to
              the study of the  quasi-isometries of Teichmuller space.  Masur will
continue
              his work on the  representation theory of the mapping class
group.  He will
              study certain  functions called conditional negative
kernels, with the goal of
              proving  that the group does not have Kazhdan
property T. He will also study
              whether  surface groups admit
homeomorphisms to the mapping class group, which
              is  related to the
study of surface bundles over surfaces, a problem in 
              4-manifold
theory.

The field of surface topology is the study of those
              properties of
surfaces  that do not change under deformations.  The field
              interacts
strongly with  other disciplines within mathematics, such as
              complex
analysis, and with  outside disciplines such as physics.  The
              mapping
class group, which is the  group of self mappings of the surface, is
              a
fundamental object of study.   Many mathematicians over the years
              have
studied the group from a variety of  viewpoints.  Recently, powerful
new
              geometric tools have been introduced to  study groups, which are
the objects
              of symmetry in mathematics.  The  principle investigator is
working to bring
              these new geometric ideas into  the study of surfaces
and the mapping class
              group.
