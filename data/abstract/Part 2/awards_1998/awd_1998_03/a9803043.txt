Abstract    :
              9803043  Reynolds    The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Robert R. Reynolds of the University of 
              Arkansas to work with Dr. Victor M. Alexandrov at the  Institute for Problems
              of Mechanics, Russian Academy of  Science in Moscow on the development of an
              improved method  of predicting and analyzing the vibrations of structures  that
              are subject to transient loads.  This procedure, known  as Transient Asymptotic
              Modal Analysis (TAMA), will permit  design engineers to estimate these
              responses using only a  small personal computer.    Dr. Alexandrov has been
              working in mechanics research for  over 36 years, and has made significant
              contributions in the  field.  He will provide a unique perspective that is not 
              available to the applicant in the U.S.  This institute has a  reputation as
              being one of the premier research  organizations in the world.      ***
