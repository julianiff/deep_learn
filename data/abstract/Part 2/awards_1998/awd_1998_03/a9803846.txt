Abstract    :
                 The purpose of this project is to examine how different environmental
              conditions and the presence or absence of closely related species (sympatric
              congeners) affect the diet, activity, and ranging patterns of a small-bodied,
              leaf-eating (folivorous) primate, the gentle gray bamboo lemur  (Hapalemur
              griseus).  This will be accomplished by studying H. griseus at two research
              sites within Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, which are five kilometers
              apart.  These two sites differ in altitude, degree of habitat degradation,
              forest composition, and the presence or absence of the two other species of
              bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur (H. simus) and the golden bamboo lemur
              (H. aureus).  These factors may influence the diet, activity, and ranging
              patterns of H. griseus because the two sites differ in a) the amount and type
              of available resources and b) competition imposed by the larger, closely
              related species.  In addition, the length of this study  (15 months) will allow
              for the analysis of the seasonal changes in these behaviors.  Finally, chemical
              analyses of the plant parts ingested by H. griseus compared to those available
              at the two sites may provide clues as to whether environment or competition
              impose greater constraints on the ecology of this species.
