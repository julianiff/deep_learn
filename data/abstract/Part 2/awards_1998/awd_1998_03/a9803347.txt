              Abstract    Proposal: DMS 9803347  Principal Investigator:  Shing-Tung Yau     
              We propose to apply techniques of nonlinear partial differential equations   to
              solve several problems in geometry: the problem of defining center of  
              gravity, angular momentum in general space time and their applications to   the
              nonlinear stability of Schwarzchild solution.  The problem of studying  
              coupled Einstein-Dirac equation and their physical significance.  The   problem
              of applying nonlinear analysis to simplicial complices, including   graphs and
              buildings that can be used in combinatorial questions and   discrete group
              theory.  The problem of deforming Riemannian metric by using   Hamilton's
              equation and understanding their long time behavior that may   lead to
              understanding of topology of three manifolds.  We also want to   study the
              space of Lagrangian three manifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds whose   moduli
              space will lead to understanding duality questions in string theory.    The
              success of this proposal will bring in strong interaction between   mathematics
              and modern and classical physics.  Here classical physics   include general
              relativity, where strong geometrical and analytical   technique play a very
              important role.  Modern physics includes String   theory whose impact on
              mathematics has been tremendous.  The study of   nonlinear system of equations
              should give a breakthrough in understanding   low dimensional geometry and
              topology .  A thorough understanding of such   equations should bring in new
              technique to solve difficult problems in   applied mathematics.  Hopefully,
              eventually some fluid equations can be   treated by similar technique.
