Abstract    :
              9803522  Freidlin   Perturbations of the Hamiltonian systems will be studied in
              this project. The long-  time behavior of such perturbed systems, even if the
              perturbations are purely deterministic,   should be described by a stochastic
              process on a graph related to the Hamilton function. A   class of asymptotic
              problems for PDEs, such as the small viscosity asymptotics for the  
              Navier-Stokes equations in the plane or small diffusion asymptotics for
              reaction - diffusion   in  an incompressible fluid, are closely related to
              random perturbations of the Hamiltonian   systems. The probabilistic approach
              is useful in analyzing these problems.   Long time behavior of dynamical
              systems perturbed by a stochastic noise is studied   in this project. This type
              of problem arises in many applications, for example, the long time   behavior
              of cosmic objects or the motion of a fluid with a small viscosity. The  
              perturbations, even if they are small, become essential for the long-time
              behavior of the   system. The asymptotic approach, which the investigator is
              developing in the project, is   the most promising for analyzing this type of
              problem.
