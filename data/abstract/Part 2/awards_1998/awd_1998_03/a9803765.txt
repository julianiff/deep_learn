Over the past three years, this group has tested and
              refined a new type of torsion pendulum instrument to measure extremely small
              forces (torques).  This technology sidesteps the current impediment to further
              increases in signal-to-noise ratio for torsion pendulum measurements--fiber
              temperature variations--and opens new possibilities for high-precision tests of
              gravity and related experiments.  They plan to employ this instrumentation to
              carry out the test for non-Newtonian interactions.

Based on the measured
              performance of this prototype instrument and detailed calculations of the
              limiting systematic effects posed by Newtonian gravity, they find it possible
              to set an upper bound on the strength of any non-Newtonian potential with a
              range between 10 and 20 centimeters, that approaches 10-5 of the strength of
              ordinary gravity.  This is more than an order of magnitude below existing
              experimental bounds at this range or any range of terrestrial
              dimensions.
