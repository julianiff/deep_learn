Abstract    :
              Modern telecommunication systems demand high performance  circuit components 
              that can operate at billions of cycles  per second. Such components must also
              work in extreme  environment such as high and low temperature. For example, 
              components in a cellular phone must operate properly whether  it is  used in
              Texas during the summer or in Alaska during  the winter. Furthermore, these
              components must be  economically competitive. These strict technical and 
              economical challenges call for new approaches at the  component level. The
              recent advances in fabrication of  minute mechanical  devices may make possible
              the  implementation of high-frequency components  that can  address the
              aforementioned challenges. This research  involves the design of micromachined
              electro-mechanically  tunable capacitors for RFIC applications in the 1-2 GHz 
              range. The investigators are examining the effects of  various physical
              phenomena such  as gravity, shock, ware,  and temperature on tunable capacitor
              characteristics. The  researchers are also studying the feasibility of RF
              voltage  controlled oscillators and electronically tunable filters  based on 
              these micromachined devices. RF switches are also  being investigated. A
              prototype two-plate micromachined  varactor is being fabricated in MUMPS
              polysilicon surface  micromachining technology and has a nominal capacitance 
              of  2 pF, a tuning range of 1.5:1, a maximum control voltage of  4 Volts, and 
              a Q-factor of 20 at 1 GHz. The first prototype  voltage controlled oscillator
              based on such micromachined  tunable capacitor oscillates at 1.35  GHz, has a
              tuning  range of 2 percent, and has a phase noise of -98.5 dBc/Hz at  100 kHz
              offset from the carrier.
