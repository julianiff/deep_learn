              participation in transformed quality organizations in the automobile industry. 
              It will explore how interorgnizational learning and diffusion of knowledge and
              practices takes place between Saturn and GM's brownfield operations.  An
              important objective of the research is to examine the channels and
              opportunities as well as barriers for learning.
