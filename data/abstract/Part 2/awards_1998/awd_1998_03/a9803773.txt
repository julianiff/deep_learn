Abstract    :
              The Midwest Geometry Conference is an annual meeting dedicated to the
              dissemination of important recent advances in Differential Geometry, Geometric
              Analysis, and Integral Geometry to the community of Midwestern mathematicians.
              Each conference is devoted to a small number of topics that are central in
              geometry and geometric analysis or bring up important and productive
              connections with other fields of mathematics and applied science.  The aim is
              to create a focused environment, bringing together leading mathematicians in
              the different fields of mathematics and students or young professionals that
              have just started their career.
