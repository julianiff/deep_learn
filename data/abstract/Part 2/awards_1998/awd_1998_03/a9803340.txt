Abstract    :
              In the past 40 years, spline functions (in their simplest form,
piecewise
              polynomials) have become a well-established
computational tool, and are now
              widely used by scientists
and engineers. They are used for a variety of
              purposes,
including approximating curves and surfaces,
fitting data,
              computer-aided geometric design (CAGD),
computer-aided manufacturing (CAM),
              solution of differential equations,
image processing, etc. The aim of this
              research is to continue to develop
the theory and applications of
              splines,
and to create and test algorithms for solving some
              specific
applications problems, especially problems arising in
CAGD, CAM,
              geology, geophysics, and meteorology.
