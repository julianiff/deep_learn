Abstract    :
              9803491  The proposed project is concerned with developing a formal basis  for
              object-oriented (OO) analysis and design modeling. There are  two major
              components to the research: OO concept formalization  and method development.
              In the concept formalization phase, core  OO modeling concepts and their
              compositions are identified and  precisely characterized, and rigorous
              techniques for analyzing  and refining/elaborating OO models are developed. The
              focus of  the method development phase is on the creation of a rigorous 
              software development method, based on the standard Unified  Modeling Language
              (UML), that utilizes the formalized concepts  produced in the previous phase. 
              The proposed research will  deepen understanding of OO modeling and analysis
              concepts, and  pave the way for the development of rigorous development methods
               based on OO modeling techniques. The research is also intended to  produce
              results that can be used as part of the foundation for  ongoing efforts at
              standardizing OO modeling language  semantics.***
