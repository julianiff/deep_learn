Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Hudson will use inelastic incoherent neutron scattering
              (IINS) spectroscopy to investigate low frequency motions of hydrogen atoms in
              polycrystalline samples.  Comparisons of theory with experiment will be carried
              out to test the reliability of ab-initio methods by examining their ability to
              produce accurate eigenvectors for hydrogen atom motions in terms of the
              contribution of H-atom motion to particular normal modes.  Molecules to be
              studies include those for which (a) empirical or ab-initio methods are expected
              to fail; (b) experimental analysis of vibrational spectrum is ambiguous; (c)
              vibrations have not previously detected using optical methods; and (d) the
              molecule exhibits strong intermolecular interactions.  Hudson proposes to use
              the ISIS pulsed neutron spallation source at the Rutherford Appleton Lab (RAL)
              in England.

The studies proposed here are crucial to understanding a wide
              variety of fundamental processes in the condensed phase, including the
              mechanisms by which energy flows in biological molecules.  The technique of
              neutron scattering spectroscopy currently provides the most straightforward
              method for addressing such questions.  As a result of the outcomes of this
              project, more scientists in the United States can be expected to become
              involved in work with neutron sources.
