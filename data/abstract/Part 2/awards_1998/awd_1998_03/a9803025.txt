The National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) has recently added
              two new infrared extraction ports which will support a total of 5 new
              beamlines.  One of these is dedicated to solid state research, which requires
              long wavelength spectral range coverage.  The synchrotron source possesses both
              power and brightness advantages (by factors of ~10 and ~1000, respectively)
              over conventional sources in this usually difficult spectral range.
This award
              supports the development of a comprehensive facility for infrared spectroscopy
              in magnetic fields up to 15T.  The basic elements of the instrumentation are a
              far-IR spectrometer and a superconducting magnet.  Two principal modes of
              operation are considered: "traditional" magnetotransport and magnetic
              modulation spectroscopy (MMS). Used as an IR magnetotransport device, the
              instrument will allow us to study small samples, where the brightness of the
              source is crucial.  In the MMS mode the facility will open up novel ways of
              studying conduction electron spin resonance (cESR) in metals and insulators,
              optically detected resonance in semiconducting quantum structures, and magnetic
              modulation spectroscopy in general.  The materials to be investigated include
              compounds of colossal magneto-resistance, high temperature superconductors,
              fullerenes, semiconductors and epitaxial semiconducting structures and other
              systems.
The instrumentation will meet the needs of a wide range of users
              wanting to explore optical properties of solids in magnetic fields.  User
              access will be managed in the framework of the NSLS user program, providing
              free beamtime for the projects approved in a scientific review
              process.
