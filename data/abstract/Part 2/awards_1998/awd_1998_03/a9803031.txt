Abstract    :
              9803031  George    Nannobacteria are small (generally ~0.1 um, but ranging from
              0.025-0.3um diameter) features that appear as spheres, ovoids, rods, or linked
              chains of balls.  They were first discovered in rocks during high-magnification
              (>50,000X) SEM study of Hot Springs travertine from Viterbo, Italy.  The
              Morphologic similarity between the small features in the travertine and
              "normal" bacteria, and their tendency to occur clustered in colonies in the
              same manner as bacteria, lead Folk (1992) to propose that the features were
              "dwarf form" bacteria.  He further suggested that they promoted precipitation
              by creating microenvironments conducive to nucleation due to cation attraction
              to a negatively charged cell wall (Folk, 1993a; see also Beveridge, 1989).   
              Because nannobacteria are about one-tenth the diameter (1/1000 the volume) of
              "normal" bacteria (the term "nannobacteria" was first used by a microbiologist
              researching starved, therefore small, bacteria (Morita, 1988) their nature or
              origin is a point of significant microbiological controversy.  The primary
              argument against nannobacteria being free living organisms is that they are too
              small to contain a genome (biosynthetic capacity including ribosomes), and a
              cell wall or membrane.  This argument, however, is based on the following
              assumptions that may not be true: that the proportion of the nannobacterial dry
              weight that is DNA would be comparable to that of known full-size bacteria;
              that the water content of nannobacteria is comparable to that of known
              vegetative organisms; and that nannobacteria are free-living.  Alternative
              hypotheses for the nature of nannobacteria include bacterial parasites,
              bacterial spores/resting stages, mineral precipitation around cell fragments,
              or precipitation around large organic molecules.  Experimentation has shown
              that these ball-and ellipsoid-shaped textures are not the result of
              gold-coating, acid-etching, beam damage, nor are they contaminant trace
              minerals (Folk and Lynch, 1997).
