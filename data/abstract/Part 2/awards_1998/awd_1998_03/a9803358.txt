 A Mathematical
              Investigation of 2-D and 3-D Stokes flow

 This proposal outlines a
              mathematical investigation of a class of
 free boundary problems for slow
              viscous fluid regions in both two and
 three dimensions. Following recent
              remarkable results on the mathematical 
 structure of such nonlinear free
              boundary problems in 2-D, we seek to 
 extend the methodology to free boundary
              problems in three dimensions,
 as well as extend the results to more general
              doubly connected fluid
 regions in two dimensions.

 Slow viscous flows
              arise very naturally in many problems of drops and 
 bubble motion. These are
              very important in engineering applications.  
 Most of the work in this area
              relies heavily on computer calculation; 
 for cases when the bubble boundary
              becomes complicated, such methods are
 known to run into difficulties. The
              proposal is to extend the known
 mathematical techniques so as to complement
              existing computer calculations
 with pencil and paper results that gives
              better intuition on the precise
 parameter dependences in at least a few of
              these problems.
