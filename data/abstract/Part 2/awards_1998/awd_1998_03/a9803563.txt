Abstract    :
              9803563 Werth The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms of
              competitive sorption of organic chemical mixtures in soils and groundwater
              sediments and to predict its effect on bioavailablility.  Such understanding
              could lead to development of models and rate parameters to better predict
              results of in situ bioremediation of organic mixtures in soils and groundwater
              sediments.  Competition between chemicals in a mixture can dramatically alter
              equilibrium distributions and slow desorption rates from those measured for
              individual compounds; therefore, models based on studies of individual
              compounds do not accurately reflect observations in practice.  Specific
              objectives of this research are to:  1) determine the effects of competitive
              sorption on equilibrium distribution values as a function of soil composition
              and structure,  2) determine the effects of competitive sorption on fast and
              slow diffusion rates as a function of soil composition and structure and  3)
              develop a mechanistically based numerical model that predicts the
              bioavailability of mixtures in soils and sediments.  Results of the research
              are expected to allow decision makers to gauge if competitive sorption limits
              bioavailablilty and to evaluate the persistence and risk of sorbate mixtures in
              the subsurface.  It will also present an analytical tool to allow researchers
              working in related areas to measure long term desorption isotherms and fast
              desorption kinetics for mixtures.  Several new molecular sieves (UTD-1 and
              MCM-41) will be used to compare the effects of competitive sorption in
              micropores and small mesopores to the effects of competitive sorption in
              natural solids.  ***
