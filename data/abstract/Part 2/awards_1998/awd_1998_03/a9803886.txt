Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803886  Willie J. Swanson    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a  sponsoring 
              laboratory.   The  research  and  training  plan  for  this fellowship  is 
              entitled  "Molecular  evolution  of  reproductive   genes: Drosophila  male
              accessory gland proteins and their female receptors".  The diversification of
              several genes involved in  reproduction has  been  shown to  be  promoted  by 
              positive  selection, however, the selective  force(s) remain  unknown.  The 
              research  proposed  will  examine  Drosophila  male  accessory gland proteins
              and their female receptors in order  to understand the  selective  forces 
              driving their  divergence. The  results  may  yield insights into the  forces
              driving speciation.
