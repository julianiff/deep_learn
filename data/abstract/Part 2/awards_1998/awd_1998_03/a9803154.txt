Abstract    :
              This project  is devoted to innovative applications of the geometry of
moving
              frames  and the mathematical theory of differential invariants to
problems
              arising in computer vision, with emphasis on medical imaging. 
Since symmetry
              forms a basic component of the human visual system, it should be
naturally
              incorporated into mathematical methods for image processing and
              object
recognition. The image processing applications to be considered will
              include
denoising and smoothing, segmentation and edge detection, as well as
              object
recognition, including symmetry detection and partial occlusions.
              Practical
implementations will be based on the signature curve paradigm, that
              is based on the construction of suitable differential invariants for the
              symmetry group under consideration.  Metrics that distinguish signature curves
              of different objects will be compared, with the goal being to recognize and
              extract objects from both two and three-dimensional images.  Practical
              implementations of the image processing systems will rely on a new method of
              constructing symmetry-preserving numerical approximations to differential
              invariants that is to be developed as a part of this project.  The applications
              will be based on a new, practical theory of moving frames, that can be applied 
              to general group actions, both finite and infinite-dimensional.  Part of the
              project will be devoted to the further development of this general theory.
              Various additional applications, to problems arising in physics, geometry,
              invariant theory, and the calculus of variations, will also be
              investigated.
