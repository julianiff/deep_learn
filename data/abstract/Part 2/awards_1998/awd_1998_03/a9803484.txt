Abstract    :
              9803484  Ellis   One of the critical questions in tectonics regards the
              relationship among tectonic uplift, erosion and landscape, and climate. The
              question relates to the relative rates of erosion and uplift, and how they are
              affected by climate. This study will model landscape evolution over an active
              blind thrust fault.  Areas will be studied where the rates of bedrock
              landsliding, fluvial incision, regolith production, and hill slope diffusion
              can be calibrated.  If successful, this study will determine how sensitive the
              topography is to fault geometry and slip rate, and to quantify the competition
              between tectonics and climate.
