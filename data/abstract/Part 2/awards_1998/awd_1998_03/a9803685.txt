Building on an understanding of a fundamental
              self-sustaining process in 
shear-flows, an approach is developed to calculate
              hidden ordered states in 
shear flows such as plane Couette, plane Poiseuille
              and pipe flows. 
Knowledge of these states provides new starting points for
              the analysis of 
the onset of turbulence in shear flows. A complete
              characterization of the 
sequence of bifurcations leading to turbulence will
              be attempted based on 
the calculation of hidden steady states, analyses of
              their local stability 
properties and controlled numerical simulations. The
              striking similarity 
between those hidden ordered states and the coherent
              structures observed 
experimentally near boundaries will be investigated. It
              is also proposed to 
develop simplified models of the self-sustaining process,
              such as a low-
order model developed in earlier work.

This work illustrates
              the unique capabilities of high-performance 
Scientific Computing. The flow
              features that are revealed by this approach 
are not accessible by any other
              means, including analytical or 
experimental techniques or even numerical
              simulations. These features are 
the order hidden beneath the turbulence and
              their elucidation is of deep 
theoretical and practical interest. Turbulence
              is the defining characteristic 
of fluid flows in engineering and geophysical
              settings as well as of many 
biological flows. Therefore, progress in the
              fundamental understanding of 
turbulence is of wide-ranging practical
              relevance. A direct application of 
this research is to the development of
              robust models for prediction and 
control of turbulent flows in pipes and
              channels and over wings and 
surfaces, with an aim at drag and noise
              reduction.
