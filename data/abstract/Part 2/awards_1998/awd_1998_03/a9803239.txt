Houdre

Professor Houdre is investigating various topics in
              probability and statistics.  His theoretical work includes isoperimetric
              problems for product probability measures, graphs and Markov chains, jackknife
              based deviation inequalities and new directions in the study of random Fourier
              series.  His applied projects include studying the probability of error in
              biostatistical modeling as well as the application of deviation inequalities in
              aerospace engineering.

Professor Houdre's work in bioinformatics addresses
              questions of error inherent in popular genome sequencing algorithms which were
              used in the mapping of E. Coli and more recently, H. Pylori.  His work in
              aerospace engineering involves the application of stochastic algorithms to the
              design of high speed civil transportation aircraft.  The theoretical
              underpinnings of these applied activities will also be advanced since
              isoperimetric methods often provide good estimates of probability distributions
              which have a tremendous number of applications.  In particular, Professor
              Houdre will continue to bridge modern statistical resampling methods and
              distribution estimates for general classes of statistics. Finally his work on
              random Fourier series will provide tools and methods for the analysis of
              fractal-like physical phenomena.
