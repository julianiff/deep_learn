Fritelli
There is much research currently underway in carrying
              out numerical simulations of isolated systems with strong gravitational fields,
              both to study their dynamical behavior and to extract out the gravitational
              radiation created by their motion.  The description of such systems requires
              the solution of Einstein's system of nonlinear partial differential
              equations.

Professor Fritelli will initiate a new research program, which
              will examine the foundations of numerical simulations.  She will cast the
              Einstein equations in symmetric hyperbolic form, familiar to applied
              mathematicians and numerical analysts.  In this form, known powerful
              mathematical techniques can be brought to bear to study both the analytical and
              numerical properties of solutions to Einstein's equations.  This will
              illuminate the propagation of gravitational waves, and the control of numerical
              errors in computer simulations.
