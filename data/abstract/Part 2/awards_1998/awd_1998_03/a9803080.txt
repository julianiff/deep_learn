The Council of  Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) proposes
              to the National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Research Evaluation and
              Communication to lead a two-year project that will provide two research and
              evaluation products on the condition of science and mathematics education: (1)
              state-by-state and national indicators for monitoring progress in science and
              mathematics education; and (2) study of the effectiveness of systemic reform
              initiatives and state content standards in improving curriculum, instruction
              and student assessments.
