Abstract    :
              Abstract  9803539  A. Weimer, University of Colorado at Boulder  The objective
              is to develop a model for exothermically reacting aerosol particle generation
              mechanisms (coagulation, coalescence, and deposition) with application to
              combustion nitridation synthesis of fine ceramic particles, and to validate the
              obtained model with data from ceramic particle formation experiments.  An
              aerosol reactor shaped as a tube will be constructed with capabilities to
              measure temperature and wall deposition along the tube.  The P.I. will
              collaborate in modeling with Prof. S. Pratsinis (University of Cincinnati). 
              Several ideas are advanced for generation of ceramic composite particles and
              redirection of thermophoretic deposition from the reactor wall.    It is
              expected that an improved model for particle growth and structure, and a
              reduction of wall deposition in manufacturing of advanced ceramic powders by
              exothermic processing The research has relevance to high temperature synthesis
              of nonoxide ceramic material in aerosol flow reactors.  ***
