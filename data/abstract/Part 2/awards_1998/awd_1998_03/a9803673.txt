Abstract    :
              This project develops a novel architecture for the construction  of scalable
              Internet servers from commodity hardware and modular  application software
              components. The architecture targets network  servers based on clusters of
              workstations or PCs, and allows  servers to fully realize the performance
              potential of this  platform.  Off-the-shelf server applications are executing
              on the  server nodes in a modular fashion and are unaware of the  existence of
              multiple server nodes. As a result, ScalaServer  leverages both existing server
              applications and the  price/performance curve of commodity hardware.  The
              design of the  ScalaServer architecture will be based on the results of 
              extensive tracedriven simulations. Prototype systems for both  single-node and
              cluster servers will be disseminated to the  research community. It is expected
              that the project will  significantly advance the state-of-the-art in
              highperformance,  scalable, and cost-effective network server design and 
              implementation, an area that is critical to the future global  information
              infrastructure.  The project will also contribute to  the education of
              scientists and engineers in this important area,  both at the graduate and
              undergraduate level.***
