Mrowka
     This project will continue Mrowka's investigations into
              the study
of three- and four-dimensional manifolds (mathematical models
              for
space-time).  These investigations center on relating properties
              of
solutions and spaces of solutions of the various equations of
mathematical
              physics (primarily the Yang-Mills and Sieberg-Witten
equations) to the
              topology of the space-times that carry the
equations.  This strategy has been
              very successful in the past twenty
years, as evidenced by work of Yau, Schoen,
              Taubes, Donaldson, and
Uhlenbeck.  Mrowka hopes in joint work with Kronheimer
              to resolve a
30-year-old conjecture about the topology of three-dimensional
              spaces
known as the Property P conjecture, an important step
              towards
Poincare's conjecture that the simplest model of a
              closed
three-dimensional space-time is characterized by the property
              that
every closed loop is contractible to a point without leaving
              the
space-time.
