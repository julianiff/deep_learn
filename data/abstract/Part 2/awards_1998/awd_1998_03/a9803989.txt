Abstract    :
              9803989  Dabrowski    The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) will
              develop Engineer It! Dissemination of a Successful Multiple Outcome Exhibition.
               This will be a 5000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit based on their NSF supported
              exhibit Engineer It! that opened as a permanent exhibit at OMSI in 1994.  The
              exhibit presents visitors with an environment rich in opportunities to design,
              engineer, and test structures in three testing areas focusing on water,
              structures, and wind.  Visitors will learn basic engineering principles through
              experimentation by designing boats, buildings, bridges, cranes, windmills, and
              paper airplanes among other things.  Supporting components include training
              workshops for host museums on how to most effectively use the experimental
              environment of the exhibit, a Teacher's Guide, take-home activities, and a web
              page.  The primary audience is the general museum visitor which includes many
              families, and elementary school students.  Careful attention will be given to
              the development of family friendly exhibit text that will help adults
              understand how children learn from developmentally appropriate hands-on
              activities and how they can support that learning through adult-child
              interaction.  The content of the exhibit is in synchrony with national science
              standards.
