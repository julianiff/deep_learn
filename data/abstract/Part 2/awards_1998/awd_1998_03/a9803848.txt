The William and Mary group, in conjunction with
              collaborators from UCIrvine, UTAustin, Stanford U, and Richmond U, plans to
              continue its program of searching at high sensitivity for the rare dilepton
              decays of the long-lived neutral K meson.  These include the
              lepton-nonconserving decay to a muon and an electron, and the flavor-changing
              neutral current decays to a muon-antimuon pair and to an electron-positron
              pair. This work, Experiment E871, is carried out at the AGS Facility of the
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The objective of single-event sensitivity at a
              level of one-to-two parts in a thousand billion appears within reach based upon
              available data. An extensive analysis now in progress has revealed the first
              observation of di-electron events. 
Using the E871 detector a separate
              experiment E935 has also been run by UCIrvine, Richmond U, and William and Mary
              which attempts to probe for evidence of a low mass gluon.  Specifically a
              search is made for the decay of a long-lived gluon-gluino hadron to a pair of
              charged pions and a photino.  Limits can then be placed on a low mass gaugino
              scenario of supersymmetric particle theory.  
Within the past five years three
              William and Mary graduate students have written their Ph.D. dissertations based
              on this work.  In addition this program has led to seven undergraduate senior
              honors research theses.  This commitment to education by the William and Mary
              group at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will continue in the
              future.
