Abstract    :
              Abstract - 9803123  Ljubicic      The proposal is to partially support a
              workshop on Flow Induced Vibration in Heat Exchangers.  Flow induced vibrations
              lead to early failure of heat exchanger tubes by wear, fretting and fatigue. 
              The objective of the workshop is to investigate the prediction, diagnosis,
              correction, and prevention of acoustic and flow induced vibration by sharing
              information among the participants who represent industry and academia.  The
              program covers field data, research, modeling, and prediction of acoustic
              vibrations.  The proceedings will be available in a document published by the
              Heat Transfer Research Institute.
