Abstract    :
              Interior-point algorithms provide an efficient tool for solving optimization
              problems with various complicated constraints. Since iterations of
              interior-point algorithms lie in the interior of a feasible domain, it is
              possible to treat domains with complicated boundaries in a unified and simple
              manner.

The project is driven by recent applications of interior-point
              algorithms to robotics (motion planning, dextrous grasping ), speech synthesis
              (stochastic realization problem), robust stabilization (optimal control
              problems with frequency domain constraints) and other control applications. It
              is proposed to use various nonstandard mathematical tools (Jordan algebras,
              Riemannian manifolds, regularized determinants ) to expand the applicability of
              interior-point algorithms to new classes of feasible domains while keeping
              their efficiency (including estimates for the complexity of algorithms).
