Abstract    :
              9803618  Gross    This award supports research at a predominantly  undergraduate
              institution to study equilibrium structures  and structural dynamics in
              magnetorheological fluids.  In a  magnetic field, chains of micron-sized
              particles form. On  longer time scales, the chains may bind into thick 
              `columns.' Of particular interest are: (1) how do columns  form in the low
              volume fraction region where the  interactions between chains appears to be
              repulsive, and (2)  what is the internal and external equilibrium structure of 
              columns.  %%%  The PI will carry out research at a predominantly  undergraduate
              institution into a class of `complex fluids'  that consist of micron-sized
              particles and respond to  magnetic fields, for example, the viscosity of the
              fluid can  dramatically increase with the application of a small  magnetic
              field from the consistency of motor oil to that of  peanut. In an applied
              magnetic field, the small particles of  the fluid will form structures.  A
              better understanding of how these structures form is an  objective of the
              proposed research.  These `magnetically  active' fluids are used in numerous
              applications such as  vibration dampers,  brakes, and controllable clutches.
