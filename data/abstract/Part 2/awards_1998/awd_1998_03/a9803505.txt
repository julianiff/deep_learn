Abstract    :
              Software distributed shared memory (DSM) may support various  existing networks
              of workstations and distributed memory machines  built from commodity or
              customized microprocessors and networks,  without any hardware added. In order
              for DSM to be employed in  long-running applications or high-availability
              situations,  reconfiguration in response to processor failures or resource 
              changes is crucial and inevitable. From the performance  standpoint, a
              software-based DSM system ought to minimize its  coherence traffic overhead,
              because such a system is especially  sensitive to the traffic amount over the
              network.This research  proposal focuses on reconfiguration and performance
              issues in  software DSM under release consistency, aiming to render such DSM  a
              favorable computing paradigm.The key objectives of this research  include: (1)
              pursuing efficient algorithms for identifying target  structures in distributed
              systems under reconfiguration,  (2) investigating process migration by taking
              advantage of  multiple disjoint paths, (3) developing a recoverable software
              DSM  system based on fast checkpointing, (4) investigating into  aggressive
              implementations of release consistency  for software DSM, and (5) pursuing
              efficient barrier and  lock techniques for software DSM.
