              Tulane University  Project:         The Clifford Conference    Abstract:    The
              1998 Clifford Lecture and Conference, which will take place in   October of
              1998 at Tulane University.  The 1998 Clifford Lecturer is   Professor Peter
              Bickel of University of California - Berkeley, who   will give a series of 3
              lecturers on "The Method of Sieves in Non-   and Semiparametric Statistics". 
              During the conference, there will   be 10-15 invited speakers giving talks
              related to Professor Bickel's  main lectures.  These lectures and talks will:  
                 (a) compare and contrast the fields by examples, discuss how   bootstrap
              methodology fits into this framework, introduce the    method of sieves;     
              (b) discuss and review various applications of the method of   sieves to
              function estimation, Haar wavelet based tests, AR sieve    bootstrap, and more
              general use of orthonormal based or families    of bases or atoms in density
              estimation and other contexts;      (c) discuss the relation of the method of
              sieves to model   selection and the great challenge: Selecting Tuning
              Parameters.    The 1998 Clifford Lecture and Conference will provide a  unique
              opportunity for researchers to meet and discuss the current   issues in
              statistical theory and practice. This is particularly   beneficial to junior
              researchers, graduate students and faculty   from southern universities in or
              near Louisiana.
