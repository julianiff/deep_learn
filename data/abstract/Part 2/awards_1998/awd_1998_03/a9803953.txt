This program focuses on atomic-scale structure and dynamics
              of crystalline, glassy, and molten silicates and oxides, and emphasizes the
              application of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to obtain fundamental data to
              help better understand and predict processes of interest in geochemistry and
              geophysics. An unusual aspect of the program is in situ, high temperature NMR
              work to temperatures up to 1500C; the capability to extend this to high
              pressures (1 kb) and temperatures (1000 C) is currently under development. 
              High temperature research on melt structure and dynamics will be emphasized, as
              will studies of the corresponding quenched glasses with a variety of new NMR
              methods, including multinuclear and multidimensional techniques. For
              crystalline materials, the focus will be on experiments to
determine
              site-specific kinetics of exchange between water and minerals, and on the
              re-visiting of a number of questions of structural disorder using new NMR
              methods that give much improved resolution for quadrupolar nuclides such as 17O
              and 27Al.  Most of these projects will be greatly enhanced by the recent
              purchase of a new spectrometer by the P.I. and collaborators, a "wide bore" (89
              mm), 600 MHz (14.1 Tesla magnet) system that will be installed in the near
              future.
