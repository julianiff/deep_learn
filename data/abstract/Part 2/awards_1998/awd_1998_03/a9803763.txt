Through this proposed activity, the PI can carry out a
              program at an undergraduate institution, that completes the analysis of rare
              decays of the K-meson in experiment E871 at Brookhaven laboratory. Through a
              study of such decays, the effects of new physics outside of the Standard Model
              can be found.
