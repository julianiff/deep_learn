Abstract    :
              9803988  Wagner    The Zoological Society of Philadelphia will develop Primate
              Reserve.  This project will include the development of a two acre
              indoor/outdoor primate habitat for up to 60 primates and a variety of
              complementary programming including hands-on interpretative activities for
              visitors, a Discovery House/Conservation Action Center, live performances,
              school programs and teacher training activities that link with the formal
              education curriculum, and a World Wide Web site.  The goal of this program is
              to communicate basic information about primate biology, behavior, social
              structure, and habitats, and the problems face by primates in the wild. 
              Visitors are to learn that "Conservationists around the world work together to
              help primates and you can help too."  Specifically visitors will learn details
              about conservation biology/population biology including a) a species' biology
              affects its vulnerability to extinction, b) small populations are vulnerable to
              inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity, c) small populations in
              small areas are vulnerable to stochastic events, and d) these concerns apply to
              both wild and zoo populations.  To make the story more personal and to provide
              career role models, primatologists engaged in their research will be featured
              in the exhibit.  The exhibit will open in June, 1999 and the school program
              will begin October, 1999.
