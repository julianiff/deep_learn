Abstract    :
              9803659  Nelson    This grant provides 50% salary support over two years for 
              technical support in the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory in the  Dept. of
              Geological Sciences, University of Washington.  This  grant represents Phase II
              of technician support which follows on  three years support provided by Phase I
              (EAR-9417870). The  isotope geochemistry technician, G. Hinn, now has eight
              years of  experience in solid-source mass spectrometry, chemical  separations,
              acid distillation, and electrical and mechanical  maintenance critical to
              operation of the laboratory. He is  experienced in the anlayses of U-Pb, Sm-Nd,
              Rb-Sr isotope  systems, and has assisted in development of high-precision trace
               element analyses of Ca, Mg, K, V, U and Ba in minerals and  natural waters. A
              critical aspect of the technician's duties is  to monitor on a daily basis
              operation and adherence to protocol  by workers in the clean labs. He also
              participates in the  education of students and visiting researchers. For
              example,  during Phase I support, he taught and was a constant resource for 
              six undergraduate students who have been involved in research,  six graduate
              students and two post-doctoral researchers. Research  supported by the
              technical support grant spans a large range of  subjects but much of it follows
              four main scientific themes;  ocean island volcanism, tectonics and magmatism
              at continental  margins, modern and paleo-chemical fluxes in the oceans, and 
              migration of metals in the environment. As in the past, through  extensive
              collaborative work this grant will support the Isotope  Geochemistry Lab as a
              resource for students and colleagues not  only in Geological Sciences, but also
              in Departments of  Oceanography, Chemistry and Geophysics, and for colleagues
              at  other universities and colleges in the northwest.  ***
