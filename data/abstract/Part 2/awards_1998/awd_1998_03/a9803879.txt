Abstract    :
              9803879  There is a substantial body of literature devoted to directed  testing
              methods, which manipulate the choice of test inputs so as  to increase the
              probability and/or rate of fault detection. These  include most well-known
              testing methods, including functional and  structural testing.  A recurring
              problem with these methods has  been determining when to stop testing.  In
              contrast, a variety of  reliability growth models provide quantified measures
              of test  effectiveness in terms that  are directly relevant to project
              management, but at the cost of  restricting testing to representative
              selection, in which test  data is chosen to reflect the operational
              distribution of the  program's inputs. This research seeks a common ground
              between the  areas of directed testing and reliability modeling, allowing 
              statistical management of software testing without severely  restricting the
              choice of test method.  It explores reliability  models that can be applied to
              non-representative test processes  and improved data collection processes for
              reliability modeling.  Specific avenues of investigation include: 1) an order
              statistic  model of reliability growth based upon fault failure rates, 2)  the
              potential for employing fault failure rate information with  existing
              reliability growth models, and 3) the relative efficacy  of different
              techniques for measuring fault failure rates.***
