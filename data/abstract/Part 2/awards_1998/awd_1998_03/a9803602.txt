Abstract    :
              Turgay Uzer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research on Rydberg State Dynamics in Atoms
              and Molecules.    Uzer will study the dynamics of Rydberg states in atoms and
              molecules using classical and quantum approaches.  He will study the formation
              of very high molecular Rydberg states as related to
              zero-electron-kinetic-energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy and the synthesis of
              nonspreading wavepackets in atoms.   The research will rely heavily on the
              progress he has recently made in the theory of atomic and molecular Rydberg
              states perturbed by external fields - especially in problems involving Coriolis
              forces.

ZEKE spectroscopy has matured into a very high resolution
              spectroscopy for the study of short lived intermediates in chemical reactions. 
              It has even yielded the first direct spectroscopic data on elusive transition
              states of chemical reactions.  It also provides measurement to a very high
              degree of accuracy and at a resolution three orders of magnitude better than
              other major techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy.  Uzer's research
              will shed new light on the interpretation and potential applications of this
              powerful spectroscopic technique.
