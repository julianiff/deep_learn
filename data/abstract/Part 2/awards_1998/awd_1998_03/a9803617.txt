Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    Roger Howe, Dihau Jiang  Yale University  98 03617    This
              project tackles several problems in an area of number theory known as the
              Langlands Program. One problem concerns the periods of automorphic forms and
              special values of L-functions. The investigators also have some applications of
              residual representations and trace formula.  The third part of the study
              concerns Fourier coefficients of Eisenstein series and prehomogeneous vector
              spaces.      One of the most important mathematical ideas of the second half of
              the century, is that analytic formula  often encodes discrete information. For
              example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a particular
              equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find. On the other
              hand, you might want to count the number of solutions to a sequence of
              equations and have the answers as a sequence. Mathematicians call these kind of
              problems 'discrete'. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which
              calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic.'  Amazingly, the
              right kind of analytic function can contain the answer or answers to the
              discrete examples about.  Actually the first examples of this were discovered a
              couple hundred years ago,  but in the past thirty years, these examples have
              been systematized into a branch of number theory called the Langlands program.
