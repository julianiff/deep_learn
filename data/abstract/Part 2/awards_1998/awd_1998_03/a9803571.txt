Abstract    :
              The overall theme of this project is to explore the deep connections between
              convex geometry and combinatorial lattice theory, and to pursue applications in
              each direction.  From the geometric viewpoint, this project will focus
              particular attention on the structure of convex bodies, star-shaped sets, mixed
              volumes, and dual mixed volumes, with a goal of characterizing valuations and
              set functions that are invariant under various group actions and applying these
              results to problems in geometric probability, convex geometry, geometric
              tomography, and analysis on Grassmannians.  This project will also pursue an
              investigation of the many deep and previously unexploited connections between
              convex geometry and algebraic combinatorial theory, with the particular end of
              the development of a combinatorial theory of invariant valuations and kinematic
              formulas on finite lattices, (where the invariance is with respect to the
              action of an automorphism group).  A central goal of this investigation is the
              development and application of combinatorial analogues to Hadwiger's
              characterization theorem for invariant valuations and to classical kinematic
              formulas in the context of partially ordered sets, with a special focus on the
              combinatorial structures that arise in convex geometry.     Convex geometry and
              the theory of valuations treat the fundamental question of how to measure (or
              in the case of finite features, to enumerate) and ultimately to characterize
              intrinsic features of geometric objects. Examples include the reconstruction of
              information about a geometric object from limited data, such as information
              about projections and shadows (stereology) or slices and cross-sections
              (tomography).  These techniques lead in turn to many applications, such as
              those in biotechnology (such as molecular biology), economics and finance
              (analysis of efficient and equitable distributions of limited resources over a
              population), and computer graphics (the visual display of information).
