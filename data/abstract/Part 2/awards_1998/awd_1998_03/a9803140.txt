In this project the investigator will study the behavior of
              complex interactive 
systems with conserved quantities.  Their evolution is
              often described at the microscopic level while questions are asked at a much
              larger or macroscopic scale.  The transition from one scale to another always
              requires some averaging at the microscopic level and sometimes, as in the non
              gradient models, getting rid of certain divergences as well.  In the case of
              hyperbolic scaling, the macroscopic equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic equation
              that develops shocks.  The characterization of the microscopic profile of the
              shock is an interesting problem.  Studying the rescaled motion of a single
              tagged particle that interacts with large number of particles requires a
              central limit theorem to be proved under very minimal mixing
              assumptions.

Many complex physical systems consist of a large number of
              elementary components.  Each of these components interacts in some fashion only
              with a few neighboring ones.  However, the large system, as a whole, evolves in
              some complex manner due to the interactions of the individual components.  This
              project is devoted to the exploration of this phenomenon, in several concrete
              examples.  The goal is to provide mechanisms for making inferences about the
              behavior in the large scale based on assumptions on the nature of the
              interaction in the small scale.
