Abstract    :
              There is a wide gap in current knowledge about the types of conflict, conflict
              management strategies, and how management strategies are best linked to
              particular conflicts. Existing knowledge in this area has not been systematized
              or made formal and computational. This gap has significant practical impact,
              particularly in the important domain of collaborative design and concurrent
              engineering. Complex manufactured goods and software are increasingly designed
              using large-scale collaborative processes. Current, mainly manual, conflict
              management practices are being overwhelmed by the sheer scale and complexity of
              modern-day design challenges, leading to severe impacts on cost, timeliness,
              and effectiveness of product designs.  This research will develop, within the
              MIT Process handbook, a formally represented, publicly accessible repository of
              conflict management knowledge organized in a way that helps reveal building
              blocks, key dimensions and regularities, and thereby (2) facilitates important
              uses such as learning about conflict management and developing general theories
              of multi-agent conflicts and exceptions. This work makes important intellectual
              and practical contributions---it will be a key building block for better
              computational algorithms for managing exceptions (including conflicts) in
              collaborative work. The repository itself will help researchers carry on a more
              cumulative ans systematic exploration of the phenomena.
