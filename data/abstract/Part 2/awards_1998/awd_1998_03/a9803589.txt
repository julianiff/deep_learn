Abstract    :
              9803589  Kou    The object of this program is to better understand the 
              formation, structure and properties of the partially melted  zone formed during
              gas metal arc welding of aluminum alloys.  Gas metal arc welds are made on an
              aluminum-4.5% copper  alloy to examine the grain boundary structure and
              determine  the temperature gradient and growth rate.  Solute and  hardness
              distributions are determined across grain  boundaries by scanning transmission
              electron microscopy and  nano indentation.  Thermal effects are explored using
              pulsed  gas metal arc welding to determine effect on grain boundary  liquation.
               Benefits are expected based on the lower heat  input produced by the pulsing
              process.  Gleeble simulation  of the weld structure provides controlled, known
              thermal  cycles and nearly one dimensional heat flow to samples  undergoing
              grain solidification.  %%%  Gas metal arc welding is the most widely used
              process for  welding aluminum alloys.  The research has application to  the
              welding of aluminum structures, such as an all-aluminum  automobile body, one
              direction pursued to reduce the weight  of future automobiles.  ***
