Abstract    :
              AST 98-03071  Zinn    There are many complex processes intertwined in the
              chemical evolution of galaxies.  These include the chemical evolution in the
              universe before formation of galaxies, in the Big Bang, and possibly in the
              earliest stars which set the initial conditions for the chemical evolution in
              galaxies.  The chemical compositions of galaxies evolve with time as new
              elements are created in stars, returned to the interstellar medium, and
              incorporated into subsequent generations of stars.  A galaxy's chemical
              evolution involved a complicated interplay among star formation, stellar
              evolution, nucleosynthesis, stellar winds, and galactic winds.  In addition,
              random events such as the merger of galaxies or the accretion of gas by a
              galaxy may have had a profound effect on chemical evolution.   This cyclic
              process is exceedingly complex, and involves several poorly known processes and
              variables.    Probably the simplest form of this complex process occurs in the
              smallest, least complicated of galaxies, the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. 
              These galaxies are very low luminosity galaxies usually members of the Local
              Group.  Both the Milky Way and Andromeda are members of the Local Group. 
              Because of this simplicity, there is hope that the most important features of
              the chemical evolution of these galaxies may be isolated and understood.  In
              general, these galaxies contain very little, if any, H I gas.  There is clear
              evidence that stars formed over a large range in time, either more or less
              continuously or at separate epochs.  Dr. Zinn is studying in detail three dSph
              galaxies: in Draco, Ursa Minor and Sculptor.  He is obtaining spectroscopy and
              photometry of red giant stars in these galaxies to determine their metallicity
              distributions.  The comparison of these distributions with each other and with
              models may reveal the most important factors controlling the evolution of low
              mass galaxies.  ***
