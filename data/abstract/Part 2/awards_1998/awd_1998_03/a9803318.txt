Abstract    :
              9803318  Nagy      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Elizabeth A. Nagy to work with Dr. Urs
              Scharer  at the Universite' Paris in France.    Dr. Nagy will do an isotopic
              study of igneous and  metamorphic rocks from suture and shear zones in Vietnam 
              using radioactive isotopes to assign absolute ages, which  will fill a
              significant gap in the geologic data for the  region.  She will also examine
              possible relationships with  the Mesozoic Indosinian Orogeny and the Cenozoic
              India  Eurasia collision.  This research will lay the groundwork  for continued
              sampling and future studies in central and  South Vietnam, and possibly in Laos
              and Cambodia.    Dr. Scharer and other scientists in his lab have spent many 
              years studying the geology of these regions and are well  known experts who
              have reconstructed and defined much of the  geologic history of Indochina that
              is known today.    ***
