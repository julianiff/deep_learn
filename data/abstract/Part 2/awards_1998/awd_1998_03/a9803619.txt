Abstract    :
              9803619
He
     Infinitesimal deformation of disk patterns in the plane can
              be
characterized by harmonic functions on an electric network that
              is
obtained by a simple geometric construction.  Properties of the
electrical
              network may be used to derive rigidity properties of disk
patterns.  The
              technique may also be applied to prove characterizations
of three-dimensional
              convex hyperbolic polyhedra, generalizing both
Andreev's Theorem and a
              characterization theorem due to Hodgson and
Rivin.  The investigator will
              explore relationships between the
deformation of disk patterns and that of
              three-dimensional hyperbolic
cone-manifolds, and study the applications of
              these results to other
fields.  He will also continue the research on the
              Koebe uniformization
conjecture.
     The study of geometry and topology in
              two and three dimensions are
intimately related.  Many three-dimensional
              geometric topology problems
may be reduced to problems in two dimensions, and
              geometric structures
may be applied to solve topological problems.  This
              project's research
on disk patterns, three-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra,
              circle
domains and disk packings, three-dimensional geometric structures
              and
their applications, and on topological hydrodynamics, will contribute
to
              a better understanding of the geometry and physics of our real world.
It is
              also an interesting fact that geometric structures on manifolds
can be applied
              to yield information on their topology, and in turn the
information on their
              topology may be used in some problems in
hydrodynamics.  There is a related
              study of Moebius energy of knots and
links, where several most elementary
              questions remain unsolved. This is
a field where theory and experiment meet
              well.
