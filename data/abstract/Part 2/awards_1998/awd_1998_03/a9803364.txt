              Initiated   Principal Investigator:    Trung V. Nguyen  Affiliation: 
              University of Kansas    This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal
              investigator is Dr. Trung Nguyen at the University of Kansas. The research will
              attempt to improve the performance of fuel cells. The technology is based on
              increasing the efficiency of water management through an interdigitated flow
              field design of the electrodes.  A model will be developed to describe
              two-phase flow through a porous electrode. The model will be used along with a
              voltage stepping scheme to study the effects of liquid water distributions on
              the electrodes.  Results from the work will help determine optimal operating
              conditions and design parameters for the interdigitated flow field.    The
              proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system is being seriously considered
              as a power source for electric vehicles, portable electrical devices and remote
              power generation because of its non-polluting characteristics, theoretical
              efficiency, and simplicity in design and operation. For the PEM system to be
              cost effective however, its performance and efficiency in practice need to be
              further improved. This research will address a significant aspect of improving
              the performance of PEM fuel cells.
