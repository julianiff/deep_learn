Research will be carried out leading to an improvement in
              accuracy of the neutron lifetime.  A new cooling and trapping technique for
              neutrons will be developed based on energy dissipation in superfluid helium and
              trapping within a magnetic well.  The lifetime measurement will permit more
              precise tests of the standard model of electroweak interactions.  The
              experiment will be carried out at the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology research reactor.  This activity is multidisciplinary, bringing
              together low temperature techniques and nuclear physics techniques as well as
              understanding of condensed matter, molecular and nuclear phenomena.  The new
              trapping method proposed will also permit development of a new, intense source
              of ultra-cold neutrons for further nuclear physics studies and for future
              materials research studies.  The lifetime measurement and the possible study of
              triple correlations in neutron beta-decay are high priority activities in
              contemporary nuclear physics and studies of fundamental symmetries. 
              Improvement of existing state-of-the-art equipment is integral to this
              activity.  Education of graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs is a
              strong component in every aspect of this grant.
