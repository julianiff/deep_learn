Abstract    :
              9803102  Falk    Science Learning, Inc. will plan and carryout a tow day
              conference that will bring together researchers, practitioners and policy
              makers in an effort to seek to better understand the workings of the informal
              science education infrastructure.  Being promoted as a seminal event for
              defining and understanding the role of informal science education
              infrastructure in facilitating public understanding of science, conference
              participants will better define and delineate the informal science education
              infrastructure, hear about studies examining the nature and function of the
              informal science education infrastructure, learn about research models in other
              fields that are related to this question, and look toward the future by
              proposing studies and approaches to understanding this infrastructure even
              better.  This is an outgrowth of a projected ten-year research study conducted
              for LA's California Science Center looking at the impact of a major urban
              science center on its community.  This conference will be held in association
              with the May, 1998 annual meting of the American Association of Museums. 
              Participants will apply to attend; it is anticipated that approximately 100
              individuals will be selected.  The conference proceedings will be published and
              broadly dissemination after the conference.  It will include the nine formal
              papers presented at the conference along with summaries of the small groups'
              sessions and conclusion.  The James Irvine Foundation and the California
              Science Center will provide additional support for this conference.
