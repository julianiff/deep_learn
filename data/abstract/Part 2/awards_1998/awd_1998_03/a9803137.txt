Abstract    :
                AST-9803137  Norman    This multi-institution project is a coordinated effort
              by the former Grand Challenge Cosmology Consortium to explore systematically
              the observational consequences of theories of structure formation across
              multiple epochs, including recombinations, first structure formation,
              reionization, and the formation of galaxies, clusters, and large scale
              structure.  This multi-epoch approach to cosmology is meaningful because cold
              dark matter cosmogonies are mathematically precise, making definite predictions
              at all stages of cosmic evolution z less than or equal to 10^9.  The approach
              is now feasible by virtue of a new suite of multiphysics, high resolution
              hydrodynamic cosmology codes the team has developed for the coming generation
              of teraflopscale parallel supercomputers.  The physics of the gas and
              radiation, while computationally challenging, is nonetheless understood, and we
              are able to draw upon decades of classical astrophysics research in building
              our models.  The anticipated increase in computer power will improve the
              reliability of the models considerably.  This project is supported by NSF's
              Division of Astronomical Science, the Division of Physical Sciences, and the
              Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence Initiative.  ***
