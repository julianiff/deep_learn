Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803897  Yingquing Lu    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
              Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These 
              fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              evolving genes  of self-incompatibility in natural populations of  solanaceous
              species.  Self-incompatibility (SI) prevents  self-fertilization in many
              plants. Natural plant populations  of Physalis longifolia and Solanum
              carolinense are being  surveyed and patterns of genetic variation in allozymes
              and  SI specficities characterized. Numerical simulation studies  are used to
              infer from such information historical  demographic events and the nature of
              selective processes  operating in the natural populations.
