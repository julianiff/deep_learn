Abstract    :
              9803815  This research concerns models for concurrent computation. The  central
              problems are (1) building truly concurrent models for  concurrent languages,
              and (2) building models for unbounded  nondeterminism. Traditional models for
              concurrency resolve the  parallel composition of two processes into all
              possible  interleavings of the sequential actions of each. True concurrency 
              directly implements concurrent computation as a primitive  operator. This
              research will combine domain-theoretic approaches  with automata-theoretic
              techniques and trace theory to build new  models for concurrent computation
              based on true concurrency. The  goal is a better understanding of the
              difference between  nondeterminism and parallelism. Potential applications are
              models  of object-based concurrency and modeling the parallelization of  serial
              code. Applications to modeling security issues, especially  denial of service
              attacks are also being explored. A process is  unboundedly nondeterministic if
              it has infinitely many choices of  possible actions to perform. Models for this
              construct could be  used to extend existing models for bounded nondeterminism
              to ones  supporting unbounded nondeterminism. This would afford the  potential
              to reason about processes exhibiting unbounded finitary  behavior without also
              exhibiting infinitary behavior; for  example, a process which is capable of
              doing an action any finite  number of times, but incapable of doing it forever.
              Applications  involve specification and refinement, as well as fairness.***
