Abstract    :
              9803427  Kimura       This project's goal is to study the "representation ring,"
              in the  appropriate sense, of the (homology groups of the) moduli space of
              curves and  its close cousins.  Such objects are rigorous constructions of
              nontrivial  topological quantum field theories.  In the case of the moduli
              space of   curves, the corresponding representations are cohomological field
              theories  (in the sense of Kontsevich and Manin), the most dramatic examples of
              which  arise from Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth projective variety.  The
               investigator will study properties of canonical families of such structures 
              arising from the geometry of these moduli spaces, using techniques borrowed 
              from homotopy theory (operads), algebraic geometry (moduli spaces), and 
              quantum field theory (Feynman diagrams).       Recently, much of the
              interaction between mathematics and theoretical  physics has revolved about
              topological quantum field theories, quantum field  theories whose observables
              correspond to topological invariants.  A rigorous  construction of a nontrivial
              class of such theories is now possible through  the study of Gromov-Witten
              invariants, topological invariants associated to  a certain space of maps from
              Riemann surfaces into a Kahler manifold.  The  purpose of this project is to
              study natural families of such theories   (and their relatives) that arise from
              the geometry of these spaces and  to understand their properties under natural
              operations suggested by the  geometry.  Success should shed light on both the
              mathematics and the physics  involved.  ***
