Abstract    :
              The scientific tools used by Slemrod in his research on finding
multi-scale
              models for constitutive relations for gases, fluids, and 
granular materials
              are kinetic theories for these materials   
and singular perturbation limits.
              These singular perturbation limits 
allow him to recover models on large space
              and time scales. However 
the linking of the large and small scales in unified
              models will be 
accomplished by a new technique developed by Slemrod and
              motivated 
by the procedure used by physicists in the study of critical
              phenomena. 
Slemrod calls the  method" generalized rational approximation".
              
It provides a stable way of extrapolating from small scale to 
large scale
              models of materials. 

In the study of the dynamics of liquids, gases, and
              granular materials  
it is important to have good mathematical models to aid
              in the prediction 
of physical phenomena. It is also important to have these
              models to be 
valid on a whole range of length and time scales. For example
              the motion 
of the atmosphere (a rarefied gas) far away from a plane or a
              space shuttle 
re-entering the earth's atmosphere uses a large scale model
              different 
than that used to model the small scale dynamics of a shock layer
              near 
the plane or shuttle.  However for computational efficiency one unified
              
model valid on a large range of length and time scales is desirable. 
              
Slemrod  in his research will formulate a method for finding such models
              
for fluids, gases, and granular materials.
