Feighn
     Mark Feighn, with Mladen Bestvina and Michael Handel, will
              continue
the study of automorphism groups of free groups.  Abelian subgroups
              will
be described.  The Torelli subgroup of a mapping class group of a
              surface
or of the automorphism group of a free group is the subgroup that
              acts
trivially on first homology.  Morse theoretic techniques will be
              applied
to bordifications of Teichmuller Space or Culler-Vogtmann's Outer
              Space
in order to determine connectedness properties of Torelli groups. 
              Further,
the study of coherent groups will be pursued.
     Groups are
              fundamental algebraic objects.  They describe symmetries of
objects and so are
              important anywhere symmetry appears.  For example,
the symmetry group of a
              molecule in part determines the molecule's
chemical properties.  In a new and
              exciting field of mathematics,
geometric group theory, algebraic properties of
              the symmetry group of an
object are gleaned from geometric properties of the
              object.  Interesting
groups occur when the object itself is taken to be a
              group.  Mark Feighn
will continue to apply this technique in the study of a
              fascinating
class of groups, the symmetry groups of free groups.  Free groups
              play a
central role in the theory of groups, as any group may be obtained from
              a
free group.
