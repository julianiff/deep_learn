Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS -9803866    Principal Investigator:  Crowe     
                    This is a grant to support 10 promising young faculty to attend and 
              present papers at the Third International Symposium on Multiphase Flows to  be
              held in Lyon, France, June 8 - 12, 1998.  This will allow younger  faculty in
              the US to have the opportunity to keep abreast of developments  in this rapidly
              advancing field and to foster international cooperation.  The conference will
              cover dynamics of drops, bubbles and particles, physics  of dispersed flows
              including fluidized beds, bubbly and particulate flows,  flow structures and
              instabilities including solid-fluid and fluid-fluid  components, heat transfer
              and phase change, and applications in the power,  processing and manufacturing
              industries.
