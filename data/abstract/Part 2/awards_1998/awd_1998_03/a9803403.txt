              The purpose of the project is apply homological and sheaf theoretic  techniques
              as well as methods of deformation theory to symplectic  geometry and index
              theory. More specifically, the project will address  index theory in presence
              of singularities (boundary, corners), in the  equivariant setting,
              ``secondary'' (as in secondary characteristic  classes) phenomena, calculation
              of the asymptotic density of  Bohr--Sommerfeld orbits, symplectic reduction of
              quantized Hamiltonian  actions and other applications of deformation
              quantization to  microlocal analysis and symplectic geometry.    Many important
              quantities which arise in mathematics and physics can  be naturally interpreted
              as numbers of (independent) solutions of  systems of partial differential
              equations.  The object of the project  is to find new formulas for such
              quantities as well as investigate  various relationships among them. 
              Differential equations are  mathematical models of physical phenomena which is
              why it is important  to be able to ``count'' their solutions.
