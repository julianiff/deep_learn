Proposal:  DMS-9803606
Principal Investigator: Georgios
              Daskalopoulos

The principal investigator's main topic of interest is the
              application
of analytic methods to topological and geometric problems.
              More
precisely, in the first part of the proposal the principal
investigator,
              motivated by the existence of representations of
fundamental groups of knot
              complements, suggests a connection between
Yang-Mills theory on Riemann
              surfaces and Teichmueller theory. In the
second part, the principal
              investigator proposes to study certain
compactifications of character
              varieties of fundamental groups of
surfaces and three dimensional manifolds.
              The investigator relates
this to actions of groups on trees and incompressible
              surfaces on
three dimensional manifolds. In the rest of the proposal,
              the
principal investigator suggests certain questions about the metric of
the
              monopole moduli space which appear in physics.

The main motivation of this
              work is to understand questions about the
topology of three dimensional
              manifolds by studying representations of
their fundamental groups. The results
              in this project will advance our
knowledge in questions relating gauge theory
              on Riemann surfaces,
harmonic maps, Teichmueller theory and three dimensional
              manifold
topology. In addition, work in this subject will facilitate
              further
connections between certain aspects of mathematics and physics.
