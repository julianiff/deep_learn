This research program aims to synthesize a series of
              organometallic complexes consisting of ruthenium II, iron II, or osmium II
              coordinated to bipyridine-like ligands that exhibit unusual geometries and
              architectures.  The compounds will be characterized using a combination of
              electrochemistry and electron spin resonance (ESR) to determine properties such
              as electrocrystallization and the degree of electronic coupling between
              metallic centers, between theligand structures, as well as intramolecular
              charge and spin delocalization.  Novel solid-state materials will then be
              prepared from these compounds by electrocrystallization techniques to generate
              sisngle crystalline materials of sufficient quality to be analyzed using
              techniques such as x-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, power, and thermal
              conductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field.  The aim is to
              obtain a unique class of novel molecular materials with unusual and possibly
              technologically useful transport properties.
%%%
This interesting class of
              compounds is being explored as a source of highly unusual and very interesting
              materials exhibiting novel electronic, magnetic and optical properties.  These
              investigations may lead to the use of electrides as solid-state electronic or
              magnetic materials for devices.
