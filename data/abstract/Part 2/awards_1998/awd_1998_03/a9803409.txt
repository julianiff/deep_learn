Abstract    :
              9803409  Miller      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Henry L. Miller, Jr. to work with Dr. 
              Daniel S. McKenna at the Institute for Stratospheric  Chemistry in Julich,
              Germany.    Dr. Miller will use satellite temperature observations,  coupled
              with a three-dimensional stratospheric chemical  model to quantitatively
              validate model results with the  observation of ozone depletion trends,
              particularly in the  northern mid-latitudes.  Model runs can be used to examine
               the likely future effects of variations in temperature on  the northern
              mid-latitude ozone column.  These theoretical  examinations can increase the
              understanding of global  warming.    A three-dimensional model called the
              Chemical Lagrangian  Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) is being developed at
              the  Institute for Stratospheric Chemistry.  This will provide a  framework
              within which the effects of small-scale  temperature fluctuations can be
              examined.  *  *  *
