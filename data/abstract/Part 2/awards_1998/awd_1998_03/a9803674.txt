Abstract    :
              9803674  Claiborne    This award will support Mr. Conn Mallett, a Ph.D. student 
              under Professor Al Claiborne at Wake Forest University, to  conduct
              dissertation research in collaboration with  Professor Tomitake Tsukihara of
              the Institute for Protein  Research, Osaka University, Japan.  Mr. Mallett will
              spend  12 months working in Japan on crystallographic studies  focused on the
              structure of the flavoprotein NADH oxidase, a  key enzyme in streptococcal
              energy metabolism.  Use of the  host institute's macromolecular crystallography
              facility  will provide structural information which will complement  current
              studies on the kinetic and redox properties of the  enzyme.    This research
              will add to our fundamental understanding of  flavoprotein structure and
              function, and offers the  potential for application of structural information
              to the  design of new therapeutic molecules for fighting  streptococcal
              infection in humans.  Moreover, this project  enables collaboration between
              complementary laboratories in  the United States and Japan and provides
              international  research experience for an American graduate student.  ***
