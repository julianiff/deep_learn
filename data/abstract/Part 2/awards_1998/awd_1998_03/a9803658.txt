Abstract    :
              This project will develop methods to give mobile computers timely  access to
              changing data through improved data replication. When  remote replicas of files
              stored on a mobile computer are updated,  the system must balance data
              staleness against using scarce and  expensive network bandwidth to fetch the
              new version.  This  research will investigate methods to automatically predict
              when  files replicated on a portable computer should be reconcilied with 
              remote replicas, which files are of most importance to reconcile,  and which
              remote replica is  likely to have the freshest data.  The project will build on
              the success of the Seer predictive file  hoarding system. The predictive
              methods developed will rely on  information already kept for other purposes,
              plus a modest amount  of newly gathered information.  Simulation, analytic
              modeling, and  measurement will be used to determine suitable methods. The 
              project will produce a working prototype system. This research  will improve
              the quality of data for portable computer users.  It  will be applicable to
              other types of data, such as database  fragments or cached Web pages.
