This research focuses on dependence structures of random
              variables and associated large sample distributions.  Results are expected to
              include univariate and multivariate normal approximations, Central Limit
              Theorems and series expansions of distributions for dependent summands.  Such
              results will extend the classical theory, which assumes independence, and allow
              many new applications in statistics, combinatorics and computer science, where
              one deals with sums and counts of dependent variables.  Stein's methods play an
              important role in the proposal, but other methods are featured as well.  A
              careful study of convergence rates is proposed. Applications to game theory,
              large sample theory, particle systems in statistical mechanics and others, are
              described in the proposal.

The probabilistic behavior of large systems of
              particles, large statistical surveys, large computational systems, etc., is
              often studied by considering limits as the size of the system grows, and
              assuming independence of the particles, or opinions surveyed etc.  However, for
              many systems or sampling schemes, the dependence between the random outcomes
              cannot be ignored.  This research concentrates on methods of studying large
              systems or samples in the presence of dependence, and under various dependence
              structures.  The rate at which finite systems approach their limiting behavior
              is studied, thus allowing applications of the results to systems of a given
              finite size.
