The objective of this proposal is to design, build, and test
              InP Gunn oscillators for second-harmonic power generation at frequencies
              between 200Ghz and 300 Ghz.  The goal is to provide powerful, low-noise,
              compact, and efficient local oscillators for receiver systems.  The cost
              advantage of our approach would stimulate the development of commercial and
              military applications in the millimeter/submillimeter-wave region.  This effort
              is motivated by the PI's recent theoretical and experimental results
              demonstrating that high performance (RF output power > 100 mW) can be obtained
              from InP Gunn oscillators operating in the fundamental mode at D-band (110-170
              GHz) frequencies.

Gunn device structures with a graded doping profile in the
              active region will be designed, fabricated, and tested.  The design of the Gunn
              devices will be performed using a Monte Carlo simulator developed by the
              investigators.  The Hewlett-Packard High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS)
              will be used to analyze and design the resonant waveguide cavity.  Realistic
              estimation of the RF output power levels will be obtained by coupling the Monte
              Carlo and the HFSS results in a harmonic-balance technique.  These estimates
              will significantly expedite the optimization process.

The research effort
              will be conducted as a collaboration of SUNY at Stony Brook and the University
              of Michigan.  The design of the device and the resonant circuit will be carried
              out at Stony Brook by the PI and a graduate student.  The mount and device
              fabrication as well as the measurements will be conducted at the University of
              Michigan by Dr. Eisele and a graduate student. During the first year, a new
              processing technologies using beam leads and/or micromaching will be developed
              to simplify the packaging step as well as improve heat management, package
              parasitic, and reliability.  In the second year, oscillators will be developed
              for frequencies between 200 GHz and 260 GHz while in the final year oscillators
              will be developed for frequencies from 260 GHz to 300 GHz.

Successful
              completion of the project will provide compact and reliable locate oscillators
              with low noise and high performance in the upper millimeter-wave region.  This
              will either eliminate any varactor multiplier stage or at least greatly reduce
              their number in a local oscillator system, thus simplifying the design of such
              a system in low-noise receivers.
