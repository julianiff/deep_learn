Abstract    :
              This work will be focused on the concept of material mixing in dynamics.This
              
concept introduces spatio-temporal composites, i.e. material
              microstructures
assembled and maintained in space-time. Such composites will
              be investigated in 
the framework of a Maxwell system for moving dielectrics
              as well as for the 
relativistic equations of elastodynamics and acoustics.
              The relevant set of 
effective parameters (G-closures) will be explicitly
              specified for a number of 
practical examples.

The knowledge of G-closures
              is crucial for the analysis of material optimization
problems that arise in
              dynamics of moving media, particularly in acoustics and 
hydroacoustics, as
              well as in high frequency electronic engineering. Such a 
knowledge makes many
              of these problems well-posed when the material coefficients
act as the control
              factors. Physically, this is because the optimal material 
layouts in
              space-time generally shape themselves as microstructures.
This work is aimed
              to prepare a conceptual basis for a subsequent investigation 
of material
              optimization in dynamics.
