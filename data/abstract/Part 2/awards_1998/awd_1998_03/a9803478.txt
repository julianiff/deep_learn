Abstract    :
              Abstract      Proposal Number:  CTS 9803478, CTS 9803683    Principal
              Investigator:  Hirsa/Lopez    This is a grant to study the intrinsic properties
              of surfactant-influenced gas/liquid interfaces.  The program will capitalize on
              newly developed non-invasive optical techniques for surface chemistry and
              interfacial hydrodynamics.  These properties will be measured directly and
              incorporated into the governing equations that are derived from first
              principles without the need for phenomenological modeling.  A focused,
              interdisciplinary research effort incorporating the theoretical formulation of
              the problem, surface chemistry and hydrodynamic experimentation and
              measurement, and numerical simulation set the stage for a possible  major
              breakthrough in the field of interfacial flow dynamics.  Applications of
              surfactant hydrodynamics are diverse and include material (e.g. plastics) and
              food processing, fuel injection spray and atomization, two-phase flow, C02
              transport across the ocean surface, and pulmonary surfactant therapy.  Also,
              the development of new surfactants can benefit from the results of the proposed
              project from improvements in the methodology to measure the intrinsic
              interfacial properties.  These measurement capabilities coupled with the
              predictive model can shift the design of surfactant materials from a
              trial-and-error process to a systematic design paradigm based on the principles
              of mechanics.  The aim of this project is to elucidate the role of intrinsic
              interfacial properties, including surface viscosities (dilatational and shear)
              and transport kinetics, on the bulk and interfacial transport processes through
              a mechanistic formulation.  This will be accomplished with a simple,
              reproducible, steady-state flow field, using an experiment in an annular
              channel flow (the deep-channel viscometer).    1      1
