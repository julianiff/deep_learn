Abstract    :
              The main physics goals of this project are two-fold: 1) to create in the
              laboratory a new state of matter called "Quark Matter" by heating/ compressing
              normal nuclear matter to a sufficiently high temperature/ density, and, equally
              important, 2) to uniquely determine whether such a transformation to Quark
              Matter has actually taken place. Quark Matter is composed of "free" quarks and
              gluons, the fundamental particles which are bound into protons and neutrons
              which make up normal nuclear matter. It is predicted that the Universe was
              entirely in the Quark Matter state several millionths of a second after the Big
              Bang. The method which we will use to make Quark Matter will be to collide
              beams of heavy nuclei (e.g. lead on lead and gold on gold) moving at speeds
              near the speed of light. These beams will be generated by new state-of-the-art
              particle accelerators located at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island
              and at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. To determine whether Quark Matter has
              actually been created in these high energy heavy ion collisions, large particle
              detectors will be present to detect the secondary particles which are produced
              (mostly pi and K mesons and a range of more exotic particles). Theories predict
              that unique signatures for Quark Matter formation can be extracted from
              information obtained from these secondary particles. The role of the Ohio State
              University group is to participate in developing a new type of particle
              detector for these secondary particles called a "Silicon Drift Detector" and to
              analyze the data which we collect in these experiments to, hopefully, extract
              unique Quark Matter signatures.
