	A long standing problem relating to all tectonics is the lack
              of knowledge of the rates of deformational processes.  This is especially true
              of the rates of folding, about which relatively little is know. The project
              focuses on an area in southern California where active folding is occurring
              near the Pacific shoreline.  Here, the raised beach terraces form permanent
              markers of the paleoshoreline, and when they are dated and their present
              elevations measured, they will reveal the rates of propagation of these folds.
              This project has a high likely hood of success, and will reveal fundamental
              data on the rates of crustal deformation in this active seismic area.
