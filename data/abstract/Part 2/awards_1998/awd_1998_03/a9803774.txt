Abstract    :
              9803774  Model Checking is an automatic verification technique for finite  state
              concurrent systems such as sequential circuit designs and  communication
              protocols. By using special data structures like  Binary Decision Diagrams, it
              is possible to verify properties of  systems with extremely large numbers of
              reachable states.  Although the technique is beginning to be used by companies
              like  Intel, Motorola, and Siemens, additional research is needed to  realize
              the full potential of the method. This project will  develop a number of new
              techniques that should enable larger  hardware systems and certain types of
              software systems such as  security protocols and probabilistic programs to be
              verified. The  new techniques involve extending the partial order reduction to 
              permit symbolic model checking of real-time programs, combining  model checking
              and theorem proving, using program slicing to  reduce the state explosion
              problem in model checking, and  combining abstraction with binary decision
              diagrams.***
