Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study mathematical models that describe 
the
              combined processes of heat conduction and electrical conduction 
in certain
              semiconductors.  Thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity 
are assumed
              to be highly temperature-dependent. Due to the presence of 
strong degeneracy
              and quadratic nonlinearities in the partiual differential 
equations that
              describe these processes, these physical problems lead to 
deep and intriguing
              questions in nonlinear analysis.  Part of the mathematical 
analysis involves
              the applications of partial regularity and the local 
description of a
              solution near a singularity.  However, solutions in these 
processes exhibit
              rich structures and different structures require different 
mathematical
              approaches.

How to control temperature in microprocessors is a very
              important issue 
in the semiconductor industry. The planned research will use
              
mathematical models to reveal how the temperature in a semiconductor
              
depends on the known data. It is expected that the understanding of 
these
              issues can assist engineers and researchers in the design of 
future
              products.
