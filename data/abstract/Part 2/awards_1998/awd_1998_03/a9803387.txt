              Ma       Affiliation:                        Amherst College              This
              grant is jointly awarded through the Separations and Purification         of
              the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and the Condensed        Matter
              Physics Porgram of the Division of Materials Research. The        principal
              investigator is Dr. Jian Ma at Amherst College. The         research project 
              delineates specific studies to develop a set of        experimental and
              modeling tools to characterize porous media. The        project consists of a
              series of adsorption-desorption isohterm and        dynamic measurements on a
              variety of porous materials that have        different intrinsic pore
              geometries and network structures. The        measurements are complemented by
              computer modeling.               Porous materials are ubiquitous and have
              diverse applications in        chemical processes. Despite extensive efforts, a
              comprehensive        understanding of the correlation between pore structure
              and adsorption        behavior has been lacking, due to the complexity of
              porous materials.        Given the significant advancement in statistical
              mechanics and the        tremendous improvement in computing power in the last
              decade, it is        timely to develop a package of experimental/modeling tools
              to        characterize porous solids. Such fundamental understanding will help 
                    improve our ability to design new adsorbents, catalysts, membranes       
              etc., and will impact  the knowledge base in environmental processes.
