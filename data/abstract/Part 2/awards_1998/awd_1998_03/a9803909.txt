Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803909  Lisa  Borghesi    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              molecular  evolution of self/non-self recognition in the invertebrate  chordate
              Botryllus schlosseri. This project aims to  characterize the molecular
              determinants that mediate  self/non-self recognition (allorecognition) in
              Botryllus  schlosseri. Allorecognition systems serve disparate  functions in
              invertebrates, vertebrates and plants, but  allorecognition loci are
              universally marked by extraordinary  levels of polymorphism. Analysis of the
              molecular genetic  basis of allorecognition specificity, in Botryllus may 
              therefore illustrate general principles governing the  evolution of
              individuality in many groups.
