Abstract    :
              Zylstra  9803688    This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Eric Zylstra at
              the University of Tokyo in Japan.  Dr.  Zylstra will work with Dr. Tohru
              Fukuyama, Professor,  Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo
              on a  research project entitled "Enantioselective Total Synthesis  of
              Vinblastine."    The proposed research will provide a direct, efficient route 
              to the antitumor drug vinblastine.  Although this compound  has a long history
              of use in chemotherapy, its structural  complexity hinders the preparation  of
              analogs.  One  commonly chosen synthetic strategy toward vinblastine is the 
              coupling of catharanthine or a catharanthine-like precursor  with the
              structurally-related compound vindoline.  Investigations will be undertaken on
              the usefulness of some  novel palladium methodology for assembling the
              vinblastine  skeleton.  This should lead to development of a more direct, 
              efficient route to its synthesis making it, and structurally  similar analogs,
              more readily available for the preparation  of new, more potent vinblastine
              analogs.  ***
