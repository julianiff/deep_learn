Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803892  Edward M. Driggers    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              directed  evolution of enzymes that accelerate environmentally  important
              reactions.  Enzymes that cleave ether bonds are  being changed into a novel
              enzyme which cleaves methyl-t-  butyl ether (MTBE), an environmental
              contaminant. The  natural substrate is being modified incrementally to 
              resemble the MTBE target, allowing identification of  catalysts that are
              increasingly suited to cleave MTBE from  libraries of the original enzyme.
