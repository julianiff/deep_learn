     This project aims to understand the topology of the
              exterior of a
hyperbolic knot that admits a non-hyperbolic Dehn surgery. 
              More
specifically, what are the hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere that
              admit
Dehn surgeries that are small Seifert fibered spaces or contain
              essential
2-spheres or 2-tori?  The main approach to this problem is to
              understand
when a surface of small genus, either an essential surface or a
              Heegaard
surface, can appear in a Dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot.  The
              residue
of a surface in the Dehn surgery is seen as a punctured surface in
              the
knot exterior.  It is put forth that by looking at the intersections
              of
such a punctured surface with an appropriate planar surface in the
              knot
exterior, one will obtain a good picture of the knot.  Such an
              approach
has been successful in the past at analyzing similar situations.
   
              The structures of 3-dimensional spaces and the classification of knots
are
              beautiful and deep subjects, but they are also important subjects in
extending
              our knowledge in other branches of the sciences.  For example,
some physicists
              now are trying to tie astronomical observations to
structures of 3-dimensional
              spaces in order to determine the shape of the
3-dimensional universe. 
              Microbiologists are beginning to use the concepts
of knot theory to describe
              and understand the knotting of DNA molecules.
Chemists are doing the same to
              understand the knotting and linking of other
molecules.  The Dehn surgery
              construction is an operation on a 3-dimensional
space that produces a new
              3-dimensional space.  This is done by changing
the space around a knotted
              circle in the space.  This project studies how
the space changes according to
              the type of knot along which the change was
made.  The relationship between
              the resulting space and the knot is a
complex one, and its understanding is a
              natural goal for 3-dimensional
topology and knot theory.  A good knowledge of
              this relationship is also a
useful tool for exploring knots and 3-dimensional
              spaces.  Since its
introduction at the turn of the century, the Dehn surgery
              construction has
been a standard way of constructing examples of phenomena in
              3- and
4-dimensional spaces.  It also turns out that many basic questions
              about
knots can be formulated as questions about the Dehn surgery
              construction.
