Abstract    :
              9803035  Hunziker  In 1995, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) initiated
              a series of annual symposia called Frontiers of Engineering.  These meetings
              bring together a select group of the nation's emerging engineering leaders from
              industry, academia, and government labs to discuss pioneering technical work
              and leading edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. 
              The goal of the symposia is to introduce these outstanding engineers to each
              other, and through this interaction facilitate collaboration in engineering,
              the transfer of new techniques and approaches across fields, and establishment
              of contacts among the next generation of engineering leaders.    Three
              Frontiers of Engineering symposia have been held since 1995 during the third
              week of  September at the Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine, California.  NAE
              will conduct a fourth symposium using funds from NSF, possibly supplemented by
              funds from other Federal agencies, which will allow additional person to be
              included.
