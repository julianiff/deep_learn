Abstract    :
              9803656  Spiel    The objective of this project is to further the understanding
              of the basic mechanisms by which aerosols are generated at the surface of the
              sea.  Earlier work in this area identified bursting bubbles as significant
              contributors to the aerosol flux from a disturbed sea surface. "Film" drops are
              produced when the bubble's cap breaks, rolls up into a rapidly advancing
              toroidal ring, and spews off bits of water via centrifugal forces. Jet drops
              are formed at a later stage, after the cap is gone, due to an upward thrust
              from the bottom of the now unstable cavity.   Recent results indicate the
              existence of an entirely new mechanism of sea surface aerosol generation. The
              drops that have been regarded as "film" drops, do not all originate directly
              from the film, but rather most come from splashes created by the impact of the
              film drops on the water's surface near the bubble's edge. These splash-induced
              droplets have been termed "secondary" film droplets, and are the subject of
              this investigation.    In a laboratory experiment, the spectrum of secondary
              film droplets will be measured as a function of bubble size. This requires the
              separation of the primary and secondary droplets. Secondary droplets are
              expected to be much smaller and have initial trajectories which should
              spatially separate the two groups. In a second series of experiments, devices
              will be designed to generate single droplets of a given size with any desired
              speed. Thus, the number of size of secondary droplets can be determined as a
              function of relevant parameters.
