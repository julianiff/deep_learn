This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research
              project between Drs. Mark Ratner, Northwestern University and Vladimiro Mujica,
              Universidad Central de Venezuela, for an experimental/theoretical investigation
              into the behavior of individual molecules bonded at metal surfaces.  The aim of
              the research is to try to solve the problem of how charge is transferred, both
              statically and dynamically, between electrodes and single molecular wire
              structures. To accomplish this, the researchers will prepare hybrid material
              interfaces, characterize them and their behavior using static spectroscopy,
              microscopy, transport measurements, static electronic structure theory and
              direct computation of the dissipative, as well as the superexchange, currents. 
              

The proposed work is of relevance to emerging nanotechnologies.  The
              general area of molecular electronics has been one of substantive interest in
              physical chemistry and materials for a number of years, and with the advent of
              scanning probe and atomic force microscopies it is now possible to study both
              structure and charge transfer on nanometer and subnanometer length scales. The
              collaborators are experienced in the various cross-disciplinary areas necessary
              to carry out this research and bring complementary skills and interest to the
              collaboration.  Most of the experimental work and electronic structure
              calculations will be done at Northwestern, and much of the formal development
              and many body analysis will be done in Caracas.
