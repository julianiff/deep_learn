This project  aims to synthesize and characterize novel
              transitiion metal pnictide and pnictide oxide compounds.  The goals are
              threefold:  to understand and improve on the colossal magnetoresisyance (CMR)
              effect found in materials such as the manganese containing compounds of the
              calcium-aluminum-antimony (Cal4AISbl I) structure type; to synthesize ternary
              transiton metal Zintl phases and study their magnetic and electronic
              properties; and to synthesize new layered pnictide oxides with particular
              emphasis on the copper and titanium containing compounds.  Students will be
              trained in solid state chemical synthesis and characterization
              techniques.

It is expected that these new classes of compounds will
              exhibit interesting magnetic and superconducting behavior for possible use in
              devices.  Examples of technological impact may include colossal
              magnetoresistance materials for magnetic read-head devices, and superconducting
              materials for electronics and communications.
