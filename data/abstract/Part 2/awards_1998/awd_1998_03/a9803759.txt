Abstract    :
              Chu  9803759      This research concerns the design, analysis and performance 
              evaluation of adaptive control algorithms for adaptive  optics applications.
              This investigation could lead to  improved techniques for use in several areas
              of applications,   including ground-based astro-imaging processing, medicine, 
              communications, and laser technology. One specific area  is the deformable
              mirror control computation for adaptive-optics  systems to compensate for
              atmospheric turbulence. The challenges   in this application are that
              atmosphere changes rapidly and that   the statistics of the turbulence usually
              is unknown. The purpose   of this study is threefold: (1) to develop a
              mathematical theory   on how the turbulence statistics can be estimated using
              measured  data, (2) to design a fast algorithm that enables efficient  
              computation in real time, and (3) to integrate the theory and the   algorithm
              into real application facilities.
