Abstract    :
              This project seeks to investigate the nature of possible superconducting states
              of the quasi-one-dimensional organic superconductors based on
              bistetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF)2 X6, of particular interest are X
              being PF6 and Cl04 in high magnetic fields. The PI aims to investigate the
              symmetry of the order parameter and nature of the superconducting state through
              analysis of thermodynamic and transport properties at low and high magnetic
              fields. A focus of the investigation involves the possibility that electrons
              pair in a spin triplet state. %%% This bright young investigator plans basic
              research at the frontiers of condensed matter theory to explore
              superconductivity in a class of materials made of stacks of large organic
              molecules. These materials conduct easily along one direction making them one
              dimensional. The PI will explore the nature of superconducting states in these
              materials, particularly in a large magnetic field, which have the intriguing
              possibility of being qualitatively different from superconductivity in ordinary
              metals.
