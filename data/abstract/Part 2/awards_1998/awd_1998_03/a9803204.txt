Abstract    :
              Miles  Several topics dealing with geophysical fluid dynamics  considered to be
              basic to  the physical understanding of important phenomena in both  the ocean
              and the  atmosphere will be studied using analytical methods. Of  primary
              interest are the  effect of gustiness and parameterization of surface 
              roughness on win to wave  energy transfer, non-linear effects of wave age on
              effective  roughness, wave  propagation in water of variable depth, internal
              vs.  boundary layer damping for  surface waves, and the dissipation of
              barotropic (surface)  tidal energy through  conversion to baroclinic (internal)
              tides.
