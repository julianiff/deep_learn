Abstract    :
                Korzennik, Sylvain  AST-9803423      This award supports the SOHO VI/GONG '98
              Workshop held in Boston, Massachusetts on 1-4 June 1998.   The workshop will
              address a variety of topics in helioseismology, including oscillation mode
              detection and characterization, solar structure and dynamics, mode excitation
              and damping, and theoretical developments.  Some portion of the workshop will
              also address both the status of and the future prospects for detecting
              oscillations in solar-like stars.
