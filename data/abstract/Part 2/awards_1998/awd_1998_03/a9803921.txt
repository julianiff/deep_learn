Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803921  Chi-hua Chiu      This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              evolution of  Hoxa-11 regulation and the fin-limb transition.  The Hoxa-11 
              gene is involved in fish fin and tetrapod limb development.  The evolution of
              Hoxa-11 regulation is being analyzed by  Hoxa-11 nucleotide sequence
              comparisons and gene expression  studies. These studies will provide insights
              into some of  the genetic factors responsible for the fin to limb  transition.
