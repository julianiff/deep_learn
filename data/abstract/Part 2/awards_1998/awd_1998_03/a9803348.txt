Abstract    :
              9803348   Morel                    A special Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in
              Chemical  Oceanography has been planned in May 1998 in Il Ciocco, Italy.   This
              Conference will bring together U.S. and European researchers  in a more
              effective way than has been possible inprevious GRC's.  The sessions have been
              organized on a wide range of topics in which  both European and U.S.
              oceanographers are presently making  important contributions and which
              represent emerging fields as well  as outstanding controversies: Ocean Tracers,
              Marine Bioinorganic  Chemistry, Gas Hydrates, Trace Species-Organic
              Interactions, The  Control of Organic Matter in the Sea, Isotopes
              Fractionation, and  Trace gases.
