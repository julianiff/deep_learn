We propose to study certain problems in geometric analysis,
              including
the asymptotic behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow, the study
              of
certain Ricci flat four-manifolds, and Miyaoka-Yau Inequalities on
closed
              Einstein four-manifolds. For the Kaehler-Ricci flow, we would
like to
              understand the structure of certain gradient Kaehler-Ricci
solitons, which
              arise as limits of dilations of singularities of the
Ricci flow. This has
              important applications in Kaehler geometry and
may lead to new knowledge and
              new insights in the field of geometric
evolution equations. It turns out, as
              our research indicates, that the
study of gradient Ricci solitons has a close
              link to the symplectic
geometry of existence of closed orbits for certain
              special Hamiltonian
vector field. For the second problem, our goal is to
              classify
asymptotically locally Euclidean Ricci-flat four-manifolds
              via
Seiberg-Witten theory. This is related to the generalized positive
action
              conjecture of Hawking and Pope.  For the third problem, note
that a remarkable
              consequence of the existence of a Kaehler-Einstein
metric on a Kaehler surface
              is the Miyaoka-Yau inequality between the
Euler characteristic number and
              signature of the underlying
four-manifold of the Kaehler surface. In this
              proposal we also propose
to study the interesting question whether every
              closed oriented
Einstein four-manifold satisfies the Miyaoka-Yau
              Inequality.

The Ricci flow is an important geometric "heat" equation. In
              general,
heat equations describe the process of changes of tempreature
              of
material to a steady state. The Ricci flow describes changes of
metrics.
              Its "steady state" is an Einstein metric, whose existence is
of fundemental
              importance in geometry, topology, and general
relativity. Our proposal relates
              nonlinear partial differential
equations, differential and complex geometry in
              mathematics, and
gravity, general relativity in physics. A thorough
              understanding of
the problems proposed should advance our knowledge in these
              aspects
and give us new insight.
