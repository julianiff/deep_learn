Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop an efficient scalable
              evolutionary algorithm for search, optimization, and machine learning by
              following the underlying mechanism of the natural process of gene expression
              (DNA -> mRNA -> Protein). This work also applies the developed algorithms to
              solve a distributed data mining problem. The approach consists of: (1)
              abstracting the transcription (DNA -> mRNA), translation (mRNA -> Protein
              sequence), and folding (sequence to 3D folded structure of protein) operations
              in the light of probabilistic and approximate representation construction; (2)
              development of search operators using the developed understanding; and (3)
              incorporation of these mechanisms into an experimental distributed data mining
              system for discovering knowledge from distributed data. A successful completion
              this work will greatly enhance the field of evolutionary adaptive algorithms
              and its applications. It will offer a scalable approach for solving large
              optimization, machine learning, and data mining problems. Moreover, it will
              offer a fundamental understanding of the natural gene expression process from
              the perspective of evolutionary computation.
