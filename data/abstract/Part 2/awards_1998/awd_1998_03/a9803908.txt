Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803908  Amy L. Denton    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
              Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These 
              fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic 
              evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship supports a research and training
              plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training
              plan for this fellowship is entitled the history of  natural selection and
              other evolutionary processes in the  chalcone synthase genes of two grass
              species.  This study  uses coalescent theory to examine evolution at the
              chalcone  synthase (Chs) loci in maize and pearl millet. The relative 
              importance of effective population size, mutation,  recombination and selection
              is being evaluated through  statistical analyses of Chs gene genealogies. The
              primary  goal of the research is to detect the influence of selection  and
              explore the historical forces that have governed  molecular diversity in a
              major plant biosynthetic pathway.
