             A major concern of the active tectonics of
              Cascadia is that of the earthquake cycle.  In general it is considered a quiet
              zone, with little active seismicity.  However, geomorphic studies are now
              showing that earthquakes, probably of large magnitude, have occurred in the
              last 10,000 years.  Their magnitude and distribution are yet to be explored. 
              The project will analyze and date the sedimentary turbidities of the coast of
              Cascadia.  If they can be shown to synchronous over a wide area, then it
              follows that they may have had a common trigger.  The most likely tigger on a
              regional scale is a large earthquake.  Thus this study, if successful, will
              contribute greatly to our understanding of the size and frequency of
              earthquakes in Cascadia, where the modern sesmicity is not very revealing.  The
              nature and partition of strain along the entire convergent margin that will
              emerge from this study will aid in the understanding of deformation
              partitioning and seismic versus aseismic deformation.
