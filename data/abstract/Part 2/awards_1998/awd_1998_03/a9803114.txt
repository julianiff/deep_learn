Abstract    :
              AST- 9803114  Sparke    Most of the mass in galaxies is dark, emitting little or
              no light; we infer the presence only from its gravitational force.  The total
              mass within any radius can be deduced from the speed of gas in a circular orbit
              there; but to find the shape of the dark halo, or how much mass is distributed
              within it, we musst look at orbits in more than one plane, or motion which is
              not symmetric about the center.  Dr. Sparke is studying the relation between
              the observed motions of stars and gas and the mass distribution within
              galaxies.    She is using polar ring systems for part of this work.  In polar
              ring systems, a ring of gas, dust and stars orbits almost at right angles to
              the equatorial plane of the underlying galaxy.  She combines measurements of
              motions in the ring gas, made in the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen, with
              optical nad near-IR images and spectra, to determine the flattening of the
              unseen halo.      She is also conducting a theoretical study of star and gas
              orbits in double-bar potentials.  In many barred galaxies, a small secondary
              nuclear bar can be seen within the larger main bar; probably the figure of the
              central bar rotates more rapidly around the galaxy center than the larger bar. 
                  Another part of this work is the study of how lopsidedness (i.e., the disk
              of the galaxy does not coincide with the center of an unseen halo) might
              persist.  She has a model - gravitational n-body - to follow the gas flow of
              these off-center disks.  ***
