Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803890  Timothy S. Heuer      This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              selection of  protein molecules that bind biologically important small 
              molecules: a study of functional and structural protein  diversity and
              evolution.  Peptides that bind biologically  important molecules (e.g. ATP,
              glutathione) will be selected  from a library of 1013 random sequence
              molecules. Enrichment  of functional peptides occurs by binding the target
              ligand  and selectively amplifying the encoding mRNA, covalently  attached
              during in vitro translation. After many rounds of  selection and amplification,
              emergent peptides will be  characterized and compared to natural motifs.
