Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803946  Jeffrey T. Streelman    This action funds an NSF/Alfred
              P. Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998. 
              These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              DNA simple  sequence repeats as conduits of evolutionary change.  This 
              research seeks to better understand the evolutionary  dynamics of repetitive
              DNA. Using breeding studies,  selection experiments and in vivo RNA assays, the
              hypothesis  that microsatellites modify gene expression in cichlid  fishes is
              being tested. Results will be germane to molecular  evolutionists as well as
              those who use simple sequence  repeats as neutral markers of paternity,
              criminal  identification and population structure.
