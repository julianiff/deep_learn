Abstract    :
              Meeting the requirements of dependable distributed real-time  systems poses
              considerable challenges. Many of the systems to be  built are required to be
              both hard real-time and to use off-the-  shelf commercial hardware and software
              components. The need for  using off-the-shelf components conflicts
              fundamentally with the  classical ``guaranteed response'' hard real-time design
               methodology. The aim of the proposed research is to develop novel  services,
              algorithms and system design methodologies that are  applicable to the design
              of hard real-time distributed systems  built from off-the-shelf components. A
              second goal is to embody  these novel services, algorithms and design
              methodologies into a  prototype distributed fault-tolerant application
              development  environment that would allow hard-real time services and soft-real
               time services to co-exist harmoniously. A third goal is to  investigate means
              for making such systems and services secure to  adverse attacks.  Initially the
              project will focus on continuing  an on-going exploration of the fail-aware
              design paradigm, as a  middle of the road approach between the ``guaranteed
              response''  hard real-time design methodology  and the ``best effort'' soft 
              real time paradigm. More broadly, it is expected that other  aspects of
              specifying, designing, securing and validating  dependable distributed
              real-time systems will be considered.
