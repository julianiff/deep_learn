Abstract    :
              9803598  Wu   The aim of this research is the study of random spatial systems on
              the finite   dimensional hypercubic lattices and  infinite dimensional
              hyperbolic lattices.  Three topics   concerning percolation, Ising
              (ferromagnetic) models, and contact processes will be   studied. The first
              topic concerns percolation and Ising models on hyperbolic lattices.    Although
              Ising models and percolation on the hypercubic lattices have been studied  
              intensively and extensively since they were introduced, these models on
              hyperbolic lattices   have just started to receive attention from physicists
              and mathematicians.  They are found,   by both numerical studies and
              mathematical proofs, to exhibit a phenomenon of multiple   phase transitions. 
              Although a few results have been rigorously proved, many statements   suggested
              by numerical studies are to be proved;  and many more are to be explored.  The 
               second topic concerns a roughening transition of (independent and dependent)
              percolation   on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions larger than or equal
              to three. This is the   analogy of a roughening transition of ferromagnetic
              Ising models. The third topic is about   a phase transition of models with
              low-dimensional inhomogeneity.  These models include   percolation, Ising
              ferromagnetic systems and contact processes.   This research by an investigator
              at an undergraduate institution involves the study   of percolation and
              interacting particle systems. These are probabilistic models, which have   been
              useful in understanding physical systems. Further understanding of these
              probabilistic   models can be helpful to physicists.
