Abstract    :
              The short-term objectives of this research are to design and  evaluate general
              solutions to the problem of inexactness of values  in fault-tolerant systems.
              The long-term goals are to understand  the ways in which inherent redundancy in
               parallel and distributed systems can best be exploited to provide  highly
              dependable multicomputing environments.  Sources of  inexactness include
              round-off error, noise, quantization error,  diverse software, non-determinism,
              heterogeneity, and redundant  sensors.  Inexactness problems include
              approximate agreement,  inexact agreement, clock synchronization, sensor
              fusion, diverse  software, and inexact voting.  In this project, new solution 
              techniques for dealing with inexactness in parallel and  distributed systems
              will be developed, and a unifying methodology  for studying inexactness
              problems will be investigated.  Techniques developed in the project will be
              evaluated  analytically and in a network of workstations testbed.  This 
              research is expected to lead to more efficient and more powerful  techniques
              for dealing with inexactness in fault-tolerant systems.  The effect of these
              techniques will be increased precision of  final results, lower communication
              overhead for redundancy, and  increased overall system reliability.
