Abstract    :
                                                IBN 98-03836  Shihab Shamma, P.I.             
                                                                  This project is a series of
              annual 3-week hands-on workshops  held in Telluride, Colorado.  Neuromorphic
              engineering is a  discipline which reverses the usual thrust of computational 
              neuroscience, orienting itself toward the derivation of  engineered devices
              from an understanding of the design  principles of the nervous system.  In so
              doing, it is having  a unique beneficial effect on neurobiology research. On
              the  one hand, it represents a departure from the usual  engineering principles
              based on linear analog devices or  unabashedly digital ones (e.g. most modern
              computers), and  hence is contributing to development of robots which perform 
              smoothly under highly variable external conditions the way  biological
              organisms do.  On the other hand, it drives  biological research because
              biologists typically cannot  supply (and may tend to avoid) the level of
              quantitative  detail of questioning asked about the way the nervous system  is
              designed.  The workshop involves tutorial-style lectures  on general as well as
              practical topics in neuromorphic  engineering, practical courses on VLSI,
              circuits, "floating  gate" technology; both short and long hands-on projects
              (e.g  building robots with neuromorphic control circuits).  Funding is
              partially supporting travel for faculty and  students for a total of around 60
              persons (faculty,  students, staff).
