               University of Michigan  Project:         Statisitcal Analysis of Longitudinal
              Studies and                    Surveys with Missing Values    Abstract:    Many
              empirical studies have problems with missing data, where subjects   with
              missing values differ systematically from subjects with complete   data.
              Discarding the incomplete cases leads to bias and loss of   efficiency.
              Model-based statistical methods allow for efficient and   valid inferences
              based on all the data, but require careful attention  to correct modeling of
              the data and the missing data mechanism. This  research will develop new
              Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for  handling incomplete data in the
              following problems:  Longitudinal data  where study subjects are measured
              repeatedly over time, and subjects  are missing at certain times, or drop out
              of the study prematurely;  and survey data from complex survey designs where
              subjects have  differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse.    
              Results from many research studies are hard to interpret because of   missing
              data. In an opinion poll some of the randomly chosen subjects   refuse to
              answer some of the questions, and results based on the   respondents may not be
              representative of the population. In clinical   trials some patients may drop
              out of the study because they cannot   tolerate a particular treatment, or
              simply move to a different  location and cannot be traced. Statistical methods
              for analyzing data  with missing values use partial information on
              nonrespondents to  provide more precise and more accurate answers than can be
              obtained  by analyzing only the complete cases.
