The scope of research covers topics in Gromov-Witten theory,
              
Seiberg-Witten equations and almost Hermitian-Einstein equations.  
The
              proposed project is to count the number of holomorphic curves 
on Kahler
              manifolds with elliptic fibration in terms of modular 
forms; study the
              structure of Einstein four manifolds using
Seiberg-Witten equations and the
              geometry of Gieseker 
stable bundles.

The principal investigator study
              equations describing different
geometric objects and properties of their
              moduli spaces.
