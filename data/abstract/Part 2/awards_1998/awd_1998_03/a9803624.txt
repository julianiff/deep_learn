              Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9803624  Principal Investigator:  Jiang-Hua Lu    This
              project is about applications of Poisson geometry to topology and  to Lie
              theory. Specifically, we propose to study equivariant  cohomology of flag
              manifolds using certain Poisson structures on them.  This should also yield
              results on the Lie algebra cohomology of  nilpotent Lie algebras. Partial
              results have already been reported in  a joint paper with Sam Evens in which we
              give Poisson geometrical  interpretation of the Kostant harmonic forms on flag
              manifolds.    Poisson structures arise from physics, the first one being
              written  down by the French mathematician S.D. Poisson in 1809 when studying 
              classical mechanics. Subsequently they were investigated by the  Norwegian
              mathematician S. Lie. Nowadays, it finds applications in  physics, control
              theory, machining automation and robotic  manipulation.
