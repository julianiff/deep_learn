Abstract    :
              This research project addresses a number of problems in applications of
              approximation theory and spline functions. The problems are grouped into four
              broad areas: multivariate approximation, subdivision algorithms and refinement
              equations, shape preserving interpolation and approximation, and harmonic
              finite elements for solving partial differential equations in spherical
              geometry. Understanding of approximation properties of the spline spaces to be
              considered in this research is of fundamental importance in various
              applications, such as the finite element method. While the primary interest
              will be in spaces defined on non-uniform partitions (such as spaces of
              piecewise polynomials on planar and spherical triangulations), a large portion
              of the research will also be devoted to the important special case of
              shift-invariant spaces. 

Some of the obtained theoretical results will be
              applied in the construction of finite elements suitable for solving partial
              differential equations whose domain is the sphere. Examples are the shallow
              water equations, nondivergent barotropic vorticity equation, and
              altimetry-gravimetry equations of physical geodesy. Accurate solutions of those
              equations are of vital importance for modeling and understanding physical
              phenomena such as the motion of the atmosphere, evolution of the Earth's mantle
              and outer core, and the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field.
