Abstract    :
                AST 98-023057  William Junor    Dr. Junor is undertaking a two year program to
              observe and analyze the central regions of the galaxy M87.  He is using
              polarimetry from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and 18cm observations
              from the Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI)  The VLBI programs will link
              to the VLBI satellite and VSOP/HALCA.  This VLBI program is part of
              VSOP/HALCA's Key Science Program.      M87 is the nearest active galaxy with a
              bright core.  Current theories place a supermassive black hole with an orbiting
              accreting disk at the center of M87.  There is a collimated (over five orders
              of magnitude of scale) flow outward from this region.  Dr. Junor is tracking
              the morphological and brightness evolution of the jet.  HST observations have
              indicated that the core of this galaxy may contain a supermassive black hole of
              2 x 109 solar masses.  These radio observations complement the on-going program
              of HST optical monitoring.  M87 is one of the fewer than ten known to have
              optical synchrotron emission.    The program with VLBI polarimetry of the core
              and the jet is the first such program on this key source at this very high
              resolution, and it will investigate both the role of the magnetic field in
              collimating the jet and the magnetic field topology of the jet.  ***
