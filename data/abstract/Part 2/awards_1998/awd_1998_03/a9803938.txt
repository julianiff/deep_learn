Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9803938  Dawn Field    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral Research Fellowship  in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
              fellowships support studies  involving the theoretical, comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental  analyses of biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular data to address broader  evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be carried out in  a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and training plan for this  fellowship is entitled
              adaptive molecular evolution of  a bacterial  pathogen.  Thirteen mutable
              repeats (microsatellites) are embedded within  virulence factors in
              Haemophilus. influenzae. This study tests the  hypothesis that genetic
              variability at these repeats is an important  factor in determining the
              evolutionary success of individual isolates of  this bacterium.  One hundred
              twenty epidemiologically diverse strains of  H. influenzae are being genotyped,
              and rates of mutation determined.
