Abstract    :
                AST 98-0473018      John S. Gallagher        Dr. Gallagher and Dr. Wyse are
              collaborating to study the properties of the stellar populations in faint dwarf
              galaxies.  These galaxies belong to the type of galaxy that contains the most
              members.  A range of quantitative measurements with new generations of
              instruments, at observatories on the ground and in space, now show that even
              when restricted to the superficially similar gas poor dwarf elliptical systems,
              dwarf galaxies have diverse morphologies and star formation histories.  Why
              these dwarfs are so varied is not known.  Does this reflect initial conditions,
              environmental influences, or both?  Extant data suggest that dwarf ellipticals
              prefer dense environments - is this invariably true?  What are the effect on
              the dwarfs, and the implications for disentangling "nature vs. nurture"? 
              Further, the internal dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, measured from
              stellar velocities, leads to an inferred dark matter content easily surpassing,
              in relative terms, that of high surface brightness giant galaxies.  The
              implications of dense dark matter in tiny galaxies are unclear.  Does this mean
              different types of dark matter in different classes of galaxies?  If so, which
              dwarf galaxies, if any, are representative of the building blocks of giant
              galaxies?      The research team is investigating these questions through new
              observations and modeling of gas poor dwarf galaxies.  They use the new
              technology ARC telescope (consortium through Johns Hopkins University) and the
              WIYN 3.5m  telescope (consortium through the University of Wisconsin) to obtain
              spectra and photometry of dwarf galaxies in three clusters of galaxies:  the
              Virgo cluster, the Coma cluster and the Perseus cluster.    ***
