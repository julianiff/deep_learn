     Modular forms and modular invariance have recently appeared
              in many
areas of geometry and topology.  For examples, they showed up in
              the
index theory of loop space; in the computation of Donaldson
              and
Seiberg-Witten invariants; in the counting problems of rational curves
in
              mirror symmetry.  They have also appeared in mathematical physics
and in the
              construction of topological invariants of 3-manifolds.  The
investigator
              considers it very important to study these new phenomena
systematically and to
              find further applications of modular forms and
modular invariance in geometry
              and topology.  Modular invariance
should be the key to the understanding of
              the geometry and topology of
infinite dimensional manifolds, such as loop
              spaces.  The investigator
hopes to combine modular invariance and many
              classical techniques in
geometry and topology to solve several problems in
              geometry and
topology related to modular forms.
     Modular invariance,
              which is called the symmetry of nature by Edward
Witten (I.A.S.), quite often
              arises from mathematical physics, in
particular, from string theory.  It is
              interesting to notice that the
most beautiful mathematical objects in string
              theory always have the
property of modular invariance.  While modular
              invariance already has
some very interesting applications in geometry and
              topology, a deep
and geometric understanding may tell us that modular
              invariance is
also the symmetry between mathematics and physics.
