Abstract    :
              This is the first wave of a multi-wave survey study of the impact of the new
              "covenant marriage" law in Louisiana.  On August 15, 1997, Louisiana made an
              historical change in its domestic relations laws.  Couples wishing to marry
              must now choose between two systems; the traditional form of marriage governed
              by unrestricted access to no-fault divorce, and covenant marriage. A covenant
              marriage requires that a couple first receive premarital counseling about the
              seriousness of the lifetime commitment, the legal obligation to seek marital
              counseling if problems arise, and the restrictive grounds for divorce or legal
              separation. Divorce from a covenant marriage requires proof of receiving
              marital counseling. The grounds for dissolving the covenant marriage are the
              traditional fault grounds: adultery, physical or sexual cruelty to the other
              spouse or the child of either or both, and imprisonment at hard labor for a
              felony, plus separation for a lengthy period. For less serious problems,
              permanent separation is available.    The intent of this law is to make
              marriage a more enduring commitment by requiring premarital and marital
              counseling and by making divorce more difficult. The law is also intended to
              foster public discourse about the institution of marriage by focusing attention
              on the seriousness and enduring nature of it. In time, such public dialogue is
              expected to promote a more sober and considered understanding of the
              commitments and obligations in marriage. This research will evaluate both goals
              through a cross-section survey of Louisiana residents. In so doing, it will
              answer central questions in sociological theories of divorce.
