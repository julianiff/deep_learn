                Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9803253  Principal Investigator:  Tobias Colding   
              The proposed investigation includes research on manifolds with Ricci  
              curvature bounds, function theory and more generally theory of   sections of
              bundles on manifolds.  Finally the proposed research will   include compactness
              and convergence results for minimal surfaces in   three manifolds and their
              possible topological applications.    One of the fundamental problems in
              geometric analysis is to try to   understand the relationship between the
              topology, the geometry, and   the analysis of manifolds.  In the proposed
              research the PI intends to   try to accomplish this in two main cases, the
              first being for   manifolds with Ricci curvature bounds and the second being
              for three   manifolds.
