This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of
              pseudo-
holomorphic curves.  The aim is to develop effective methods
              for
computing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds
              and
enumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The main thrust is
              a
continuing project with E. Ionel on a gluing formula for Gromov
invariants
              under the operation of `symplectic connect sum'.  The idea
is to collapse the
              connect sum to a singular manifold, keeping track
of the holomorphic curves
              along the way.  Parker and Ionel have
already obtained a gluing formula in
              special cases; these imply the
well-known recent formula of Caporaso-Harris. 
              A general gluing
formula should be an effective new tool for computing Gromov
              and
enumerative invariants.  A second part of the project seeks to for
answer
              the following question.  Suppose C is curve that is
J-holomorphic for some
              non-generic J. If one perturbs J to a nearby
generic J', how many
              J'-holomorphic curves are there close to C?
Several well-known problems in
              enumerative geometry, some solved, some
unsolved, reduce to this problem. 
              Parker and Ionel have an approach
based on the `Taubes obstruction bundle' . 
              The last part of the
project suggests using modified Gromov invariants to
              obtain invariants
that count curves which exist only for special classes of
              almost
complex structures.

One of the most basic problems in mathematics is
              to determine the
solutions of a system of polynomial equations, and an
              important first
step toward that goal is to determine the NUMBER of solutions.
               There
is an explicit formula for the number of simultaneous solutions of
              a
set of n polynomials in n variables.  One can then ask for the number
of
              solutions for n polynomials in n-1 variables.  In this case there
is a free
              parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a union of
curves.  How many? 
              This question has been systematically studied for
100 years, but only a few
              special cases were solved.  Then, around
1990, it was realized that these
              problems can be translated into
symplectic geometry, and then tackeled using
              the powerful machinery of
mathematical gauge theory.  (Gauge theory,
              originally part of physics,
has been the focus of many very fruitful
              interactions between
mathematicians and physicists over the past twenty years;
              it includes
Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and String theory). 
              This
`Gromov invariant' approach led quickly to formulas answering some
              of
the original enumerative problems, and there are clear indications
that
              there are more to be discovered.  This project is aimed toward
further
              developing the symplectic gauge theory in order to produce
additional general
              formulas, and to meld these formulas into a
coherent theory.
