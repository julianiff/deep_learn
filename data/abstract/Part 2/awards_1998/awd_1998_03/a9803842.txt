Abstract    :
              The applications that will be implemented on future high-bandwidth  networks of
              processors will be significantly more ambitious than  the current applications
              (which are mostly involved with  transmissions of digital data and images).
              This project attempts  to develop an object-based model of concurrent
              programming for  these applications, that permits the programmer to employ a 
              largely sequential style of programming for concurrent threads.  Concepts
              developed for databases, object-based programming and  reactive systems form
              the basis of this model.  The model is  minimal: no specific communication or
              synchronization mechanism,  except procedure call, is built into this model.
              The traditional  schemes for communication, synchronization, interfaces among 
              processes and accesses to shared memory are encoded by objects.  Concurrency is
              transparent to the programmer; the programmer  believes that the program
              executes in a sequential manner whereas  the implementation employs concurrent
              threads to gain efficiency.  The project plan is to solidify the theoretical
              foundation of the  work, and extend the basis of the model to make it more
              useful in  practice, introducing real time, dynamic object creation, more 
              general forms of parameter passing among object instances, and  recursive calls
              among concurrent threads.
