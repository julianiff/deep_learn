Abstract    :
              9803694  Cochran       Dr. Cochran will investigate two areas.  He will provide
              major  new information about which knotted circles in 3-space are slice  knots,
              i.e., bound embedded 2-disks in the 4-ball, and he will study  invariants of
              3-dimensional manifolds that can be computed  algorithmically (invariants of
              finite type).  As regards the first, in  collaboration with Peter Teichner and
              Kent Orr, he has succeeded in  finding an infinite sequence of geometric
              relations on knots that are  successive approximations to the knots bounding an
              embedded disk in  the 4-ball.  These relations can be expressed in terms of
              both  Freedman-Casson-Whitney towers and the language of surgery theory.  He 
              will investigate algebraic invariants that reflect these relations.  He will
              provide a bridge between surgery theory, the techniques of  Freedman-Casson,
              and the invariants of Casson and Gordon.  He will  also produce the first
              examples of knots that have vanishing  Casson-Gordon invariants but are not
              slice knots.  In the second area,  in collaboration with Paul Melvin, he will
              focus on applications of  their new theory of finite type invariants to
              existing problems about  3-manifolds, and to finding the topological
              significance of specific  new invariants that he has defined from the quantum
              invariants.       Dr. Cochran will study complex new phenomena of the knotting
              and  linking of spatial objects.  The study of the complex  3-dimensional
              geometric "shapes" assumed by (for example) closed  DNA, carbon compounds,
              viruses and proteins is central to several  frontiers of mathematical biology
              and pharmacology.  For example, if  the 3-dimensional structure of a virus is
              known and if a protein can  be found with a complementary shape and chemistry,
              then this protein  can be used as the basis of an anti-viral drug.  Much of
              such research  proceeds in an ad hoc fashion because of our ignorance of the 
              3-dimensional geometry of proteins.  Dr. Cochran will focus on very  new,
              "higher order" knotting phenomena.  He  seeks new geometric and  quantitative
              descriptions of phenomena.  ***
