Abstract    :
              This project concerns the study of multi-frequency oscillations arising in 
              almost periodically forced  oscillators and  self-excited systems. Main
              problems to be considered are the nature of  complicated dynamics resulting
              from the interactions of several frequencies especially when these frequencies
              are close to resonance.  By studying issues such as mean motions of toral flows
              and quasi-periodic bifurcations,  the investigator would like to address the
              important role played by almost automorphic oscillations in these systems. The
              results of this project will have significant applications to electric circuit
              designs of crystal oscillators.

This project is devoted to the study of
              mathematical models of physical systems that present multi-phase oscillations
              (e.g., mechanical devices and electric circuits) or systems that are subjected
              to seasonal variations (e.g., biological oscillators and population models).
              Due to the complexity of these physical systems involving large dimension,
              multi-parameters and many oscillating frequencies, qualitative analysis (with
              help of numerical computations) will be extremely important to guide practical
              designs of the physical systems with respect to the prediction of valuable
              design parameters and the explanation of new oscillatory phenomena etc.  In
              particular, the results of this project will be of a great impact on electric
              circuit designs of crystal oscillators arising in a large variety of
              applications of communication systems.
