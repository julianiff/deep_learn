Abstract    :
                        9803987  Pitluga      The Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum will
              develop and produce a planetarium show for distribution to other planetariums
              and informal learning centers across the United States.  The forty-minute
              planetarium sky show will help audiences build their own experiences upon the
              observations and rich interpretations of astronomical events of the traditional
              Skidi Pawnee.  The sky show will have four major science themes: (1) Pawnee
              observations as the basis for their cosmology; (2) native use of the sky for
              ceremonial and agricultural calendar-keeping; (3) audience familiarity with the
              sky and its cycles; (4) indigenous astronomical and meteorological knowledge as
              systematic scientific knowledge.      Pawnee Indian Skies will help public
              audiences learn how to manipulate star finders to see how stars move in each
              sector of the sky, understand that stars rise and set in predictable directions
              on the horizon, understand the Pawnee ceremonial earthlodge as an astrological
              observatory, and to understand the position of stars, planets, and
              constellations importance to the Pawnee Indians.    This nationally-distributed
              planetarium show is projected to reach 4.8 million people over 5 years.  The
              development of this show will be shaped in consultation with the Pawnee Skidi
              chiefs, tribal educators, artist, musicians and elders.
