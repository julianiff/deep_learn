Abstract    :
              9803634  Prokop  This award is to support the participation of young
              investigators  in the Engineering Foundation conference "Bioartificial Organs: 
              Science, Medicine, and Technology" to be held July 17-22, 1998 in  Banff,
              Canada.    The objective of the meeting is to explore current and emerging 
              approaches to the science and technologies associated with  artificial organs
              and how the different fields of investigation  interact.  It is expected that
              new innovative and proactive  interactions will develop among the three
              specialist groups  participating in the meeting: materials and polymer
              scientists;  bioprocess engineers; medical professionals.  The young 
              scientists to be supported by NSF funds will have an excellent  opportunity to
              engage in such interactions. Persons who receive  support from the award are to
              submit a letter report to the  Division of Bioengineering and Environmental
              System on the  technology(ies) with the greatest potential for the development 
              of bioartificial organs in the next decade.    Publication of a proceedings is
              scheduled within 10 months of the  conference, thereby making the results of
              the conference  available to a large audience.  ***
