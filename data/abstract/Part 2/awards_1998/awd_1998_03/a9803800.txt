Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to study transient events in the dayside magnetosphere by
              comparing theoretical predictions with simultaneous solar wind, magnetospheric,
              and ionospheric observations.  These dayside transient events are believed to
              be the signatures of entry of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere.  The
              ultimate goal is to determine which ground observations can be used for
              remotely monitoring magnetopause interaction processes.
