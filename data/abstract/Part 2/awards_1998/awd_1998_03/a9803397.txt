Abstract    :
              The PI intends to continue his study of uniqueness and stability for certain
              
important inverse problems. The contemporary methods of the theory of
              
partial differential equations will be used. Those include Carleman type
              
estimates, the Fourier integral operators, potential theory, and general
              
functional analytic approach. An emphasis is on inverse problems with
              
local/partial boundary measurements, on increasing stability by isolating
              
ill-posedness in a simple linear transform, on recovery of non-linear
              
equations, and on interaction between inverse problems and optimal 
control
              theory. Based on the theory the PI plans to develop efficient 
numerical
              algorithms for the following important applied inverse 
problems.
      The
              applied focus of the project will be on 
-     the problem of electromagnetic
              detection of the active part of human 
brain
-     identifying a source of
              acoustical noise located on the surface of an 
aircraft cabin from interior
              measurements
-     finding constitutive laws for complicated non-linear
              physical systems, 
including underground flows in porous media and chemical
              reactions
-     reconstruction of the volatility coefficient of options
              trading from 
current market data.
The second problem is of immediate
              importance in designing less noisy 
cars and midsize aircraft. The fourth one
              is about prediction of the future 
state of the very important financial area
              influencing the life of 
contemporary society.
