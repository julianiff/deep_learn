Abstract    :
              Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws arise in many problems where
              the
conservation of physical quantities such a mass, momentum, and energy
              are
modeled. These equations must typically be solved by approximate
              numerical
methods.  Discontinuities in the data and/or solution (e.g. shock
              waves)
cause difficulties in developing accurate and stable methods. 

This
              proposal concerns the development of high-resolution methods and
              their
implementation as software that can be widely used in solving
              problems
that arise in many different fields.  The P.I. has been
              actively
involved in developing the CLAWPACK and AMRCLAW software
              for
multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems.  This software is freely
available
              and allows students and researchers studying a wide range of
phenomena to use
              the technology of high-resolution methods and adaptive
mesh refinement.  This
              software will be further developed and used to
explore a number of particular
              applications in science and
engineering.  One application concerns computing
              acoustic or elastic
waves in heterogeneous media.  Such problems often arise
              in geophysics
and materials science, for example.  Another application is
              to
numerical relativity, where there is interest in simulating
gravitational
              waves that may soon be detectable by astronomers.
This can be accomplished by
              using a hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein
equations.
