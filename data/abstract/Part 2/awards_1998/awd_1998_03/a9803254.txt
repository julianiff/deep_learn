Abstract    :
                9803254  Burghelea       D. Burghelea plans work in topology, geometric
              analysis and  dynamics, based on methods of linear algebra ``a la von Neumann''
              and  on regularized determinants of elliptic operators.  He plans: 1) to 
              attack a number of open problems on L2-invariants, torsion invariants, 
              relation between torsion and dynamics, 2) to develop new mathematical  tools,
              such as the Hodge theory of geometric complexes associated to  Morse-Bott
              functions, Witten-Hellfer-Sjostrand theory with symmetry  and with parameters,
              and 3) to test these new tools against a number  of open problems in geometric
              analysis and spectral geometry.  The  research will shed more light on the
              nature and the power of the L2  invariants and will considerably increase the
              generality of some  successful techniques in geometric analysis and hopefully
              solve some  open problems in topology and spectral geometry.       The above
              work explores the relationship between the shape of a  geometric object (a
              Riemannian manifold), as embodied in its topology  and geometry, and sound, as
              embodied in the spectra of various Laplace  operators associated to it -- think
              in terms of natural frequencies of  vibration.  It also investigates the
              constraints imposed by the shape  and sound on basic qualitative elements of
              dynamics such as closed  trajectories, attractors, repulsors, and saddle
              points.  The methods  used involve unusual quantities introduced by von
              Neumann, like  dimensions that are not integers and volumes of infinitely large
               objects.  The research will investigate the type of additional  information
              about the shape and sound, and about the dynamics on  geometric objects, that
              can be obtained by using these unusual  quantities.  ***
