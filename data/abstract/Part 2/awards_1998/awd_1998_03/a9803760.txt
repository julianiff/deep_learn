Abstract    :
              This workshop addresses the question of how to create a collaborative digital
              library, to disseminate scientific data to a wider audience than those who
              created the data: from local, national, or global collaboration or the entire
              Internet. We bring together case studies (from physics, astronomy and biology),
              with those offering enabling technology, and other information scientists.
              Topics of the workshop include metadata formats, databases, graphical user
              interface (GUI) software, and data exploration software; how a new user can
              quickly and easily learn to use the library; how the new user can reuse
              interaction paradigms learned elsewhere; how to provide a mechanism for users
              to annotate the library and create new metadata. Another main thrust of the
              workshop is the provision of high-performance computing that is connected at
              high bandwidth to the data archive, to provide filtering and data mining
              services. The output from the workshop is a well-disseminated report of its
              conclusions, accessible via Internet, and published in digest form in a
              peer-reviewed journal. This workshop will offer approaches that can provide or
              improve access to scientific data to a wide variety or users, ranging from
              scientists, business and policy decision makers, general public to
              schoolchildren.
