Abstract    :
              9803665  The main objective of this research is to improve and invent 
              techniques for automatic regression testing.  Regression testing,  which is an
              expensive but necessary part of software maintenance,  is used to provide
              confidence that a modification to a program is  correct.  One negative
              consequence of the expense of regression  testing is that maintainers sometimes
              do not perform the tests,  with disastrous results, because they "know" that a
              change is  correct. The initial focus of this research is a series of 
              experiments with a new technique for reducing the cost (and  thereby increasing
              the use) of regression  testing.  The technique, which uses a combination of
              program  slices to extract semantically meaningful parts of a program, 
              produces a program called "differences" that captures the  semantic change
              between a previously tested program and a changed  version of this program; it
              should be more efficient to  test "differences", because it omits unchanged
              computations.  One  goal of this research, which will use C programs, is to
              assist in  the technology transfer of a technique with a rather theoretical 
              basis to industry.  In addition, the experiments should suggest  improvements
              and alternatives for reducing the cost of regression  testing.***
