Abstract    :
                AST 98-03157  Shrinivas Kulkarni    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) were discovered
              nearly three decades ago, but their origin remained mysterious.  Dr. Kulkarni
              is searching to find radio and/or optical counterparts to these objects.  He
              has detected red shifted absorption lines of intergalactic clouds in the
              optical afterglow of the GRB designated GRB 970508.  He also measured the size
              of the radio afterglow and shown the superluminal (appears to move faster than
              the speed of light) expansion.      Based on this work, he now is studying the
              physics of fireballs and also the nature of the host systems for GRBs.  He has
              ready and rapid access to large optical and radio telescopes around the world,
              and is using these to follow up on all well localized bursts reported by
              BeppoSAX (Italian satellite), XTE/ASM (NASA satellite), and HETE-2 (NASA
              satellite due for launch in fall, 1999).  Once a burst is localized, he
              conducts optical imaging observations followed by spectroscopy and radio
              observations of potential candidates.  Once an afterglow candidate is
              identified, he is conducting broadband optical and infrared observations,
              searching for radio transients, spectroscopy of the source.    ***      ***
