This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research
              project on environmental catalysis between Drs. Gustavo Larsen, University of
              Nebraska, Lincoln, and Daniel Resasco, University of Oklahoma, in collaboration
              with Drs. Carlos A. Querini and Jose M. Parera, Instituto de Investigaciones de
              Catalisis y Petroquimica (INCAPE),  Universidad del Litoral,  Argentina.  
              

The research focuses on the development of new catalytic materials, and
              reduction of the emission of particulate carbons from diesel engines.  These
              two areas of research play an  important role in replacing  polluting liquid
              acids currently used in alkylation processes, as well as in reducing the
              primary source of pollution from diesel engines.  Novel experimental
              spectroscopy and kinetic techniques will be used to characterize the catalysts,
              with high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) to be used as a complementary
              characterization tool. The research profits from the US researchers' expertise
              in the area of  strong solid acid catalysis and catalytic reduction and the
              Argentineans' in the area of diesel soot oxidation.
