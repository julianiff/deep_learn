Research under this award will be conducted in the fields
              of
Lorentzian geometry and mathematical relativity.  One of the central
aims
              of the proposed research is to develop new techniques for
studying spacetime
              rigidity phenomena.  The proposed research seeks to
establish maximum
              principles for null hypersurfaces and use these to
obtain splitting
              theorems/rigidity results for spacetimes which
contain null lines.  Problems
              in the theory of black holes are also to
be investigated.  These new
              techniques for studying null hypersurfaces
will make amenable the problem of
              rigorously establishing under
natural regularity assumptions Hawking's black
              hole area theorem.  The
investigator will also continue research on
              topological censorship and
its relationship to the topology of black holes,
              focusing on the
connection between asymptotic structure and black hole
              topology.

In more general terms, this research project is concerned
              with
achieving a better understanding of the structure of the
              spacetime
universe at both the cosmological scale and the scale of
              collapsing
stars.  The aim of spacetime geometry, as to be utilized and
              developed
in this project, is to study the relationship between
              three
fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (which by
              the
Einstein equations is generated by the presence of matter),
              topology
(i.e., the global shape of spacetime) and causal structure (i.e.,
              the
behavior of light cones).  This research has applications to
              general
relativity and gravitation theory.
