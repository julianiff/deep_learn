A program of theoretical investigation into the quantum
              physics of ultracold, trapped alkai gases is initiated.  The three main line of
              investigation concern kinetic evolution and condensation of cooled gases,
              spatio-temporal manifestati0ons of quantum coherence in traps and light
              scattering from non-condensed quantum gases.
