Abstract    :
              9803535  Colon  This study is to investigate how proteins fold, using a
              histidine-containing protein from E. coli as a model system since its
              three-dimensional structure is known. Experiments are designed to determine if
              kinetic intermediates can be detected during the processes of folding and
              unfolding, and whether basic principles can be derived from such information. 
              The strategy will rely on the application of stopped-flow methods combined with
              optical spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis.  The results should be
              fundamental to the understanding of protein structure and design.
