Abstract    :
              9803834  Yeh  This action is to support a two-day workshop in Seattle, March 
              1998, to  discuss global sharing, integration, standardization, and  management
              of  bathymetry and coastal-topography data.    Unlike other ocean-related
              topics, tsunami (seismic sea wave)  analyses  require the integrated data for
              the entire ocean basin, plus dry  coastal  information; for example, from
              10,000 meter deep ocean trenches to  50  meters above sea level. Accurate and
              high-resolution data are  important not  only for numerical simulations, but
              also for other types of  tsunami  research.    Discussion topics will be:
              present status and the data review,  long-term  and ultimate goals for the data
              system, near-future goals,  standardize the  datum of elevation and depth, and
              the coordinates of data points,  and  coordinate with other research groups.
              The topics will be  discussed  regionally prior to the workshop.    It is
              expected that this workshop will lead to improvements in  bathymetry  data,
              thereby leading to significant advancement in tsunami hazard  mitigation.
