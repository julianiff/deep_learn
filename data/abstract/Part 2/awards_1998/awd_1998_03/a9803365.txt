This project develops statistical models for
              automatic image analysis.  The image models developed are defined by
              arbitrarily placing a large number of points, called facets, in a template
              image.  The facet points are organized hierarchically, and are arranged either
              on grids of increasing resolution or determined using more sophisticated
              criteria, e.g., they may be located at local extrema in the scale-space of the
              image.  Object shapes are established by connecting facets in a tree-like
              structure, and then using the shape of the tree in the image template to model
              expected shapes of facet trees in observed images from the class.  Typically,
              thirty to forty thousand facets are positioned within a two-dimensional image
              template, whereas one-quarter to one-half million facets are placed within
              three-dimensional image sets (e.g., magnetic resonance images or positron
              emission tomography images).

Models generated under this proposal facilitate
              computationally efficient high-level analysis of generic images.  These models
              are applicable to a wide range of image modalities, and require only that a
              template image or prototype image be available for the group of images under
              investigation.  Given an image template for the class, derived models can be
              applied with little or no operator intervention to obtain automatic
              segmentation, object identification, and volumetric analysis for available
              image data.
