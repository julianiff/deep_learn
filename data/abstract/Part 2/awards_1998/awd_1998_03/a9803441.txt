The objectives of this project are: (1) to develop
              a systematic 
mathematical procedure by which the quantitative effects of
              
crystallographic texture on the material tensors (e.g., the 
fourth-order
              elasticity tensor, the sixth-order acoustoelastic 
tensor, etc.) of
              weakly-textured polycrystalline solids can 
be fully delineated; (2) to
              develop an acoustoelastic theory 
for using surface acoustic waves in
              nondestructive evaluation 
of residual stress and/or other material parameters
              (e.g., 
elastic constants, texture coefficients, etc.) in thin-film 
coated
              anisotropic solids.  The systematic procedure to be 
developed in the first
              investigation will be based on the 
theory of group representations and the
              theory of invariants. 
The Stroh formalism and, in particular, Barnett and
              Lothe's 
surface impedance method will be used in the second
              study.

Explicit formulae which would result from the first 
investigation
              will bear on all applications involving 
weakly-textured solids (e.g., metal
              forming operations, 
ultrasonic measurement of stress in structural metals)
              where 
delineating effects of texture-induced anisotropy is essential. 
Thin
              films of advanced coating materials, which are increasingly 
sprayed,
              deposited, or grown on substrates to increase their 
resistance to high
              temperatures, corrosion, or abrasive wear, 
often carry residual stresses as a
              by-product of the production 
process.  The second investigation will provide
              a theoretical 
basis for using laser ultrasonics and acoustic microscopy to
              
obtain information on surface stress for quality control
of thin-film
              coatings.
