Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803894  Daniel W. Seufert    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              genes involved  in tail development in marine invertebrates.  The role of 
              these genes is also being studied in the evolution of  tailless development in
              multiple species.  The evolution of  direct development of  the tail is being
              examined in  molgulid ascidians. Interspecific crosses among two direct- 
              developing and one indirectdeveloping species is being used  as a
              "complementation analysis" for rescue of larval  features. Additionally,
              expression of Manx and bobcat is  being analyzed in several species to
              determine whether loss  of gene function is important in loss of larval
              chordate  features.
