Abstract    :
              This work involves a uniting of investigations in stability theory, model theory
              of algebra, and finite model theory.  One underlying technique is the
              construction of homogeneous universal models with respect to a notion of strong
              submodel.  On the one hand, this links stability theory with probability on
              finite models by providing a technique for not only proving 0-1 laws but
              obtaining model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory.  These model
              theoretic properties of the almost sure theory can be applied to problems in
              finite model theory.  On the other hand, this technique is exploited to attempt
              to construct a bad field.  Finally, investigations of embedded finite models
              solves problems of database database theory using techniques from stability
              theory.     One theme in this work is model theory, a branch of mathematical
              logic.  The general aim is to understand `ordinary mathematics' at a higher
              level of abstraction.  This has previously resulted in applications in the area
              of algebra, specifically group theory.  The present project will involve an
              attempt to find some specific new structures which expand the complex numbers. 
              Some of these same insights will be used to explore the asymptotic properties
              of finite graphs.  A further application of this abstract framework has been in
              the development of `embedded finite model theory,' where the techniques of
              model theory are employed to find limits on the expressibility of database
              queries.
