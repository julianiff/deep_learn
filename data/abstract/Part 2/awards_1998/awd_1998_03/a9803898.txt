Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803898  Carolyn J. Ferguson    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation. These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              using gene  genealogies to assess effects of hybridization between  species of
              Phlox plants in the Ozarks.  The goal of this  research is to evaluate the
              hypothesis that hybridization  between closely related Phlox species has
              resulted in the  populations recognized as Phlox pilosa ssp. ozarkana. 
              Sequence data from variable, low-copy regions of the nuclear  genome are being
              used for a phylogeographic analysis of  hybridization and introgression.
