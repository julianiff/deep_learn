Abstract    :
              9803843  This project investigates formal methods for programming object- 
              oriented (OO) software components. The goals are to produce: (a)  theoretical
              foundations to support careful reasoning about such  components, and (b)
              expressive behavioral interface specification  languages (BISLs) that are able
              to substitute for the source code  of such components. Foundational issues for
              goal (a) include the  model theory and proof theory of abstract data types with
              mutable  objects, subtyping, aliasing, and message passing. The model  theory
              of our previous work is extended to account for  nondeterminism and
              higher-order procedures. In proof theory,  equational reasoning techniques for
              reasoning about immutable  objects are sought. These results are to be
              connected with  verification logics for OO languages with the new feature of 
              multimethods. Goal (b) helps vendors explain OO class libraries  and frameworks
              to customers without giving them source code,  which cannot be done with
              existing BISLs. This project provides:  guidance for the design of more
              expressive OO specification  languages, ideas for use in documentation of OO
              class libraries  and frameworks, and expressive notations for specification. 
              Software engineers will also benefit from more expressive BISLs  and the ideas
              about reasoning.***
