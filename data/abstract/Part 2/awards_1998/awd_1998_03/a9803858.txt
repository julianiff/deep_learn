Abstract    :
              9803858  Frair    This project is the holding of a national symposium on the
              best practices in the assessment and evaluation of engineering education.   
              This symposium is the second of its kind, following a successful one held in
              the Spring of 1997 on the campus of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in
              Terre Haute, IN.    Assessment techniques are required to be used in the
              evaluation of engineering education activities to see if they warrant being
              accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
              under the new accrediting activities of that body which are being introduced in
              stages up to full use at all US engineering colleges.
