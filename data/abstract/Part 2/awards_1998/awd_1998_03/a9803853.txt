Abstract    :
              9803853  Information Theory-Based Measurement of Software Designs is a  research
              project that is defining and validating a new generation  of software design
              metrics, based on information theory, which in  turn, will facilitate a new
              level of cost- effective improvement  to software quality. This project is
              developing metrics of  cohesion and coupling on abstractions of software that
              are  created during high-level design, so that quality problems may be 
              detected early in the life cycle. Since many design abstractions  are
              represented by graphs, metrics of graph attributes will  likely find broad
              application. Many traditional software metrics  count features, as if all items
              were equally important in the  design process. Information theory is an
              alternative approach  that focuses on the amount of information in an
              attribute, rather  than a count. This project is establishing a new generation
              of  information theory-based software design metrics by definition  and
              empirical validation of metrics for cohesion and coupling.  Collaboration with
              a large telecommunications equipment  manufacturer is providing the basis for
              credible case studies,  where the system studied is being developed by a group
              of  professionals in an industrial environment, and is large enough  to be
              comparable to other industry projects.***
