Abstract    :
              This project will continue to develop and support a communications
              infrastructure for the Geospace Environment Modeling Program.  This includes
              comunications through an electronic newsletter, a regularly mailed newsletter,
              and support of a WEB page linked to past issues of the newsletters, reports,
              meeting information, on-line poster sessions to support meetings and workshops,
              database support with access to interplanetary and solar wind data, and
              proposed to include information from and about the GGCM campaign.
