Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9803175  O'Connell/U. Virginia    The International Conferences on
              Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design are held every
              three years, presently alternating between North America and Europe.  The first
              seven conferences have produced highly desirable interactions between academic
              and industrial and government workers in this vital area for chemical process
              design and simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important
              gatherings for workers from all over the world; the Seventh Conference held in
              1995 in Snowmass CO USA attracted 238 participants from 22 countries.  Each
              conference has produced important collections of papers in Proceedings volumes.
               The Seventh Conference provided almost 1000 pages of reviews and new research
              when published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.     The
              Eighth Conference is schedule for April 26-May 1, 1998 in Noordwijerhout, The
              Netherlands, with much of the same successful format as for the previous
              conference but, as the name change reveals, includes some significant
              enhancements toward consideration of products as well as processes and
              education.    The present proposal requests funds for travel, meals and lodging
              for up to 25 needy US academic researchers to reach the conference site as well
              as communication cost.  Those supported would include 12 presenters of papers
              with the rest being young research workers who would not be able to attend
              without such support.  No request is made for meeting organization expenses or
              for non US participants.   ***
