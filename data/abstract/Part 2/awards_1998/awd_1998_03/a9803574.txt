Abstract    :
              9803574  Li   The objectives of this research are to study the properties of
              stochastic processes   together with the topological and geometrical properties
              of the underlying spaces, and    applications of the theory of diffusion
              processes. Both finite  and infinite dimensional    manifolds are to be
              considered (in particular path and loop spaces of Riemannian   manifolds).  
              Investigations will concentrate on the following problems:  the existence of a 
               (smooth) solution flow to stochastic differential equations,  asymptotics of
              stochastic   dynamical systems (including  moment estimates, almost sure
              estimates,   recurrence/transience, and stable manifold theory) and integration
              by parts formulae in   various situations. Special attention will be paid to
              the dynamics and geometry of   Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise.
              The study of backward stochastic   differential equations and stochastic
              differential equations driven by space-time   martingales will also be
              included.   The investigator shall continue her research in stochastic
              dynamical systems and   related topics. The asymptotics,  analytical properties
               and geometrical properties of    solutions of stochastic differential
              equations are to be studied together  with the  geometry   and topology of the
              underlying spaces. Particular examples of  stochastic differential   equations
              including Hamiltonian systems  perturbed by white noise shall be investigated.
