              Message Contents -------------------------------  Abbas Bahri    This proposal
              aims at studying various variational problems in Partial   Differential
              Equations and contact form geometry.  These problems are   connected to the
              study of changing sign solutions for Yamabe type   problems as well as the
              study of Yang-Mills and Einstein equations.   They are also connected to the
              finding of periodic orbits for contact   vector fields.  There is finally some
              relation to quantum mechanics.   The tools are extracted from partial
              differential equations, geometry   and variational theory.  \medskip    There
              are in Physics several open problems regarding the shape and the   behavior of
              the universe as well as the behavior of its elementary   particles.  Using
              these tools from mathematics, variational theory and   its extensions in
              particular, we are trying to give some contribution   to the understanding of
              these problems, which have an independent   mathematical interest.
