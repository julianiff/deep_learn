Abstract    :
              9803344  Mason   Large sample problems in probability and statistics concern
              what happens to   processes or statistics when the sample size increases to
              infinity. The investigator plans to    work in three areas in which such
              problems naturally arise. These are the following: 1.   self-normalized sums,
              2. generalized extremes, and 3. weighted  approximations.  The   problems in
              area 1 originate from the long standing question concerning the possible  
              asymptotic distributions of the classical Student's t-statistic. Those in area
              2 stem from   questions about the limiting distribution of extreme values, such
              as annual maximum   temperatures, river heights and largest incomes in a
              population. He generalizes the notion   of extremes to a multivariate setting
              and proposes to study its large sample properties.   Finally in area 3, he
              intends to look  into methods of approximating finite sample   processes that
              arise from testing for dependence in data by an asymptotic process. This  
              should provide a useful tool to determine the limiting distribution of many
              functionals of   such finite sample processes.   Solutions to problems in all
              three areas of research should have numerous   applications in statistical
              inference and estimation, especially in multivariate and dependent  
              situations, whenever large samples are available. Eventually, it is hoped that
              many of the   results will lead to the construction of data analytic tools
              which will enter into the   everyday practice of statistics. In any case they
              should improve our understanding of an   interesting range of random behavior.
