Abstract    :
                9803861  Levin    Extreme concentrations of resources (low oxygen, high food) 
              for benthic organisms occur in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs),  technically
              defined as regions where oxygen concentrations  fall below 0.5 ml/1.  Midwater
              oxygen minima are strongly  developed in the eastern Pacific Ocean and
              intercept much of  the continental margin along the Americas.  This is also a 
              region of the world ocean where hydrography and the  intensity of the OMZ are
              heavily affected by interdecadal  climate change such as ENSO.  We propose a
              multidisciplinary  investigation of sediment geochemistry, bioturbation, 
              bacteria, foraminifera, metazoans, and fish scales in  sediments within and
              beneath the OMZ.  These components are  strongly affected by oxygenation level,
              which varies  significantly during, E1 Ni o and La Ni a conditions.  This 
              proposal requests seed funds for a program to test  hypotheses about oxygen
              minimum zone influence on benthic  shelf and slope communities off Peru and
              Chile, and the  extent to which E1 Ni o-related events modify benthic 
              community processes.  Results will be compared to ongoing  studies of benthic
              processes in other low oxygen settings  (OMZs and methane seeps) off Mexico,
              California and Oregon.  This effort will advance understanding of relationships
               among abiotic factors and benthic processes that are  critical to accurate
              evaluations of modern and ancient  (paleo-) environments, natural population
              cycles and  management of coastal marine resources.  The program will  involve
              participation of US (Scripps), Chilean (University  de Concepcion), and
              Peruvian (IMARPE) scientists.
