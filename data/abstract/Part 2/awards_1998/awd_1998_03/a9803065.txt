Abstract    :
              AST 98-03065  James M. Jackson    Dr. Jackson and Dr. Bania are observing three
              galaxies that belong to the Milky Way Local Group of galaxies:  the Large
              Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and IC 10.  The Local
              Group has about 30 member galaxies in it.  The Milky Way and the Andromeda
              Galaxy are the two large galaxy members of the Local Group.  The other galaxies
              are dwarf ellipticals or irregulars.  The LMC and the SMC are two irregular
              galaxies that show evidence of a past interaction with the Milky Way.  The
              galaxy IC 10 is a nearby dwarf elliptical galaxy.     The LMC and SMC are
              southern hemisphere objects.  IC 10 is a northern hemisphere galaxy.  Dwarf
              galaxies such as these three form useful analogs to the conditions found in
              early galaxies.  Early galaxies have low metallicities as well as star forming
              regions, just as the dwarfs do.  Dwarf galaxies have the advantage that many
              are relatively close.  The PI's can, therefore, use these observations from
              nearby dwarf galaxies to build a template to use for primordial star formation
              (PSF) studies.    Dense molecular gas is a crucial element in the formation of
              stars.  This gas provides the raw fuel for new star formation.  Such dense gas
              has been difficult to observe in the past and only the brightest of the
              molecular lines had been measured.  These lines are found in the submillimeter
              and millimeter part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Now with improved
              millimeter and submillimeter wavelength receivers and telescopes the PI's
              observe and map several new molecular emission lines, especially the mid J CO
              lines and the C I lines.   The new Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote
              Observatory (AST/RO) is ideal for studies in the submillimeter part of the
              electromagnetic spectrum.  This project is part of an Observatory Key Project
              to survey the Magellanic Clouds. The PI's also use the James Clark Maxwell
              Telescope (JCMT) for IC 10 which is a northern hemisphere galaxy.  In addition,
              they use data from the Infrared  Satellite Observatory (ISO) to complete a set
              of diagnostics.  ***
