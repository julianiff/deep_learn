Abstract    :
              9803746  Peirce  The objective of this project is to determine the significance
              of nitric oxide flux from sludge-amended soils under conditions that simulate
              field application that will assist in establishing engineering design
              limitations of aggressive use of soil for management of sludges derived from
              treatment of domestic wastewater.  Nitrogenous substances applied to soil from
              all sources including chemical fertilizers are subject to physical, chemical
              and biological processes that indirectly or directly affect their transport and
              alter their physical state.  The application of residual sludges to
              agricultural soil may significantly impact the microbial production of nitrogen
              oxides, the production of which may adversely impact local and regional air
              quality.  Soils to be investigated in the laboratory will be obtained from
              agricultural land comparable to that currently being used for land application
              of sludge.  Sludge will be obtained from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina
              wastewater treatment plant.  Recently emphasis on aggressive use of land for
              sludge management suggests determining whether knowledge currently available
              regarding the nitrogen oxide emission characteristics from these soils and
              their role in contribution to formation of atomospheric ozone is sufficient to
              establish engineering design parameters for this management concept.  In this
              renewal of exploratory research initiated under NSF Grant No. 9727886,
              laboratory studies at Duke University will be used to guide field studies
              conducted in cooperation with North Carolina State University co-investigators
              Dr. Viney P. Aneja, Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and
              Dr. Wayne P. Robarge, Department of Soil Science.  Results of laboratory
              experiments will be compared with those from field studies to determine the
              scope of additional research needed to relate existing knowledge of the flux of
              reactive nitrogen oxide from natural and chemically fertilized soils to soils
              that are used for sludge management.  ***
