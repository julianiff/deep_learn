Hedin
The efficient detection of muons in collider experiments is
              challenging, but crucial to the verification of the theory known as the
              Standard Model and the discovery of new phenomena.  This group's expertise is
              in muon detection, as applied in the D0 experiment upgrade at Fermilab and in
              the US ATLAS detector construction project.
