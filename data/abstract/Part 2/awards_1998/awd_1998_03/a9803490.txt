The main goal of the proposed research is to further
              develop the linear
programming approach to optimal stochastic control and to
              make this
solution technique applicable to all types of stochastic control
              
problems, including stopping time problems, impulse control, singular
              
control and adaptive control problems.  This approach will also be used 
to
              analyze complex models in areas as diverse as mathematical finance and
quality
              control.

A major benefit of the LP approach is that it naturally lends
              itself
to numerical methods.  Two approaches will be pursued: a discretization
              
technique and the method of moments.  A significant part of the grant 
will
              be devoted to implementing and testing numerical schemes using 
linear
              programming software to compute optimal controls.
