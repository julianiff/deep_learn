     The investigator studies the relationship between curvature
              and
the topology of manifolds.  In particular, he continues his
              work
concerning the existence and the classification (up to concordance)
              of
metrics of positive scalar curvature.  Some of his earlier work shows
that
              these questions boil down to determining an abelian group R that
depends only
              on the dimension of the manifold M under consideration,
its fundamental group,
              and its first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes
(e.g., this group acts freely
              and a transitively on the set of positive
scalar curvature metrics on M).  The
              role of R is reminiscent of the role
of Wall's surgery obstruction group in
              the classification of manifolds up
to diffeomorphisms.  The investigator hopes
              to show that a periodic
version of R contains as a direct summand the K-Theory
              of a C*-algebra
associated to the data.  He hopes to find invariants for the
              `non-periodic'
part of R by exploiting the minimal hypersurface method for
              studying
positive scalar curvature metrics.  Concerning other types of
              curvature,
the investigator is pursuing his conjecture that the existence of
              a
metric of positive Ricci curvature on a spin manifold M with
              vanishing
first Pontryagin class implies that the Witten genus of M is zero. 
              He
hopes to prove this conjecture by constructing a Dirac type operator
              on
the free loop space of M and analysing its Weitzenbock formula.
    
              Relating geometric features of a manifold M to its topology is the
central
              problem in global geometry.  Here `geometric' refers to
quantitative features
              of the manifold; e.g., the scalar curvature that
associates a real number s(x)
              to any point x in M; this number is a
measure for how the volume of small
              balls around x compares to the
volume of a ball of the same radius in
              Euclidean space.  The `topology'
of M captures the qualitative features (like
              the number of holes);
these don't change when M is `deformed' (think of
              squeezing a balloon).
Often, as in the case of scalar curvature, the basic
              connection between
the geometry and the topology of a manifold is made by
              studying
differential equations on M.  It is an exciting possibility that
              new
relations between the geometry and the topology of M might be obtained
by
              studying similar differential equations on the infinite dimensional
space of
              loops in M; this makes contact with stochastic analysis and
with physics
              (`string theory').
