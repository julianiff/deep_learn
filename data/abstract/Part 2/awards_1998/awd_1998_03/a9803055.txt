Abstract    :
              ECS-9803055  Pai    Stability of large scale systems with model reduction is
              going to be important in the emerging new structure of power systems.  Faster
              and reliable tools for computing dynamic available transfer capabilities (DATC)
              will be needed.  This proposal addresses three aspects which will impact this
              area.    Firstly, trajectory sensitivities which have yielded reliable results
              for dynamic security assessment (DSA) based on post-fault systems only, will
              now be extended to cover both faulted and post-fault dynamics.  This will imply
              formulating dynamic sensitivity functions for systems of differential algebraic
              equations with discontinuities in the algebraic portion.  This will enable the
              direct computation of sensitivities to critical clearing time as well to
              changes in load, tap settings, etc.    A second objective is to find better and
              robust preconditioners for solving large sparse systems of the type Ax = b by
              iterative methods.  This will then be used as part of the fast dynamic
              simulation algorithm using the simultaneous implicit method.    Finally two new
              approaches to model reduction will be taken.  First, we will use trajectory
              sensitivities of the nonlinear dynamic response to identify coherent
              generators.  To date only linearized models around an operating point have been
              used for coherency grouping or some other heuristic criteria.  Secondly, we
              will use the Krylov projector technique to develop reduced order dynamic
              models.  This is a recently developed tool in numerical linear algebra for DAE
              systems.
