              DMS-9803764  Title: Midwest Conferences on Partial Differential Equations   
              This proposal requests partial support for a series of six conferences on the
              subject of Partial Differential Equations to be held twice a year during the
              three-year period that starts on June 1, 1998. It is a continuation of a
              successful series of such meetings, which were partially supported by the
              National Science Foundation. Partial Differential Equations is one of the
              subjects in Analysis where substantial progress is taking place and new
              mathematical ideas are being introduced at a fast pace. PDE keeps providing
              answers to a manifold of problems arising both in mathematics as well as its
              applications. These meetings are expected to be very valuable in disseminating
              the new ideas and problems not only among the experts but also to the general
              community, especially to young mathematicians and graduate students.
