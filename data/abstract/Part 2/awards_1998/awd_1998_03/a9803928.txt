Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9803928  Christopher Burge    This action funds an NSF/Alfred P.
              Sloan Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1998.  These
               fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative,
              computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic
              evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of
              molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship
              supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring
              laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              evolution of  sequences involved in RNA splicing.  The research has two  goals:
                first, to develop and apply new computational  methods for analyzing the
              functional constraints on a DNA or  RNA signal sequence such as the 5' splice
              signal or branch  point signal involved in pre-mRNA splicing and second, to 
              search available intron and exon sequences for novel repeat  type signals
              involved in regulation of altemative splicing.
