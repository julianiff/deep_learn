This award supports a conference on "Algorithmic Problems in
              Groups and Semigroups "
at the University of Nebraska. The conference will
              consist of twenty lectures  and selected
short contributions. Efforts are
              being made to include graduate students and young investigators .

The field
              of algorithmic group theory is an interface area between group
              theory---the
mathematical study of symmetry---and computation. The study of
              such algorithms in
groups will  lead to a better understanding of "complexity
              of computation."
