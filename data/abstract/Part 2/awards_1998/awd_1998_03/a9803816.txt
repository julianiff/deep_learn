Abstract    :
              This project seeks to find a surface source of noise in an
aircraft from
              measurements of the acoustical pressure inside of
the cabin.  These
              measurements are available from experiments.
The PIs will make use of integral
              equations of the potential
theory for the Helmholtz equation combined with
              contemporary
theory of inverse problems and recent advances in
              numerical
analysis including rapid computations of potential type
              integrals
and solution of linear algebraic systems of Toeplitz structure.
The
              problem of reducing noise in (midsize) aircraft is of extreme
importance and a
              part of it is to find a source of the noise.
This project assumes a strong
              interaction with aviation industry.
One outcome of this work will be the
              delivery of a computer code
to Cessna Aircraft Company.  However, the results
              are expected to
be of value also for car industry and for the U.S.Navy. 
              The
graduate students will be seriously involved into theoretical
              and
numerical on the project preparing for future work in industry.
