Abstract    :
                AST 98-03199  August Evrard    The formation of galaxies is a complex problem
              central to observational cosmology.  The problem involves solving for the fluid
              dynamic and thermodynamic behavior of a set of fluids (dark matter, baryonic
              gas, and stars) coupled in a highly non-linear manner over a wide dynamic range
              in physical scales.  Numerical simulations provide a means to address this
              problem.  The PI is modeling the parameter space associated with numerical
              simulations of galaxy formation in groups and clusters.  He is using two
              independent codes:  the P3MSPH code developed by the PI, and the Virgo
              consortium's Hydra code  These both run on parallel machines.  The science
              objectives of the project are (1) what aspects of modeled clusters are
              numerically robust? (2) what processes determine the relative fractions of
              baryons in galaxies and the intracluster medium? (3) can a single model for
              galaxy formation reproduce the observed optical and x-ray characteristics of
              groups and clusters?  (4) how do galaxies trace the total mass in clustered
              environments?  This is a phased study to (1) investigate stability to numerical
              parameters, (2) to calibrate response to star formation and feedback
              prescriptions, (3) explore dependence across a spectrum of cluster sizes, (4)
              explore sensitivity to the cosmological model.  ***
