                 The general goal of this research proposal is to get a deeper  understanding
              of the global geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional  Euclidean space.  One
              goal is to understand the topology, asymptotic  geometry and conformal
              structure of properly embedded minimal  surfaces.  A second important goal is
              to apply these results to  understand the convergence of bounded genus minimal
              surfaces in  three-manifolds.    The field of minimal surfaces has its roots
              based on geometric studies  by the major mathematicians of the previous
              century.  However, the new  analytic and geometric techniques developed in the
              past twenty years  have made the theory of minimal surfaces an essential
              research tool in  other fields.  These fields include Topology, Algebraic
              Geometry,  geometry of black holes and elementary particle Physics.  I propose
              to  characterize how these infinite surfaces behave geometrically and to 
              classify them.  Recently certain examples of these surfaces were used  to model
              interfaces in coblock polymers and one of my classification  results shows that
              these are the only possible examples.  The primary  goal of this proposal is to
              prove some beautiful conjectures  concerning these surfaces, whose solutions
              will have important  applications to other parts of Mathematics and Science.
