Main goal of this proposal is the experimental study of
              proton and alpha induced reactions important for the understanding of
              nucleosynthesis in hydrogen and helium shell burning during the late stages of
              stellar evolution.  The proposed measurements are necessary for a better
              understanding of nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch
              (AGB) stars.  AGB stars can form planetary nebula by expulsion of the outer
              envelope and contribute therefore strongly to the abundances observed in
              interstellar and meteoritic material.  The proposed experiments will be
              performed at the newly installed KN (and JN) Van de Graaff accelerator facility
              at the University of Notre Dame using primarily low energy proton and alpha
              beams.  For some of the proposed experiments inverse kinematic techniques will
              be used.  The energy range available corresponds to the Gamow range of burning
              in late stellar evolution.
