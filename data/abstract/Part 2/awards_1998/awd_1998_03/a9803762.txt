Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to increase our understanding of the amounts,
              vertical distribution, transport, and chemical interactivity of nitrogen oxides
              (NOx) produced by lightning in the troposphere.  The tool to be used in this
              investigation is the three-dimensional Storm Electrification Model (SEM) that
              incorporates a lightning parameterization scheme that is based on physical
              principles and minimizes the use of arbitrary parameters.  The key feature of
              the parameterization is the calculation of the energy dissipation by the
              lightning flash, which is a primary factor in determination of the amount of NO
              that a flash produces.  The model calculates the amount of NO produced along
              each simulated lightning channel and then distributes it according to the
              time-evolving flow field while chemically reacting with the other species
              included in the simulation. 

The main objectives of this work are to perform
              detailed NOx budget studies, to examine the difference between daytime and
              nighttime NOx chemistry as it may affect global and regional models, to use the
              energy-based scheme for calculating NOx and to compare the NO produced by
              cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning, to examine the time evolution of the
              altitude distribution of NO produced by lightning to provide more accurate
              information for global models, to simulate storms from New Mexico (clean
              boundary layer) and Colorado (dirty boundary layer), where detailed
              observations have been obtained, to compare model results to the
              observations.
