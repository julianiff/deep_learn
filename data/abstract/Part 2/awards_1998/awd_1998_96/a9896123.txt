Abstract    :
              Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) is of fundamental  importance in
              geometric computing, graphics, visualization,  robotics, and other disciplines.
               This project is to develop  Physics-Based CAGD, a new interdisciplinary
              paradigm which  marries geometric modeling with computational physics.  The 
              objective of this project is to dramatically enhance the CAGD  process by
              creating advanced parametric and implicit geometric  models with highly
              intuitive behaviors that are governed by  physical principles. This project
              takes the following three-fold  approach to achieve its goal: (1) Continue the
              research endeavor  on Dynamic Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (D-NURBS); (2)
              Explore  and devise novel physics-based modeling techniques and algorithms 
              based on powerful new representations, including subdivision  wavelets,
              manifold splines, and implicit functions; and (3)  Exploit the theoretical
              advances of the earlier stages of this  project to develop an extensive set of
              efficient algorithms and  interactive software routines of Physics-Based CAGD
              for a wide  range of applications. This project is further augmented by the 
              following educational initiatives: (1) Develop new graduate and  undergraduate
              courses; (2) Write a textbook on Physics-Based  CAGD; (3) Promote and
              participate in interdisciplinary research  and education projects; (4) Produce
              highly trained personnel by  supervising graduate students, directing senior
              projects of  undergraduate students, participating in outreach and mentoring 
              programs, etc; and (5) Promote the rapid dissemination of Physics-  Based CAGD
              technology to national enterprise through  collaboration with the CAGD
              industry.    The results of this project will yield highly interactive CAGD 
              techniques. Furthermore, these research and education advances  will
              demonstrate that Physics-Based CAGD can serve as a unified  basis for various
              traditional design techniques.
