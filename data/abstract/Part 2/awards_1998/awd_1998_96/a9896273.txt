Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9618190    A model of the gas-phase chemistry relevant to silane
              (SiH4) combustion is developed.  An elementary chemical mechanism describing
              the silicon/hydrogen/oxygen system is generated.  The model is verified by
              comparison with existing experimental data and by an  experimental study of
              silica (SiO2) formation in a laboratory-scale synthesis flame.    Large
              quantities of silane fuels are used to provide silica for the fabrication of
              microchips and fiber optics.  These applications require high-purity,
              low-defect material; meeting these requirements demands knowledge of the
              detailed gas-phase chemistry leading to formation of silica.
