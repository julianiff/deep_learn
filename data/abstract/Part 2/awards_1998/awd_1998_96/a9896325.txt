Abstract    :
                This research is concerned with understanding the impact of redistricting on
              legislative elections.  The standard wisdom holds that redistricting has only a
              minimal effect on elections; producing tiny changes in partisan gain or doing
              little to protect incumbents.  While a great deal of research has been
              undertaken on this problem, the researchers argue that previous work has
              improperly modeled the effects.  Using a formal model of strategic
              redistricting, the PIs show that a variety of actors, ranging from state
              legislators to state judges have important effects on how redistricting lines
              are drawn.  While this is well known, they also show the conditions under when
              their strategic behavior will have an impact on partisan gains and incumbent
              advantage.  The researchers test crucial features of their model by examining
              the array of redistricting changes that occurred in the 1960's.  This was a key
              period in American politics and has often been associated with the rise of an
              incumbency advantage.  The researchers find that redistricting is an important
              strategic tool to change partisan advantage and to protect incumbents.
