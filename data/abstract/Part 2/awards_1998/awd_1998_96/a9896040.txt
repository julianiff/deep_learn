Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a scaleable fault  tolerance framework
              that can be customized to economically cover  a wide range of fault models,
              applications, and computational  environments.  The system is based on the
              N-modular redundancy  (NMR) concept to uniformly handle all types of failures. 
              A  specialized NMR (SNMR) protocol that can tolerate malicious  failures has
              been developed to improve the system performance and  to enhance its
              scalability.  In this research, the SNMR protocol  will be enhanced in several
              ways, including adaptations for wide-  area network applications and for
              efficiently tolerating general  and fail-stop failures.  By adjusting the
              parameters, such as the  replication level and error-checking algorithms, the
              system can  be customized to satisfy various application requirements and  cost
              constraints.  A prototype of the SNMR core will be  implemented in the two-year
              period.  The customizability,  applicability, performance, fault coverage, and
              scalability of  the SNMR system will be thoroughly studied and compared with 
              existing approaches.  ***
