Abstract    :
              9714555  Jacko  The proposed research focuses on the study of human-computer 
              interaction (HCI) in partially sighted individuals.  The  principal
              investigator has made a series of observations of  how the partially sighted
              interact with graphical user  interface (GUI)-based computers.  These
              observations have  resulted in a set of seven hypotheses relating to how 
              partially sighted individuals interact with a GUI computer.  This planning
              grant seeks to test these hypotheses via a  series of experiments to enable the
              investigator, in the  long term, to design improved user interfaces for the 
              partially sighted.  Approximately 100 subjects are to be  studied in these
              experiments.  Each subject will have  undergone a series of standard
              ophthalmology exams, which  will be used to establish an empirical link between
              visual  system physiology and specific HCI behaviors.  ***
