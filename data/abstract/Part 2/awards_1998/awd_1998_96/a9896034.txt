Abstract    :
              The PI is creating a special-purpose programming language in which  optimization
              problems can be specified in a natural and direct way.   The focus is on
              developing associated translation software to  convert such a specification
              into a particular canonical form for  numerical optimization using recently
              developed, ultra-efficient,  interior-point algorithms.  The canonical form is
              a linear-matrix-  inequality (LMI) program, where each constraint takes the
              form of  a requirement that a linear (plus a constant) matrix function of  the
              optimization variables be positive definite.    Control theorists have recently
              demonstrated that a tremendous  variety of common (and uncommon) constraints
              can be put into this  generic form.  Often, however, the required LMI
              constraints are not  related to the underlying problem in an intuitive way. 
              Software to  translate specifications in a "comfortable language" to sets of 
              LMIs is being developed in order to make these powerful  optimization
              techniques easy to apply.  The language is being  applied to real problems in
              communication and signal-processing  circuit designs.
