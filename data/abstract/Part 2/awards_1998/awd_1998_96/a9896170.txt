Abstract    :
                A Physics-Based Geometric Modeling and Design System      This grant provides
              funding for the research and development of a novel interactive design
              environment that integrates traditional design principles with advanced
              physics-based design techniques. The objective of this research is to explore
              and develop flexible, efficient design tools in order for designers to improve
              the efficiency of interactive design during the entire computer-aided design
              and manufacturing process. This research takes the following three-fold
              approach to achieve its goal: (1) Address numerical and  algorithmic problems
              inherent to the physics-based modeling and design approach in a systematic way;
              (2) Devise a set of new force-based design toolkits and investigate the
              effective integration of physics-based design with existing geometric design
              techniques and approaches; and (3) Integrate all the theoretical advances
              gained during the first two stages of this project and further develop an
              experimental physics-based design environment with real-time interactive
              capability based on commercial modeling and design systems.      If successful,
              the results of this research will enable designers to either utilize standard
              geometric design techniques for conventional design or apply various
              physics-based force sculpting tools for direct manipulation of geometric
              primitives in an integrated design environment. Thus, these research advances
              could help to improve product quality, reduce product cost, and increase the
              effectiveness of design engineers. Furthermore, this project seeks to promote
              the rapid dissemination of physics-based design techniques and the accompanying
              experimental design system to the US design and manufacturing industry in order
              to realize the full potential of all the research results. Ultimately, this
              project could advance the state of the art of computer-integrated engineering
              and make significant contributions to geometric and solid modeling, graphics,
              visualization, robotics, computational vision, and virtual environments.
