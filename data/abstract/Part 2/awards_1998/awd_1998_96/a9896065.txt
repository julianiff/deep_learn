Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9700504      Funding is requested for a thermal anemometer system
              to measure the fluctuating temperature and velocity components in a fluctuating
              flow field.  The equipment will be used to study transition from laminar to
              turbulent flow over a heated plate under adverse or favorable pressure
              gradients.  Experimental data obtained using the equipment will be used to
              establish a criterion for the transition to occur.  The work is relevant to
              flow over gas turbine blades.
