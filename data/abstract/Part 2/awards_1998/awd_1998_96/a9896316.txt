Abstract    :
              This project aims to understand the accumulation of free energy in the solar
              corona, the destabilization of energized magnetic field, and the rapid release
              of free energy in flares and mass ejections.  Coronal magnetic energy
              ultimately arises from kinetic energy of the convection zone, but the
              controversy is whether the magnetic fields already carry free energy when they
              erupt from the photosphere to form active regions, free energy propagates into
              the corona from the deep convection zone, or the fields are stressed by motions
              of their photospheric footprints after eruption.  The investigators will
              examine the propagation of twist along a nonuniform flux tube.  In particular,
              they will determine the growth rate and characteristics of the kink instability
              in a horizontal flux tube lying above the photosphere.  In addition, they will
              investigate the release of magnetic energy subsequent to the formation of
              current sheets.
