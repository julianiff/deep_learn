Abstract    :
              Stephan  9407226       Studies of genetic variation and differentiation of
              natural populations are of critical importance for understanding the origin and
              patterns of biological diversity.  One cause of genetic differentiation between
              populations is thought to be natural selection.  In particular, directional
              selection may lead to rapid differentiation between subpopulations in a large,
              partially fragmented population.  Drosophila ananassae, which exists in
              numerous semi-isolated subpopulation, will be used for testing this hypothesis.
               The degree of variation within and differentiation between subpopulations is
              determined at the molecular level by methods of DNA technology.  The impact of
              selection (causing the observed pattern of variation and differentiation) is
              then inferred from these data by computer simulation and
              mathematical-statistical analyses.  This study of genetic variation and
              differentiation is of direct interest to biodiversity and to variation in
              response to conditions of the environment.
