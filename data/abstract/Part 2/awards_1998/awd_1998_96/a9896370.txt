Abstract    :
              Diller proposes to study the iteration of rational maps on complex projective
              space, focusing primarily on birational maps of the projective plane. Chaotic
              sets for such maps tend to occur as the support of certain positive closed
              currents, thus pluripotential theory is a natural tool to use in understanding
              the dynamics of birational maps.  Diller plans to take this insight a step
              further, by understanding a birational map entirely in terms of its action on
              appropriately chosen positive currents.  For instance, he proposes to replace
              the projective plane by a dynamically defined quotient of the space of
              non-constant analytic disks as the natural domain of a birational map.  The
              hope is that since the refined domain will not have points which are
              indeterminate for the map, it will be a more natural setting for constructing
              and understanding the dynamically significant currents.   A dynamical system is
              any process that evolves in time-for instance, the weather or information
              traffic on the internet.   It is often both very useful and very difficult to
              understand the behavior of such systems.  The problems and solutions concerning
              such systems are often mathematical and can be reduced to sets of equations
              which can then be analyzed theoretically by hand or experimentally by computer
              simulation.  This work will contribute to the further understanding of still
              more complicated and ever more realistic systems.
