Abstract    :
              9625887  Cargill  This award is for the development of instrumentation for 
              quantitative strain measurements in crystalline solids with the  goal of 10nm
              lateral spatial resolution and 10-4 strain  sensitivity, with concurrent
              composition and microstructure  mapping capabilities at this resolution.  This
              instrument will  advance x-ray diffraction to the range of spatial resolution 
              usually associated with scanning or transmission electron  microscopy. 
              Nanoscale x-ray diffraction will employ white beam  synchrotron radiation
              collimated and concentrated by a tapered  glass capillary.  Laue diffraction
              patterns from single grains  will be examined with a CCD-based area detector. 
              Strains  within single grains will be determined from lattice parameter 
              measurements using an Si(Li) detector, with careful attention  to stability of
              associated electronics and to optimally fitting  energy peaks in the detector
              output to determine x-ray photon  energies.  %%%  The capabilities to be
              provided by this instrument are  critically important in understanding the
              properties of  nanofarbricated materials.  Understanding the optical 
              properties of quantum well-based structures, the mechanical  properties of
              nanomachines, and the strength and toughness of  nanocomposites require
              quantitative measurements of strain on  the nanometer scale.
