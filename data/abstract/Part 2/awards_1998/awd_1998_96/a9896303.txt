Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CHAPIN  OPP-9523396    A researcher at the University of California
              will conduct two workshops to examine trace-gas feedbacks to global climates,
              water/energy feedbacks to climate, and the role of vegetation structure and
              change in feedbacks to climate.  The workshops will address the importance of
              biodiversity and vegetation structure to large-scale (regional to global)
              processes. The workshops will serve to integrate the results of several
              separate high-latitude programs into a comprehensive framework to determine the
              interactive roles of vegetation and ecosystem processes in the feedback of
              high-latitude ecosystems to global climate.  Separate workshops are planned to
              summarize the vegetation and water feedbacks to climate.  The workshops will
              constitute the U.S. contribution to the International Geosphere-Biosphere
              Programme effort to coordinate North American high-latitude research in global
              change.
