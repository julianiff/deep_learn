Abstract    :
              The proposed research program focuses on the development of multigrid methods
              for convection-dominated flows on distributed architectures.  The research
              covers a wide range of activities from fundamental analysis and development of
              effective multigrid algorithms for convention-dominated flows, to the
              application of these algorithms to a distributed architecture of workstations. 
              In particular, this effort will focus on the two and three dimensional
              compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.  Particular areas of research
              will include an analysis of the importance of propagation effects in multigrid
              algorithms; the development of robust, preconditioners, which will not only
              enhance wave propagation but will also improve high frequency damping for the
              Euler equations; the extensions of these preconditioners to viscous, turbulent
              , and time dependent equations; the development of scalable full-coarsening and
              semi-coarsening multigrid algorithms for distributed compute architectures; and
              the development of a visualization toolkit to interactively monitor the results
              of the distributed multigrid algorithms.
