Abstract    :
              This project will investigate a linear stage of the plasma wave  generation in
              the ionosphere-plasmasphere system due to the  presence of superthermal
              electrons.  The PI will continue to  develop a kinetic theory of superthermal
              electrons in the  ionosphere and plasmasphere.  Project goals will be
              accomplished  through exploration of:  (1) a numerical study of the non-steady-
               state Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation for superthermal electrons  in the
              ionosphere and plasmasphere along open and closed  geomagnetic field lines, (2)
              the non-steady-state coupling of the  superthermal electrons in a new
              time-dependent 20 moment transport  model of multispecies low-B plasma flows,
              (3) an electrodynamical  aspect of the non-steady-state transport of
              superthermal electrons,  and (4) the linear theory of plasma wave generation in
              the  ionosphere-plasmasphere system due to the presence of superthermal 
              electrons.***
