Abstract    :
              9511737  Liao  This project is on research to develop a new framework for 
              metabolic modeling.  The modeling approach treats the system at  two levels: a
              component (molecular) level and a systems level.  The component level consists
              of mechanistic or hybrid/fuzzy  models.  The systems level is the differential
              equations that  result from  the  mass balances on the components, according to
              the metabolic,  regulatory,  or  signal  transduction  pathways.   This 
              modeling  strategy  will be developed and applied to metabolic  and  global 
              regulation pathways in Escherichia coli.  Specific problems to be  examined 
              which  suggest hitherto unknown  regulatory  mechanisms  include: (1) the
              regulation of glucose uptake by enzymes; (2) the  interaction  of central
              metabolism with nitrogen regulation;  and  (3)  the  interaction of central
              metabolism with the  heat  shock  response.  ***
