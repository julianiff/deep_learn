Abstract    :
              9629074  Whitney  This Career Development proposal seeks to characterize the
              effects of fluid composition (H2O:CO2) on crustal melting and products,  and to
              characterize how pluton and migmatites are related to on another. This research
              will resolve several questions concerning crustal magmatism by integrating
              experimental, analytical, and field study of three migmatite complexes that are
              inferred to have formed by partial melting of crustal rocks and that are
              spatially associated with silicic plutons. A new intermediate-level class for
              undergraduates will be created based in part on going and proposed research in
              Turkey. This new class (Geology, Environment and Civilization) will focus on
              giving students a basic understanding of earth systems and human interactions
              with the physical environment, emphasizing the role of geology in the
              development and evolution of ancient and modern civilizations. All stages of
              the research will be integrated with the undergraduate and graduate petrology
              curricula at UNC-CH.
