Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the housing and economic development policy choices
              made by city public policy makers in the United States.  The goal of this
              research is to explain the variation in housing policies among American cities.
              The project will (1) determine the effect of inter-city competition on the
              initiation and support for affordable housing policy and programs, (2) identify
              political factors influence housing policy decisions, and (3) evaluate the
              tradeoff between affordable housing and economic development.  A stratified
              sample of cities with populations of 25,000 or more will be the focus of a mail
              survey of principal policy makers including the city mayor.  Four cities will
              be chosen as case studies based on the quantitative analyses of the survey
              responses.  The results of this study will provide a baseline for a
              longitudinal analysis of city housing policy in 2005.      This project falls
              under the domain of the Human Capital Initiative.
