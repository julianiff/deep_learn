Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT         This work will monitor the deposition and growth of thin
              films onto a surface at the molecular level using a novel microcalorimeter to
              measure the energy release during deposition of the film. Besides the
              development of a diagnostic tool and the fundamental measurement of energy
              release during molecular-thickness thin-film deposition, the work may lead to a
              method for control of industrial thin-film deposition.
