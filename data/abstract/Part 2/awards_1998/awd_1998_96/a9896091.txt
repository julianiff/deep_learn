Abstract    :
                This award will support the development advanced software tools  for
              establishing a database containing information about the  structural and
              dynamic functional attributes of identified  neurons, and the development of
              advanced software tools for  querying that database for information about the
              global  functional organization of neuronal ensembles. The visual format  of
              the databases developed with these tools will be  multidimensional "atlases",
              which preserve the spatial  relationships between all objects within the
              nervous systems.  These project will be carried out as a collaborative effort 
              between a group of neurobiologists and computer scientists at the  Berkeley and
              San Diego campuses of the University of California.    The major specific aims
              are to develop a general database engine  capable of representing information
              about the functionally  relevant neuronal attributes of the objects (such as
              their  biochemical, biophysical, genetic and developmental  characteristics);
              the 3D anatomical parameters of neural  structures across multiple resolution
              scales; the functional  characteristics of these objects which determine their
              individual  "input/output" properties; and the functional relations between 
              neuronal objects which determine their dynamic interactions; to  develop
              advanced software tools for inserting the anatomical,  functional and
              relational information into the database and to  develop advanced query tools
              for retrieving and analyzing the  data.
