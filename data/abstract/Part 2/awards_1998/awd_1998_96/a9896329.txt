Abstract    :
              9709508  Bai    This research develops the econometric theory for a class of
              nonlinear dynamic models, referred to as dynamic index-threshold models.  These
              models describe multiple regimes in which regime switching is governed by an
              unobservable index.  The index itself is a linear combination of a number of
              observable variables with unknown index coefficients.  This research addresses
              the following issues pertaining to the dynamic-index threshold models:  1.
              Determining the probability structure of the dynamic index-threshold model,
              such as its stationarity and ergodicity;  2. Determining the statistical
              properties of the estimators, such as consistency, rate of convergence, and
              limiting distributions;  3. Testing the hypothesis of stationarity against
              dynamic index-threshold autoregression; and   4. Solving the computational
              problems for the dynamic index-threshold models.  No general econometric theory
              has yet been developed for dynamic index-threshold models despite their
              usefulness for demand analysis when consumers face a kinked budget set
              resulting from, say, welfare programs, taxation and block-pricing schemes.
