              Research Planning Grant  Principal Investigator:        Constance A. Schall 
              Affiliation:                          University of Tulsa        The
              investigator proposes to initiate research in the area of nucleation of protein
              crystals. This is an important area with tremendous applications in protein
              purification, structure determination etc.   However, protein crystallization
              is still an art, to a large extent, and it is important that new researchers
              bring scientific rationales to the phenomenon thereby allowing technological
              exploitation.      The investigator qualifications are excellent at this stage
              of research experience and maturity.  The institutional facilities are
              appropriate, but the university has not done much to encourage research
              activity by providing a start up package for the PI.  It is disappointing that
              the PI has to purchase even basic research instrumentation (mixer, analytical
              balance) from the grant; the institution should have helped in this regard.    
              Nevertheless, this is a worthy PI who has shown promise in her graduate work,
              and the grant should foster the development of her research career.     The
              program officer recommends funding of this proposal.
