Abstract    :
              The Historical Statistics Project is a major collaborative effort to produce an
              updated, revised, expanded, and electronically-accessible new edition of the
              Historical Statistics of the United States.  The previous edition of Historical
              Statistics, now long out of date (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975), is a
              massive, two-volume compendium of 54 chapters on topics touching all of the
              social, behavioral, humanistic, and natural sciences, including economics,
              government, finance, sociology, demography, education, law, natural resources,
              climate, religion, international migration, and trade.  The new Millennial
              Edition of Historical Statistics of the United States will be accessible to
              researchers, educators, students, and the general public.  The award provides
              support for the central management of the project for the first year (1998) of
              the three-year activity.  This support is essential to insure the timely
              completion of the project and the accuracy and reliability of the text.
