Abstract    :
              9357827   Lee      This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Jay H. Lee 
               under the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator   Program.      The
              objective of this research is to devise an integrated   modelling/estimation
              and control technique suitable for   complex chemical plant operations.  The
              three key areas of   process control: modelling, estimation, and control, and  
              interdependent and need to be studied on common grounds.  A   synergistic
              framework will be developed that can be readily   applied in practice. 
              Nonlinearity, model uncertainty,   adaptivity, and operational ease will be
              addressed within a   common framework.  The PI plans to use Model Predictive  
              Control (MPC) as the flexible framework for these issues.      The theory will
              be applied to devising control schemes for a   pulp digester and a 20 tray
              bubble-cap distillation column.    Ultimately it is planned to expand the
              application areas to   include electrochemical processes such as fuel cells and
                batteries.
