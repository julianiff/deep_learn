Abstract    :
              9622343  Reeder         This award supports the research of Professor M. Reeder
              to work in automorphic functions.  He intends to work on unipotent
              representations of reductive p-adic algebraic groups. He also intends to work
              on p-adic harmonic analysis. The idea here is to see how various computation
              relating to Plancheral measures relate to the geometry of the fixed point
              varieties of flag manifolds.       Automorphic function theory arose out of
              Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Both
              mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is
              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of
              geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus
              to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and
              coding theory in information theory.    ??
