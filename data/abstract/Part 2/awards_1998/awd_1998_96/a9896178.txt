Abstract    :
              The  research  in  this proposal addresses the nature  of  visual 
              problem-solving  and  its  impact on the  design  of  cooperative  systems 
              which  assist and enhance human performance  in  complex  task  environments. 
              The first objective of  the  project  is  to  extend  the  cognitive theory of
              perception  and  problem-solving  interactions, with an emphasis on specific
              visual problem-solving  tasks.   More extensive analysis of previously
              collected protocol  data  in  the field of diagnostic radiology will be carried
               out,  and   additional   data  from  a  second  visual  problem-solving 
              application  such  as geographical information  systems  will  be  collected 
              and analyzed as well.  The results of this  work   are  expected to lead to an
              improved model of visual interaction,  and  a  more comprehensive theory of how
              people use visual information  to   solve problems.  The second objective of
              the project  is  to  apply  this  cognitive theory in the development  of 
              intelligent  interactive   systems   which   provide   assistance   to   human 
              decision-makers   in   tasks  such  as  medical   diagnosis   and  geographical
                image  interpretation.   The   design    will   be  incorporated  into a
              number of working prototypes to  demonstrate  proof  of  concept as well as to
              provide practical platforms  for  testing  and evaluation of underlying
              cognitive principles.   The  entire research project will be carried out in the
              context  of  a  comprehensive   educational   program   which   emphasizes   
              the  development  of  visual  problem-solving aids  for  several  core  courses
              in a newly evolving computer science curriculum.
