Abstract    :
              9501285  Franzoni  This CAREER award deals with research and educational 
              development in the area of structural dynamics and acoustics  with a special
              emphasis on the Asymptotic Modal Analysis  (AMA) method. This method is
              particularly suited for a study  of complex dynamic systems in the
              middle-to-high frequency  range with moderate -to- large levels of damping such
              as in  the case of transportation and flight vehicles. The  currently available
              AMA method is extended to AMA - hybrid  method, which predicts responses of
              moderately to highly  damped systems. This is a combination of AMA and 
              perturbation methods that yields physical insights into the  role of modal
              coupling and damping and closed form  solutions. The educational component
              includes teaching,  mentoring, outreach, and extension activities aimed at pre 
              college students, undergraduates, graduate students, and  practicing engineers.
              Examples include administering a  summer program for high school students,
              supervising  undergraduate  research projects, mentoring graduate  students,
              and organizing technical meetings with tutorials  for the exchange of ideas
              between the academe and the  industry.***
