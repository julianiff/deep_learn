Abstract    :
              In this project, an innovative design of a mega-sub structural configuration for
              a tall building is proposed and its effectiveness in suppression of building
              vibration resulting from wind and/or seismic loads is investigated.  A building
              using the mega-sub configuration consists of two major component structures: 
              the mega structure which not only supports the sub structure but also resists
              external loads, and the sub structure which provides the usable space for
              either commercial or residential purposes.  From the physics point of view, the
              kinetic energy of the mega-structure generated by the external loads flows into
              the sub structure resulting in a  vibration suppression of the mega structure. 
              In the meantime, the energy transferred to the sub structure can be dissipated
              by properly designed damping of the sub structure, so that the acceleration of
              sub structure can also be reduced, thus minimizing the acceleration-related
              risk for the contents of the sub-structures as well as human discomfort. 
              Preliminary study has demonstrated the significant effectiveness and efficiency
              of the mega-sub control system in reducing the vibration of tall buildings
              under turbulent wind loads.  The following tasks will be conducted: (a)
              establishment of a realistic model for mega-sub structures, (b) development of
              design-consistent wind and seismic load models, (c) optimization study of
              dynamic parameters for design, (d) design of mega-sub building to achieve
              desired dynamic parameters, (e) design of semi-active/active/hybrid systems and
              (f) practical design of mega-sub structure.  This research is expected to
              contribute to a new generation of tall buildings which are designed with
              seismic and wind safety.
