Abstract    :
              9614722  McClelland   Recent studies have significantly changed traditional
              views of the late Proterozoic- early paleozoic paleogeographic reconstructions
              for Laurentia and Gondwana.  Essentially two models are current:  eastern North
              America and western South America were in proximity due to actual collision
              between Laurentia and Gondwana, or only a rifted portion of North American
              collided with South America, with a large ocean remaining between the
              continental masses.  This research will test these options by study of a belt
              of ultramafic and mafic rocks along the west side of the Precordillera which
              represents the postulated Laurentia- Precordillera ocean.  In particular, age
              dating will address both crystallization and metamorphic ages of these rocks,
              which differ in each scenario.  Results are expected to clarify models for
              Paleozoic tectonics in southwestern South American by providing information
              about the ocean basin to the west of the Precordillera terrane and provide the
              basis for a test between the collisional model and the rifted and drifted
              terrane model.
