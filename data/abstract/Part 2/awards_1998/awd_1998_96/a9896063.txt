Abstract    :
              9401367  Ruan       The investigator intends to continue his work in the area of
               symplectic topology and its application to string theory.  More  precisely, he
              plans to work on the mathematical foundations of  topological sigma
              model-quantum cohomology theory, to use  topological sigma model invariants to
              study Calabi-Yau manifolds  and surfaces of general type, to continue to work
              on symplectic  extremal rays and symplectomophisms, in particular, degenerate 
              fixed points of exact symplectomorphisms.       Topological properties are
              special properties that  remain unchanged under the small deformation of
              objects that the  investigator studies.  Studying topological properties in all
               branches of mathematics has been in the center of mathematics for  the past
              century.  This project studies some topological  properties arising from
              mathematical physics, in particular, from  string theory.  But those
              topological properties are not ordinary  topological phenomenon known before. 
              They belong to a new kind  of topological theory-Symplectic topology, which the
              investigator  believes will provide much better understanding both for topology
               theory and for string theory.  ***
