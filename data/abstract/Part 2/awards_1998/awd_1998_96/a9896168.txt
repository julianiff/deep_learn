Abstract    :
              INT 9513261  Coffin      This U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
              Debra Coffin of Colorado State University and Edit Kovacs-Lang of the Hungarian
              Academy of Sciences' Institute of Ecology and Botany will evaluate the
              importance of drought and soil texture to arid and semiarid grasslands in both
              countries.  Specifically, field studies and model simulations will be used to
              evaluate effects of climate and soils on plant biodiversity, spatial pattern
              and temporal dynamics.  Results should yield a wealth of species- and
              community-level data that may be used to predict changes in the structure of
              dry grasslands and to develop controls on vegetation dynamics.  Such new
              information can be useful in interpreting the broader effects of global climate
              change on the grassland biome, which altogether accounts for about 24 percent
              of the earth's surface cover.    This long-term ecological research project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.  ??
