Abstract    :
              Florida  Institute of Technology, and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de
              Mexico will hold Sian Ka'an 97, the Second Joint Mexico-US International
              Workshop on Neural networks and neurocontrol,  August 19-29, 1997, in Playa del
              Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico.  The ten day conference will provide an
              opportunity for academic and industrial researcher of the united States and
              Mexico, other invited guests, and graduate students, to exchange ideas and
              research results with the aim of enhancing the overall research effort reducing
              duplication, and encouraging cooperation among the participants.  Sian Ka'an 97
              will follow the general plan of the very successful Sian Ka'an 95, which was
              held in September, 1995.  the conference is comprised of three main stands:
              keynote addresses and panel discussions by leader sin the field, poster
              sessions for contributed papers, and practical experience with interesting
              neural network and neurocontrol applications.  Approximately twenty speaker
              have been invited to present keynote talks describing the state of the art  of
              topics related to the development of the theoretical and applied aspects of
              neural networks and neurocontrol.  Groups of several related talks will be
              followed by an informal discussion in the form of panel chaired by one of the
              keynote speakers.  Invited and contributed papers will be presented in poster
              sessions to allow for discussion of particular research results.  The
              conference will also include a hands-on workshop for students and beginners
              interested in having some practice and more basic information about the topics
              addressed in the conference presentations and poster sessions.
