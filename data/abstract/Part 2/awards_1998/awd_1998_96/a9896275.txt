Abstract    :
              The steadily decreasing cost of wireless mobile communications and its growing 
              deployment have resulted in its increased popularity. The trend towards
              software  radio base-station, one such instance, opens up a new avenue of
              possibilities for  innovative baseband signal processing technologies in
              wireless communications  which in turn, introduces new challenges in academic
              research due to the complex  and interdisciplinary nature of practical systems.
               The development of future  high performance wireless systems requires the
              integration of technological  advances that span a broad area of communications
              and signal processing subjects.    This research involves the development and
              design of a wireless communication  laboratory, and the implementation of a
              high performance antenna array CMDA  wireless network.  Focussing on critical
              issues like complexity and robustness,  the investigator seeks theoretically
              sound and algorithmically feasible solutions  to the multipath fading problem
              unique to wireless mobile systems.  Key to the  new system is a self-adaptive
              CDMA receiver that is capable of tracking  environmental variations without the
              use of training sequences.  The novel  methodologies developed here take
              advantage of both spatial and temporal  diversities in a unified fashion,
              thereby allowing optimum performance to be  realized without introducing undue
              complexity.
