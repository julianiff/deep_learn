              9416548  Yund                          PROJECT ABSTRACT         This proposal
              will explore the impact of population  density on the relationship between
              gamete production and  reproductive success in a colonial ascidian.  Previous 
              research has found that variation in population density will  affect the
              relationship between gamete production and  reproductive success differently in
              male and female-phase  colonies.  The relationship between production and the 
              number of fertilization obtained by a colony is expected to  be linear in
              competitive situations (high population  densities), but plateau in
              noncompetitive situations (low  population densities) at the male gamete
              production level  that allows a male to fertilize all of the eggs in his 
              vicinity.  In contrast, the relationship between egg  production and the number
              of offspring produced by a colony  is expected to be linear at low population
              densities (where  male gamete limit the number of eggs fertilized), but 
              plateau at high population densities due to constraints on  the number of
              embryos that colonies can brood.   These  hypotheses will be tested in this
              research project by  establishing experimental populations of ascidians that
              vary  in gamete production under two density conditions and  assaying male and
              female reproductive success.  Male  reproductive success will be assayed by
              using allozyme  markers to assign paternity, while female reproductive  success
              will be assayed by directly counting the proportion  of eggs fertilized in each
              brood .  This study will  contribute to our knowledge of benthic marine
              organisms by  examining the selective pressures that fertilization  processes
              can exert on gamete allocation patterns.
