Abstract    :
              The focus of this research may be divided into five areas.  First,   asymmetric
              synthesis methodology involving pseudoephedrine as a chiral   auxiliary will be
              developed.   Second, the syncytium-forming inhibitor   terpestacin will be
              synthesized.  Third, the HIV protease inhibitor   L-696,474 will be prepared. 
              Fourth, new synthetic methodology will be   developed for the synthesis of
              allenes, for the reductive transposition   of allylic alcohols, and for the
              production of radicals from alcohols for   use in deoxygenation and cyclization
              reactions.  Fifth,  methodology for   the the sequencing of polypeptides and
              proteins from the carboxyl   terminus will be developed.  With this prior
              award, the Synthetic Organic   Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew
              G. Myers of the   Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of
              Technology.    Professor Myers will focus his work on the development of a wide
              variety   of synthetic methods that will provide new tools for the elaboration
              of   important organic molecules.
