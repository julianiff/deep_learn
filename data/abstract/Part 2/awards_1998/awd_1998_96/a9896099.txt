Abstract    :
              PI: Scott Creel  #9712613    This small grant for exploratory research (SGER)
              concerns  the development and application of microsatellite DNA  methods for
              genetic typing of African wild dogs from field  samples.  The PI's ongoing
              research has allowed a rare  opportunity to develop a new set of techniques
              that may have  far-reaching applicability.  Previous efforts in this study  to
              obtain blood and tissue samples have caused injury to the  animals, which
              cannot be tolerated in an endangered species.  Alternative means of analysis of
              DNA extracted from wasted  material of carnivores has been especially
              difficult, as the  quality if the DNA material is degraded.  However, new 
              techniques recently developed in this study have shown  promise in providing
              reliable and efficient means of genetic  analysis from samples collected in the
              field.  The project  is a novel, completely non-invasive approach to collection
               of DNA from field populations.  This advanced could enable  the development
              and application of new techniques for many  animal species, which would be
              especially valuable in field  research and conservation of endangered species.
