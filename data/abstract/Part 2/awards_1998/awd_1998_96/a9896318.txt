Abstract    :
              This project will study the development and use of mathematics discourse as a
              function of the cultural activities in which students participate at home, in
              their local community, in the larger community, and at school.  This study
              would extend work by prior researchers by investigating the influence of
              culture and socioeconomic status (SES) on the discourse practices developed by
              people to deal with concepts such as measuring, counting, predicting,
              comparing, and contrasting as related to a range of activities.  Also in
              contrast to similar work by others, this research will focus on analyzing
              actual activities rather than participants' later descriptions of those
              activities.  The results of this research will inform efforts to understand
              cultural and SES differences in mathematics achievement and to provide equal
              mathematics learning opportunities for all students.
