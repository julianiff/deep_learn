Abstract    :
              9523476  Powell      The proposed study is to operate and maintain the
              Coordinating  Office of the Scientific Steering Committee of US GLOBEC. The 
              Office has four main functions in the central role of scientific  planning,
              coordination, support and communication for the overall  project.  The most
              important of these four are scientific planning  and coordination which
              includes logistics and support for the US  GLOBEC Scientific Steering
              Committee. A major task for the Office  is coordination with the federal
              agencies that fund GLOBEC.  Finally, the Office supports and conducts
              communication with the  large and diverse GLOBEC community in the US and
              overseas.  The  Coordinating Office is located in the Department of Integrative
               Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.
