Abstract    :
              9501774  Bent    This career development project describes research and 
              education thrusts to be implemented over the next five  years.  It includes the
              development of a research program  that addresses a molecular-level
              understanding of surface  chemical processes that describe microelectronics
              materials  fabrication processes such as chemical vapor deposition,  chemical
              etching, and lithography.  The education thrusts  include focusing on the
              concepts of "connected curriculum"  and "active learning."  The goal is to
              develop  instructional methods and a novel curriculum that allows  for students
              to actively learn material which they see as  an integral part of the world
              around them.  %%%  This award provides NSF support for a junior faculty member 
              to develop a full, balanced academic career in areas of  science and education
              of high priority.  ***
