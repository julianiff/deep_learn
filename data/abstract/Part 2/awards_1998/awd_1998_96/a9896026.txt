Abstract    :
              This is an NYI award for FY 92.  The research will focus on two                
              areas: (1) diffusive voiding in metallizations caused by                       
              electromigration and thermal stress, and (2) mechanics of                      
              ferroelectric ceramics.  The first problem area involves                       
              diffusive voiding in metal interconnects in very large-scale                   
              integrated (VLSI) circuits.  A unified approach to thermal                     
              voiding and electromigration will be developed that will                       
              establish the explicit dependence of the phenomena on design                   
              variables such as material properties, current density, thermal                
              history and interconnect configuration.  This will enable the                  
              mathematical model so created to be validated by comparison to a               
              variety of experimental results.  The second problem area is                   
              concerned with deformation, polarization and degradation of                    
              ferroelectric ceramics.  The research will provide an analytical               
              framework relating the mechanisms of domain wall motion and                    
              twinning to macroscopic response between stress, electric field,               
              deformation and polarization of ferroelectric ceramics.  This                  
              physically-based constitutive relation would be used to study the              
              important phenomena of fatigue cracking under alternating                      
              electric fields.
