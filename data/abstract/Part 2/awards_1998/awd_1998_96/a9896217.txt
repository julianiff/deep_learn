Abstract    :
              JAMES GROTBERG  NORTHWESTERN  CTS-9412523    ABSTRACT    The work deals with two
              groups of projects involving interfacial fluid mechanics and which are related
              to the pulmonary system: (a) capillary-elastic instabilities which are
              fundamental to the stability of small airways as they close and re-open; and
              (b) soluto-capillary wave propagation of surfactant spreading and transport of
              dissolved drugs along the lining of the lung. The first part of the work
              addresses the fundamental nature of airway closure, how it is modified in
              diseases and how it may be prevented with various interventions. The second
              part of the research addresses the basic fluid mechanics and transport of
              surfactant (and drug) spreading under a variety of normal and pathological
              conditions with the aim of quantifying delivery rates.  This will aid in the
              understanding of drug delivery in the treatment of various diseases, whereby
              surfactant is delivered externally, either directly through an endotracheal
              tube or through inhalation.
