Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed project is to design efficient  algorithms applicable
              to security and computational issues that  are core concerns of statistical
              agencies and database vendors.  Results obtained from the project will be
              implemented to test  theoretical models as well as to advance technology
              transfers.  Building on the PI's completed work on statistical data security, 
              a number of specific research directions are pursued to further  determine the
              computational complexity of detecting and  protecting sensitive information in
              highly useful types of  statistical data bases.  These directions involve
              techniques from  a variety of algorithms areas including combinatorial 
              optimization, dynamic algorithms, graph algorithms, linear  algebraic
              algorithms, and online competitive analysis.  It is  expected that algorithmic
              insights and techniques obtained from  this project will be useful in various
              application areas in  addition to statistical data security, such as relational
               databases and secret sharing schemes.
