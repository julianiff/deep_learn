Abstract    :
              9626252  Rong    The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
              geometry. More specifically, it deals with various applications of collapsed
              Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature to global Riemannian
              geometry. These applications include structures of fundamental groups of
              compact manifolds, and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type theorems for noncompact
              manifolds.    Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of spaces possessing a
              notion of distance. These are abstract spaces in that a Riemannian manifold
              does not have to lie in an ambient space, unlike curves and surfaces in
              3-space. Collapsed Riemannian manifolds have certain 'singularities' which make
              them harder to study, but they arise naturally as limits of certain families of
              nonsingular Riemannian manifolds.
