Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Markman, Arthur  Columbia University  SBR-9510924    The PI has
              submitted this proposal under the Faculty Early Career Development Program  
              (CAREER).  He proposes ten studies on decision making.  The conceptual
              underpinning   for this research program is  comparison-based architecture for
              choice  (COBAC).  The   central principles of this model are predicated on the 
              alignability  of the features   belonging to various choice options.  Decision
              makers make more use of alignable than   non-alignable features.  Furthermore
              decision makers will attempt to convert the latter   into the former.  Some of
              the studies will use think-aloud and other process-tracing   methodologies. 
              The PI will also examine the importance of goals in choice behavior.   
              Finally, a computational model will be constructed on the basis of the results
              of these   studies.  The educational plan involves the PI s participation both
              in the development of   computer-assisted instruction and in the revision of
              the statistics/experimental design   curricula in his home institution.
