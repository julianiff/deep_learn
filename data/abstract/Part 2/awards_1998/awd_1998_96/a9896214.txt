Abstract    :
              9625047  Katz  This is an award to support research to be conducted by this 
              investigator on factors that influence the movement and fate of  metal ion
              contaminants of surface and groundwaters.  The research  she will conduct
              addresses environmental problems associated with  energy and raw material
              production and past management practices  that require reliable quantitative
              prediction of the effect these  potential contaminants have on water resources.
               Her research was  previously supported under a Research Initiation Award, NSF
              Grant  No. BCS 92-10869.  The expected results of this research include 
              formulation and evaluation of predictive models for contaminant  transport that
              can be used in engineering design of systems to  prevent, reduce or eliminate
              the pollutional effect metal ions have  on water resources.  The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF  95-118, Faculty Early
              Career Development (CAREER) Program  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals. 
              As such, it not only  addressed the proposed research but related the
              investigator's  career development plan to the current state of knowledge in
              the  field and of the potential impact work supported under this award  would
              result in educational innovation to the current state of  knowledge on
              effective teaching and learning in the investigator's  discipline.
