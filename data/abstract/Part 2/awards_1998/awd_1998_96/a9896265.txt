Abstract    :
                9602564  Michael      Existing technologies will be used in an attempt to
              resurrect extinct species of Eleutherotlactylus frogs from frozen tissue
              samples. Previously frozen single sperm will be injected into enucleated eggs
              of closely related species. Diploid nuclei will be generated from single sperm
              by pressure inhibition of the first round of cellular cleavage, during which
              time the genome will replicate once. Initial experiments will be carried out
              with same-species sperm injections using existing species. Further confirmatory
              experiments with crossspecies sperm injections using other existing species
              will be performed before frozen samples from extinct species are utilized.
              Previously frozen, stored sperm from each of two extinct species will be used
              with enucleated eggs from two closely related existing species. Resulting frogs
              will be raised to adulthood and identified as to species by morphological and
              molecular methods..
