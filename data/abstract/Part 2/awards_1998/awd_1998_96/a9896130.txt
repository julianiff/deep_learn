Abstract    :
              A group member who is especially salient in the group because of a distinctive
              characteristic is referred to as a solo.  Women and minorities who occupy
              senior positions within organizations often do so as solos.  Researchers have
              suggested a number of ways in which solo status may have important long term
              consequences for the ultimate success or failure of the solo individual in an
              organization.  For example, solos often attract increased attention from
              observers, and they are often evaluated negatively and on the basis of
              stereotypes rather than actual performance.  The proposed research will examine
              two basic issues.  First, whether solo status increases the likelihood for
              solos to emerge as leaders in task groups.  Second, whether observed solo
              effects vary as a function of the perceived salience of the solo.  The proposed
              research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological
              processes that characterize solo arrangements in group settings.  Results of
              the proposed research should also clarify how such effects occur in race
              contexts.
