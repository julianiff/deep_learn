Abstract    :
              9553438  Horwitz    This 36 month project assesses the educational effectiveness
              of a  new paradigm for science education software, the hypermodel. This 
              includes multimedia and animation relating computer representations  to
              corresponding objects and processes in nature.  GenScope, a  prototype
              hypermodel for investigating genetics, is currently under  development.  It
              supports open-ended exploration at five levels:   DNA, chromosomes, organism,
              pedigree and population thus having  applications in molecular biology,
              cellular biology, physiology,  Mendelian inheritance, and population genetics. 
              The GenScope  models.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the
              educational  effectiveness of the hypermodel technology as a complement to the 
              traditional textbook and lecture approach and to implement the  tools,
              protocols, and standards necessary to facilitate the  creation of others by
              researchers, teachers, curriculum developers,  and students.  The project
              provides networking support to share  data, parts of models and full models.   
              In addition to some technical gains in multimedia and networked  models, the
              project will examine the impact of the multi-level  hypermodel on individual
              student's understanding.  The "seamless"  levels allow students to delve into
              why something happens on more  and more fundamental levels, ultimately down to
              the molecular.   Conversely, students can look at the impacts and generalize
              from  the specific to more general cases by moving up levels from the 
              molecular to the most general, populations.  This project will  define which
              content and reasoning skills are pertinent and should  be studied in the
              research.  It will determine which of these  "elicit which components of
              understanding."  ***
