Abstract    :
              Burns, Jack  AST 96-16132    Dr. Burns will continue investigations of the
              environments  of clusters and groups of galaxies using observations at  radio,
              optical and X-ray wavelengths, along with numerical  simulations using a code
              which is a hybrid of N-body and  hydrodynamics codes.  The observations will
              concentrate on  96 Abell clusters with a redshift near 0.2 and 24 X-ray 
              bright, distant clusters.  The combination of modeling and  observations will
              concentrate on questions about the  evolution of clusters, the intracluster
              medium, radio  galaxies and the general cluster galaxy population.
