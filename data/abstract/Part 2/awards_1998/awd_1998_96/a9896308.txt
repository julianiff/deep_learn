Abstract    :
                    Abstract  9630635  Martin        The goal of this research is to gain a
              detailed understanding of pathogen recognition and signal transduction events
              involved in plant disease resistance.  Two experimental systems in tomato are
              being studied, resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  (causative agent
              of bacterial speck disease) conferred by the Pto gene and sensitivity to the
              fenthion insecticide conferred by the Fen gene.  The Pto and Fen genes are
              members of a small gene family encoding closely related serine/threonine
              protein kinases.  In the proposed research several genes that have been shown
              to encode proteins that physically interact with the Pto kinase will be
              characterized.  These proteins will be examined using biochemical techniques
              and transgenic approaches.  In addition, genes will be identified which are
              regulated by the Pto and Fen kinases, and they will used to examine the
              pathways whereby plants defend themselves from pathogens.  These studies will
              aid in our understanding of the molecular basis of recognition and signal
              transduction events involved in plant defense against pathogens.
