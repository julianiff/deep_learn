Abstract    :
              The wavelet transform with symmetric basis functions is emerging as a next- 
              generation standard for still-image compression.  Wavelet methods outperform
              the  current JPEG standard at low bitrates, and degrade gracefully with
              decreasing  bitrate.  The new M-channel symmetric wavelets are used in image
              and video  coders, with particular attention to quantization strategies and
              motion  compensation.  This research is addressing the theory, design, and
              application  of orthogonal and biorthogonal linear-phase M-channel filter banks
              and M-band  symmetric wavelets.  Multirate filter banks are the fundamental
              building blocks  for subband and wavelet decompositions, as well as
              frequency-domain/time-domain  multiplexing.  Theoretical questions being
              addressed by the research include the  structure of linear-phase M-channel
              filter banks and wavelets, including a  comprehensive theory of permissible
              lengths, minimal structures for  parametrization and fast computation, and
              mappings for two-dimensional signal  processing.  Criteria for wavelet filter
              design are also being addressed,  including vanishing moments, smoothness and
              nonnegativity of the scaling  function, and unequal length filters.    The
              investigators are studying applications of the above to perceptually-based 
              data compression of image, video and seismic data, multicarrier modulation, and
               multiscale feature detections.  They are also investigating the use of the
              M-band  wavelet transform for multitone modulation.  The frequency partitioning
               properties of the M-channel filter bank enable high efficiency for channels
              such  as twisted-pair copper wire and hybrid fiber-coax, with reduced
              susceptibility  to narrow-band interference.
