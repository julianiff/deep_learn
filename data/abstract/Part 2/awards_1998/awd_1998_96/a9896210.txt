Abstract    :
              9706663  Ritsema    This research involves the use of the expanding data base of
              high-  quality, broad-band digital seismic networks, both permanent and 
              temporary to invert for earth structure in regions previously  undersampled,
              especially the lower mantle.  Several source-  receiver path geometries provide
              unique sampling of the lowermost  mantle beneath the Indian, South Pacific and
              Atlantic oceans that  cannot be obtained with comparable detail with past
              seismic  station coverage.  The construction of seismic models for  unmapped
              regions and the analysis of the full spectrum of length  scales over which
              seismic velocity structure varies in the lower  mantle are primary goals. 
              These aspects remain crucial to  advancing our understanding of the relation of
              seismic structure  to the thermal and chemical composition of the region, and
              their  influence on dynamical processes near the core-mantle boundary.  ***
