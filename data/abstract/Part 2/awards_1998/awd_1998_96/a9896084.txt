Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9712481  SCARPELLO    U.S. technology policy has traditionally
              relied on tax incentives and subsidies to stimulate private R&D investment.  In
              recent years, in an effort to encourage cooperation and in response to foreign
              technological rivalry, the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (NCRA) was
              passed.  Under this Act, firms that notify the Federal Trade Commission and the
              U.S. Department of Justice and their intention to form a joint R&D agreement,
              can reduce the risk of private antitrust litigation.  The number of R&D
              consortia has gradually increased over time since 1984 and by 1992, 325 R&D
              consortia had filed with the Department of Justice.    Most Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) and Engineering research Center (ERCs)
              arise through sponsorship by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The NSF's
              goals are to stimulate the rate of adoption of the results of engineering,
              scientific, and technological research, and to increase the non-federal
              investment in research and development.  The NSF I/UCRC program now has 52
              centers, spanning over 70 universities with over 700 participating companies
              and agencies.  The success of the I/UCRCs/ERCs hinge upon identifying,
              attracting, and retaining firms interested in funding and participating in
              research.    This project will attempt to identify the factors that elicit a
              firm to join an R&D consortium and so will help in targeting firms to be
              approached for membership.  Securing membership in an I/UCRC/ERC however
              depends on the recruitment strategies adopted and the perceived effectiveness
              of the Center.
