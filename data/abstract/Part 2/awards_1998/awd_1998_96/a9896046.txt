Abstract    :
              9628127  Garnero    This research involves the use of seismic broad-band digital
              data  to address fundamental questions about the structure of the deep  Earth
              in the vicinity of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) region.   The work will
              concentrate on the highly variable, 150-350 km thick,  2-3%
              above-average-velocity D" layer which is just above the CMB.   Key features to
              investigate will be scale lengths of heterogeneity,  scattering properties,
              preferred orientation of anomalies, and a  possible low velocity layer at the
              base of the CMB.  The results  bear on questions of large-scale mantle
              circulation, localized  convection patterns, heat flow from the core, thermal
              boundary  layer structure above the CMB, possible chemical or partial-melt 
              reservoirs, deep Earth plume sources, and deviations in the Earth's  magnetic
              field.    ***
