Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Jonathan Marks   SBR-9306205    The major triumph of
              applying molecular techniques in anthropological systematics was the finding
              that humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are more closely related to one another
              than either is to the orang-utan.  Not only are they closely related, but it is
              now clear that they are genetically approximately equidistant from one another,
              with the majority of workers now believing that chimpanzees are more closely
              related to humans than they are to gorillas - although there continues to be a
              debate on the resolution of this "trichotomy."    The goal of this research
              project  is to refine and apply the new and powerful technique of flourscent in
              situ hyubridization (FISH) to the phylogenetic analysis of chromosome
              rearrangements shared among the great apes and humans.  Specific regions of DNA
              whose positions have been precisely mapped to human chromosomes will be used as
              probes to the corresponding positions on chromosomes of the apes.  In this way,
              Marks will be able to identify the precise nature of chromosomal rearrangements
              that have taken place in the course of hominoid evolution, and may help to
              resolve the "trichotomy."  ***  P:\anthro\jfried\9306205.abs    erved.
