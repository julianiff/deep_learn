Abstract    :
              9505338  Ng  The objective of this research is:  1) to non-invasively  visualize
              the  interior and the behavior of a suitable mass of granular  material by MRI 
              (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and 2) to verify the  microscopic observations 
              obtained by DEM (Discrete Element Method) simulations.  Available  macroscopic
              DEM results on random arrays of ellipsoids  produced by others  are very
              promising.  They provide qualitatively correct  results and some  good
              quantitative predictions for a wide range of strains,  drained and  undrained
              loading, and static as well as cyclic loading.  However, 3-D  observations are
              needed for verification.  This research is  feasible with  the availability of
              MRI.  The results will provide a general  theoretical  framework for modeling
              the constitutive relations of  granular soils.  ***      9505340  Nakagawa  The

              method will be developed to determine constitutive  models of soils  directly
              from the results of soil tests.  The primary  objective is to  develop and
              experimentally verify this method of  determination, with the  results applied
              to the determination of the constitutive  properties of  soils from the results
              of in situ tests and n ew types of  laboratory tests.  After developing
              appropriate computational aspects utilizing  neural  networks to model behavior
              and using the FEM, a series of  experiments will  be conducted to simulate the
              in situ tests.  Unlike  conventional soils  tests, in the proposed method it is
              essential that the  sample be subjected  to a non uniform state of strain so
              that different points  within the sample  can be subjected to as many different
              stress paths as  possible.  New soils  tests, including a relatively simple
              punched test, will be  developed and  tested in the laboratory.  These results
              will be used to  train the neural  network.  The development of methodology and
              the  computational aspects will  be conducted at the University of Illinois. 
              The  experimental part of the  proposed research will be conducted at the Johns
              Hopkins  University.  ***          9503697  Lade  A new method will be
