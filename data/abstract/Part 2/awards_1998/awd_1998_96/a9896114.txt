Abstract    :
              9601519  Kraimeche, Belkacem  Cooper Union    Academic Research Infrastructure:
              Acquisition of an Automated VLSI Test Facility    This Academic Research
              Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of an automated VLSI testing
              facility to support research in VLSI design and test engineering.    The
              research projects supported by the equipment include ATM switching fabric
              designs for VLSI implementation, Systolic Array implementations of CODECs using
              innovative coding algorithms, and speech coding for wireless communications
              implemented in VLSI circuits.
