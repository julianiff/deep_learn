Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      OPP-9614537     OPP-9614557  NELSON, FREDERICK    BARRY, ROGER 
              STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK  UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO   AT ALBANY    This
              research project uses Global Circulation Models (GCMs) to derive climatic
              conditions in the permafrost region of the Arctic during predicted warmer
              climatic conditions. The model output for a warmer climate scenario will be
              used to predict the areas where permafrost could thaw and cause great
              disruption to human populations.  The disruption would greatly affect
              engineering practices, coastal erosion, as well as ecological changes that
              could affect subsistence economies. The results of this study will provide a
              framework for assessing potential impacts on the infrastructure and social
              culture of areas in the Arctic where global climate changes resulting from
              natural or  human activities have been predicted. The study will incorporate
              data from the Russian Arctic that has not been available previously.
