Abstract    :
                One of the great challenges facing today's software engineers  is the
              development of reliable systems, which are known to perform correctly in  all
              circumstances.  The most critical applications often involve concurrency and 
              real-time, which increase the difficulty of system development and validation. 
              Testing and debugging cannot prove a system is correct. However, they are 
              currently the most effective methods available for validating real
              applications.  This project investigates the use of oracles created from
              Graphical Interval  Logic (GIL) specifications in testing and debugging of
              real-time programs.  GIL is a visual logic for specifying  and reasoning about
              properties of real-time systems. The existing GIL tools  allow mechanical
              checking that system specifications guarantee critical  correctness
              requirements.  This project seeks to produce a method for relating  GIL
              specifications to real-time programs that permits deterministic finite-state 
              automata constructed from GIL specifications to be used in  verifying that 
              executions of a program are correct. When an execution violates a
              specification,  the associated oracle would construct a GIL formula describing
              a fault in the  execution. This formula would be displayed graphically,
              appropriately aligned  with an execution trace, to help the user see where in
              the trace the fault  occurred and the nature of the fault.    Formal methods
              must be automated if  software engineers are to use them in the development of
              real systems. The  implementation and experimental evaluation of prototypes is
              therefore an  important facet of this project, which combines analytical
              research on  formal methods with experimental research aimed at assessing the
              practical  utility of formal methods.
