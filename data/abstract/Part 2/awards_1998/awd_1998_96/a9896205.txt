Abstract    :
              Stevens  9623451   The Summer Grants Program of the Council on Undergraduate
              Research offers fellowships to student/faculty teams to conduct 10-week
              research projects at their home institutions.  This program helps to remedy a
              problem faced by students and faculty in which the institution cannot sustain
              an REU-Site and the student cannot reasonably travel to an REU-Site to
              participate in a research program.  Increases in resources available to CUR
              have slowed, creating particularly acute funding limitations in the
              Geosciences.  Among proposals in 1995, only 20% were funded, while at least
              three others would have been had the resources been available.  This award will
              provide base funding for   CUR-GEO, including sufficient funds to support three
              fellowships each year for three years.  In addition, NSF will match non-federal
              dollars raised by CUR up to the cost of three additional fellowships.  The
              matching funds are intended to encourage additional contributions to CUR-GEO. 
              The fellowship recipients will be selected by CUR through its established
              mechanisms.  Results will be presented in CUR-sponsored poster sessions at
              regional meetings of the Geological Society of America.
