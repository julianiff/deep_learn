              CTS-9423780 T. Kyle Vanderlick University of Pennsylvania   The focus of this
              proposal is to elucidate how surface chemistry and topography control the
              interactions between solids as they are into an out of  molecular contact.  The
              primary tool of our investigations is the surface forces apparatus, a device
              designed to measure the forces acting between two opposed surfaces as their
              separation is varied.  Recently, we extended the capabilities of the surface
              forces apparatus to new level with the development of Extended Spectral
              Analysis Multiple Beam Inteferometry (ESA-MBI).  This optical technique, which
              is used to determine surface separation, allow metals to be used as substrates
              in the surface force apparatus. In addition to breaking open the application of
              the surface forces apparatus to this important class of material, ESA-MBI
              boasts another advantage:  the technique provides information on the degree and
              form of surface roughness, in-situ, under states of stress that result when one
              surface is in contact with, or near to another.  We propose to take advantage
              the fundamental interac tions occurring across rough interfaces.  Such
              interfaces will be formed upon bringing two surfaces-one or both of them
              rough-into and out of molecular contact.  A particular focus of this research
              will be to study the contact, deformations, and adhesion between surfaces with
              different chemical and mechanical properties.  Our studies will take advantage
              of self-assembled monolayer formation as a vehicle for surface modification.
