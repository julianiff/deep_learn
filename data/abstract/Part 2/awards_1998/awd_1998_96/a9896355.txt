Abstract    :
              9530187  MONTOYA    Denitrification (=respiration of oxidized nitrogen to 
              dinitrogen  gas)  results  in  the  loss,  from the  biosphere,  of  combined 
              nitrogen, a critical nutrient for plant growth.  The magnitude of 
              denitrification  affects  the rates of decomposition  of  organic  matter in
              the water column.  Changes in these rates can alter the  balance between the
              amount of carbon that reaches the deep  ocean  and  the  amount of CO2
              available in the atmosphere.  The project  will  be  conducted in the Eastern
              Tropical North  Pacific  where  suitably  low  oxygen  waters persist.  Various
               measurements  of  denitrification   in  this  environment  will  address  
              research  questions  that are crucial to understanding nitrogen and  carbon 
              cycling  in  the  ocean.  State-of-practice N-15  techniques  and  isotope 
              ratio  mass  spectrometry  will  be  used  to  determine  dinitrification
              rates.    ***
