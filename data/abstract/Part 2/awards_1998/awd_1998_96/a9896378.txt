Abstract    :
                   This project studies the effects of exercise on bones,  focusing on the two
              most important processes by which bones  respond to loading:  (1) growth
              (modeling) in which a bone  increases its size, and (2) repair (Haversian
              remodeling) in  which bones replace old, damaged tissue.  Preliminary data 
              indicate that the relative percentage of growth versus  repair tends to vary
              within individuals inversely down the  limbs, with more growth occurring near
              the body's center and  more remodeling occurring distally.  It is proposed that
               growth preferentially occurs where there is a low cost to  additional mass
              increase, but that repair is favored in  regions such as the ends of the limb
              where mass increases  impose an exponentially higher energetic cost and which, 
              therefore, tend to be thinner and weaker.  Modulation of  growth versus repair
              responses to loading suggest that  different regions of the skeleton are
              adapted to tolerate  different strains levels.       This proposal has
              significance for anthropological,  palaeontological and other osteologcial
              research on humans  and other vertebrates.  Of special interest is testing the 
              hypothesis that recent, industrial-era  humans tend to have  overall thinner
              bones than hunter-gatherers and early  farmers because of generally low levels
              of mechanical  loading, particularly during childhood.
