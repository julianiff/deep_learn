Abstract    :
              9408287  Mabee  The central goal of the proposed research is to understand the
              development of the cranial skeleton in fishes.  Toward this goal, the PI will
              acquire data using experimental developmental techniques and synthesize these
              data using the methods of phylogenetic systematics.  The PI will use modern
              lineage tracing methods, with digital imaging techniques and video microscopy
              to assess the relative embryological contribution of placode and neural crest
              to dermal cranial bones.  This is significant because no hypotheses on the
              history of skeletal development in vertebrates can be made without information
              on fishes, and so far no experimental data on fishes are available.  This study
              will provide these data.
