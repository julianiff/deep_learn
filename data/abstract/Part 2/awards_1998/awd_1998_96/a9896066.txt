Abstract    :
              9502015  Wilhelm     The proposed research lies in the general area of
              Riemannian geometry. More specifically, the proposer wishes to find new
              examples of Riemannian manifolds with positive and negative sectional
              curvature, and to study various questions related to finiteness theorems; the
              proposer seeks to identify Riemannian manifolds by means of values of geometric
              invariants such as sectional curvature and packing radius.    This project is
              supported by the NSF's CAREER program, which emphasizes the development of full
              and balanced academic careers including both research and education. The
              education plan in this proposal aims to move away from the standard lecture
              format by having students give presentations in class and holding group
              discussions.
