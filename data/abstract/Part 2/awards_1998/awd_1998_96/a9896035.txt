Abstract    :
              Orchard         Efficient compression of video sequences should exploit the 
              high interframe redundancy due to the smoothness of motion fields  in typical
              scenes.  Current video coding algorithms use very  simplistic motion models,
              limiting the degree to which motion-  induced redundancy can be exploited in
              video coding.  This  research is investigating improved methods for estimating
              motion  in video sequences, and compensating for that motion to achieve 
              increased coding efficiency.  Methods are being considered which  estimate
              motion at the encoder, requiring transmission of motion  overhead, and as well
              as those which estimate motion directly at  the decoder.  The goal is to
              provide a unifyied framework for  these two approaches to motion estimation,
              and to develop hybrid  algorithms taking advantage of the best features of both
               approaches.
