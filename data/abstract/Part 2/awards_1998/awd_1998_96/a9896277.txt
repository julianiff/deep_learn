Abstract    :
              Human behavior is probabilistic.  Even in the simplest of tasks, some randomness
              or unpredictability creeps into human responses.  This makes it difficult to
              study the details of how people respond to subtly different stimuli.  To gain a
              good understanding of such responses, it is necessary to collect large amounts
              of data, which can be expensive and time-consuming.  This research seeks to
              develop new procedures for efficient data collection, and new methods for
              evaluating such procedures.  It applies information theory and the theory of
              stochastic processes to develop adaptive algorithms for extracting as much
              information as possible from experiments.  A particular test case for these
              methods will be experiments in visual psychophysics, which is notorious for
              requiring extremely long and numerous data-collection sessions.  However, the
              methods will be developed abstractly, in order to maximize their applicability
              to a wide range of problems, such as experiments in economics and the
              evaluation of reliability of electronic components.
