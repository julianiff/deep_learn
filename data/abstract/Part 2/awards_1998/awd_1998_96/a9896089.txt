Abstract    :
              Stixrude  9614790    This is a renewal proposal to continue theoretical studies
              of  iron and iron alloys under conditions of the earth's core.  The  PIs plan
              to expand their work into the evaluation of time-  dependent properties of the
              core, electromagnetic properties of  iron, and the properties of iron alloys. 
              They will also  continue to investigate the phase stability of iron, including 
              the melting curve which is crucial for constraining the  temperature of the
              core, and the sub-solidus phase diagram,  necessary to infer the crystalline
              structure of the inner core.  ***
