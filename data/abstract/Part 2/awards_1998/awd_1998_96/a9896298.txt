Abstract    :
              9706031  Liang  This one-year pilot project is a combined laboratory and
              numerical study of crystal growth and dissolution in the ternary CaO-Al2O3-SiO2
              system.  The study will address two major questions: (1) the role of coupled
              chemical diffusion in crystal growth and dissolution in molten silicate melts,
              and (2) the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium at the crystal-melt
              or mush-melt interface.  The laboratory experiments will involve material
              synthesis, determination of liquidus surfaces, diffusion controlled dissolution
              of single crystals and polycrystalline materials, and diffusion controlled
              dissolution of a crystal-melt mush, all at 1500oC and 1 GPa.  This study will
              set the stage for future studies of dissolution in more complicated systems and
              also for studies of free convection assisted dissolution.  Such studies have
              the potential  to elucidate large scale structure and dynamics of magma
              chambers,  small scale igneous textures, and models for mineral growth rates.
