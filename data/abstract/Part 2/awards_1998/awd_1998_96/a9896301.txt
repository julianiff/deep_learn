Abstract    :
              The three major aspects of this project are (1) comparison of CO2, water and
              energy fluxes in different vegetation types and climates, (2) evaluating the
              roles of water and energy fluxes as components of the coupled land-atmosphere
              system, and (3) determining the relative importance of soil, root, and
              aboveground components of net ecosystem CO2 flux.  Fluxes will be measured in
              with season-long fluxes measured in reference vegetation types by other
              projects. The role of water and energy fluxes in regional climate will assessed
              by land-surface model that can be coupled to a regional climate model. 
              Sensitivity analysis with this land-surface model will determine the major ways
              in which regional climate.  Labeling of soils with stable isotopes will be used
              to evaluate the relative importance of roots and soil in controlling CO2 flux
              from tundra. These experiments will be coordinated with measurements of soil
              organic matter content and quality and of ecosystem CO2 flux made by other
              projects in the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions
              Flux Study.
