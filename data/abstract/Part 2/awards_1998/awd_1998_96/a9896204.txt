Abstract    :
              9410302  Kerk  This Research Initiation Award involves the application of 
              biomechanical models in the field of ergonomics toward the  goal of reducing
              human pain and suffering, reducing costs  associated with work-related
              accidents and overexertion  injuries, and reducing production costs by
              improving work  place design.  The specific objectives are to: complete the 
              theoretical development of the three-dimensional, static,  biomechanical model
              combining the comprehensive effects of  strength capability, stability, and
              coefficient of friction,  develop the computer software to evaluate the model
              by  mathematical programming methods to deliver numerical  solution, perform
              bench top evaluation of the model, and  facilitate industry interaction and
              classroom evaluation of  the model to assure the relevancy of the research.   
              This research has potential utility for any situation in  which humans exert
              forces on an external environment.  Potential settings will be found in
              industry, aiding the  disabled, rehabilitating injured workers, and athletic 
              performance.  ***
