Abstract    :
              9317379  Foster  This project is study of the deep and bottom water formation 
              processes of the antarctic continental shelf off Wilkes Land  between 145 deg E
              longitude and 160 deg E longitude.  The project  is to be carried out jointly
              with an Australian oceanographic  project.    Preliminary work in 1985 has
              shown that hydrographic sections in  this area are quite similar to those of
              known deep water formation  regions in the southern Weddell Sea.  This project
              will include the  year-long deployment of six current meter moorings, and
              tracer  studies (oxygen, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, stable  isotopes,
              and nutrients) to test whether shelf waves and tides are  the principal
              mechanism for mixing shelf water with the off-shore  intermediate water.    Two
              oceanographic cruises are planned for this work: a cruise of  the RVIB
              Nathaniel B. Palmer in February 1995, and a cruise of the  Australian ship R/V
              Aurora Australis in February 1996.  ***
