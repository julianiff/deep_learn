Abstract    :
              9726045  Blum  This workshop would bring together experts from several fields to
              develop reasonable protocols for handling authority files that are needed to
              efficiently computerize natural history data.  The absence of the protocols and
              therefore the files themselves has hampered the development of biodiversity
              informatics.  WWW access to such data is critically needed by decision-makers
              and scientists both nationally and internationally.  This workshop project
              represents a strong partnership among the Bishop Museum, the USGS/Biological
              Resources Division, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System project, and
              the digital libraries and natural history collections communities.  Careful
              planning will be undertaken by all concerned parties so that the results of the
              workshop will be concrete and will further the development of a biodiversity
              informatics infrastructure for the U.S., which will in turn be part of a global
              biodiversity informatics infrastructure.
