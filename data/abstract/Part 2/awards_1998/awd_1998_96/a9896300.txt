Abstract    :
              9624363  Chen   This Career Award provides support for research on developing a
              design system, called the Concept Exploration System (CES), for configuring
              complex systems at the early stages of design.  The CES can be used to quickly
              evaluate the design concepts and determine the top-level design specifications
              for those systems that require a large investment of resources, have long life
              cycles, have small production runs and are generally made-to-order.  Examples
              of such systems are aircraft, automobiles, launch vehicles, ships, and electric
              power generation plants.  The foundation of this research is the development of
              the Robust Concept Exploration Method which is an integrated design process
              that allows for decision making with quality consideration.  The key feature of
              this method is to integrate the robust design techniques, Suh's design axioms,
              and the Response Surface Methodology within the framework of the Compromise
              Decision Support Problem (a mathematical construct for formulating
              multi-objective design problems involving tradeoffs).  Educational focal points
              are to (1) orchestrate learning from a systems perspective in the undergraduate
              design education, (2) introduce quality engineering concepts and statistical
              methods in the graduate design curricula, and (3) encourage undergraduate
              student involvement with the research programs.   Because of growing costs and
              globalization of the marketplace, improvements in productivity require a
              reliable design in the shortest possible time.  In general, most design
              automation techniques have concentrated on relatively later design phases but
              little has been done to provide assistance in the early stages of design.  The
              development of this research will provide a prototypical tool that can be used
              by designers to do better in this area of design and ultimately enhance the
              competitiveness of American industry.  Successful implementation of the
              research is expected to affect the science and technology base in providing the
              capability of handling  design problems with a magnitude of complexity,
              reducing the risks of using uncertain information, facilitating continuous
              improvement, and assisting Concurrent Engineering and Multidisciplinary
              Optimization.
