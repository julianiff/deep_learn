Abstract    :
                    9619324  Horwitz  Summary:  The project works with 200 teachers over two
              years to develop a scripting tool that teachers could use in conjunction with a
              previously NSF funded product, GenScope.  Participating teachers are drawn from
              Boston Public Schools and the seventeen neighboring districts.  In the first
              year, the project explores how teachers can use scripts and what parameters
              would make a scripting tool most useful for them.  In the second year, a full
              prototype is tested with the teachers.  Teachers are offered workshops,
              in-class assistance, and internetworked support services.  Through this project
              they can create their own computer-based activities running in conjunction with
              GenScope.  Cost sharing is 1%.
