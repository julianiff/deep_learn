Abstract    :
              This research investigates manipulation tasks with arrays of  micro 
              electromechanical structures  (MEMS).   The  PIs  are  developing  a  geometric
              model for the  mechanics  of  micro  actuators  and  a theory of massively
              parallel manipulation,  and  will develop efficient algorithms for their
              evaluation.  They    have   designed,   built,   and   tested   prototype 
              microfabricated  actuators,  and  will  demonstrate  control  strategies  to
              manipulate small objects. In particular,  the  research  will  develop  and
              implement  sensorless  actuator  array control strategies to efficiently orient
              flat parts in  the  plane. The main objective of the research concerns  the 
              development  of a science base for micro-scale manipulation.  Manipulation 
              strategies  with  reduced  sensing  have  been  highly  successful  in 
              industrial  manufacturing,  e.g.  in  vibratory bowl feeders, or in systems
              such as the Sony  APOS  system.   These  strategies will be extended  to  the 
              micro  scale.   A dense array of devices can be modeled as a vector  field. 
              The flow this field induces on a rigid body will  be  analyzed  to  develop, 
              evaluate, and  extend  a  theory  of  manipulation with micro-actuator arrays. 
              It will  be  shown  how  simple  actuator  control strategies  can  be  used 
              to  uniquely  orient  a  part  up  to  symmetry  without  sensor  feedback. The
              manipulation algorithms are based on a  theory  of programmable vector fields,
              which is applicable to a wide  range of micro-actuator arrays. The algorithms
              will be  impl  emented  on  physical micro-arrays to validate  the  theory. 
              Strategies  for  orienting, sorting, and  singulating  parts  using 
              micro-arrays  will  be  designed,  implemented,   and  tested.
