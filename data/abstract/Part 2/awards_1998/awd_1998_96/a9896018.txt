Abstract    :
              9415923  Villareal         This proposal will address a fundamental problem in 
              biological oceanography format he viewpoint that vertically  migrating algal
              mats in the open ocean are instrumental in  redistributing nitrogen within  the
               surface waters of the  North Pacific Ocean.  Using previously funded shiptime,
              the  project will documents Rhizosolenia mat vertical  distribution throughout
              the upper 100-300 m, the  quantitative N inputs, and potential for NO3-release
              in the  surface layers by mats in the central North Pacific gyre.  The research
              will characterize depth of origin, migration  times and absolute transport
              rates by these macroscopic  associations and determine if NO3-release by mat
              decay is  taken up by other ambient phytoplankton.  In addition, the  study
              will survey other phytoplankton that may be vertical  migrators such as
              Ethmodiscus, Pyrocystis, Halospaera and  solitary Phizosolenia to determine if
              they are also  important components of this process.  At the conclusion of  the
              study, the project will have examined waters of the  central North pacific gyre
              both east and west of Hawaii.  This should lead to a broad spatial
              understanding of the  importance of phytoplankton vertical migration in the 
              oceanic waters of the North Pacific gyre.
