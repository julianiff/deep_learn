Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  LI  9622275    The PI proposes to develop a numerical model of
              transport processes and microstructure formation in an
              electromagnetically-stirred solidification process.  The numerical model
              complements an ongoing experimental effort in the PI?s laboratory. 
              Understanding the fundamental processes is important in casting of fine-grained
              high-purity aluminum for electronic applications and high strength aluminum
              alloys for aerospace applications.
