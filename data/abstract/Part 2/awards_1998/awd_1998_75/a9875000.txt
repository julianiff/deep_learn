This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State
              University for a program of research with the Tevatron proton-antiproton
              collider at Fermilab and with the proton-proton Large Hardron Collider (LHC) at
              the CERN Laboratory in Geneva Switzerland.  The proposed research program uses
              the D0 detector at Fermilab and the ATLAS detector at the LHC.  Harry Weerts, a
              Co-PI is a co-spokesman of the D0 collaboration.  Members of the MSU group
              formed the nucleus of the original D0 collaboration, and the group has major
              hardware responsibility for upgrading the fast trigger system.  The MSU group
              has also assumed responsibility for the design and construction of elements of
              the fast trigger system of the ATLAS detector.
