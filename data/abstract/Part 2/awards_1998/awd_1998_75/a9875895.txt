This is the final part of a three-stage project whose goal
              is to compile
comprehensive reference dictionaries of Arikara and two dialects
              of Pawnee,
Skiri and South Band, closely related Caddoan languages spoken
              today by
fewer than a half dozen elderly tribal members in North Dakota
              and
Oklahoma.  The project will produce databases from which dictionaries
              will
be generated in both printed and multimedia computer formats.

In stage
              1, the PI established the dictionary databases on computer and
conducted
              fieldwork on all three dialects.  In stage 2, using Microsoft's
Visual FoxPro,
              the project developed a new multimedia dictionary database
program for
              dictionary development.  The PI reviewed and sound recorded in
digital format
              all entries and examples in the databases, and the sound
recordings were
              incorporated into the databases. 

Stage 3, the current project, has three
              primary goals:  (1) developing a
text processing database software program
              that will be linked to the
dictionary database program and will enable
              linguists to prepare texts in
parsed interlinear format and to import words,
              phrases, and sentences into
the dictionary databases;  (2) incorporating a
              sound component into the
text processor database, linking spoken text (as
              sounded recorded on tape)
with written text; and (3) entering collections of
              Arikara and Pawnee texts
into the program and importing material from the
              texts into the dictionary
databases.

Project software programs will serve
              as computer tools that provide
linguists with efficient means of analyzing,
              manipulating, and presenting
large bodies of data.  They offer a model of
              presentation that will
establish a new standard in endangered language
              documentation.
