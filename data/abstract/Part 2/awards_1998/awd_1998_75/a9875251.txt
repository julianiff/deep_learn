Abstract    :
                   The overall goals of this CAREER project are to advance fundamental
              knowledge leading to higher productivity of ceramics grinding and to improve
              the problem solving abilities of undergraduate and graduate students.  The
              superior properties of ceramics make them a desirable material for many
              applications.  However, the fabrication cost of ceramic components is often
              prohibitive.  One of the problems occurs in the grinding of ceramics, where the
              rapid degradation of the grinding wheel hinders surface quality and production
              rate.  The research objectives of this project are to improve grinding wheel
              effectiveness through the use of high-frequency vibrations as a means of
              in-process cleaning of the wheel; and, the use of an abrasive waterjet as an
              in-process cleaning and dressing technique.   Both analysis and experimentation
              will be used to evaluate the effect of high-frequency vibrations on the
              performance of individual grains as well as the grinding wheel.  In addition,
              the interaction between a high-pressure waterjet (with and without entrained
              abrasive) and a grinding wheel will be investigated.  The education part of
              this project will introduce problem-based learning concepts in the classroom. 
              Techniques for solving open-ended practical problems will be introduced in an
              undergraduate class, and experimental exercises will be developed in a
              problem-solving project course for graduate students.
     The potential
              impact of the project includes improved methods for fracture-free grinding of
              ceramics, new scientific knowledge on the effect of high-frequency vibrations
              on the grinding process as well as on the interaction between a high-pressure
              waterjet and a grinding wheel, and the education of undergraduate and graduate
              students in practical problem solving.
