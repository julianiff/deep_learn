This CAREER award supports
              interdisciplinary research on the development of enabling technology for the
              next generation of electronic brokerages.  In the future, electronic brokerages
              must ideally provide time-cognizant, pro-active and innovative services based
              on complex user preferences similar to those expressed in verbal communication.
               This research focuses on developing the theoretical foundations and a
              methodology to (a) develop user interface to specify complex preferences
              interactively, (b) translate preferences into appropriate processing
              specifications, (c) develop efficient algorithms to detect, update and cancel
              events in a timely manner, and (d) design mechanisms that efficiently bind
              actions to event/condition detection.  A software architecture will be
              developed to create component-based functional packages that can be plugged
              into commercial databases.  In addition, this research proposes an innovative
              approach to integrate economic principles into brokerage design tp provide the
              optimal service quality and to integrate the role of user trust.  The findings,
              validated by Java-based proff-of-concept software prototypes, will help create
              arobust and reliable brokerages for advanced electronic commerce applications. 
              the Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER proposal includes the
              development of information technology and domain-related courses.  These
              courses will deal with the  design of domain-specific electronic brokerages and
              experimentation with new business models in the electronic environment.
