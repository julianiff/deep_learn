New research frontiers bridging the gap between organic and
              inorganic activity at scales ranging from molecular to global and societal
              issues such as environmental geochemistry and global change have inspired the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia to
              target biogeochemistry as its path to a nationally recognized program.  Recent
              hires in organic geochemistry, geomicrobiology, and paleoceanography were
              chosen to complement existing expertise in aqueous and stable isotope
              geochemistry, hydrogeology, sedimentology, oceanography, and paleontology.  As
              a leader in the biogeochemistry group, I intend to address our most tangible
              need, more and better doctoral students, in the context of a multifaceted
              strategy to develop and promote our new agenda.  I have defined a research
              program to support students in efforts to extrapolate exciting results from
              ongoing studies of modern anoxic marine basins to address fundamental questions
              in a classic ancient shale sequence, the Pennsylvanian cyclothems of
              mid-continent North America.  Highlighting innovative approaches to isotope
              chemostratigraphy and the controls on carbon cycling, iron sulfide formation,
              and trace-metal partitioning across well-defined gradients in paleoredox will
              extend the implications of this study far beyond regional significance.
