Abstract    :
              My career-development plan is centered around two themes that serve to combine
              my research and educational projects within the University of Connecticut's new
              Coastal Studies program at Avery Point.  The first theme focuses on
              visually-oriented techniques as tools to enhance learning and advance research,
              and the second theme focuses on laboratory-based learning programs that will
              enhance and strengthen both the undergraduate and graduate experience.  My
              research initiatives will examine interactions between aggregated material
              (flocs, marine snow), and suspension-feeding, marine animals that live on the
              bottom.  I will study whether bottom animals feed on particle aggregates and
              whether they release mucus during the normal feeding process that may affect
              how flocs form near the bottom.  Many of my research techniques can be used as
              teaching tools to promote hands-on learning by undergraduate students (e.g.,
              video microscopy, electronic particle counters, image analysis, video
              endoscopy) and will have immediate payoffs by providing opportunities for
              undergraduate research in my laboratory.  In addition, my educational
              initiatives focus on hands-on learning and include developing three projects:
              (1) a video-ready teaching laboratory; (2) research experiences for
              undergraduates; and (3) a graduate student seminar that focuses on preparation
              for academic life.  My research and teaching initiatives for graduate and
              undergraduate students will serve as a model for other faculty members at Avery
              Point and, with their support, allow me to build a comprehensive program.
