Abstract    :
              The principal investigator proposes to study the binary fluid absorption in wavy
              falling films and droplets.  Analytical and experimental techniques will be
              used to account for the effects of countercurrent vapor shear, capillary
              pressure differences due to film curvature variations and surface tension
              gradients, and instability driven droplet-mode absorption between tubes.  Image
              processing of film thickness video and film thickness probe data will be used
              to develop time-dependent traces of smooth and wavy films, including wave
              amplitude, frequency, and celerity.  Droplet formation sites, size
              distributions and velocities, and the effect of vapor shear on thickness, wave
              structure, and droplet entrainment will be determined from momentum balances
              validated by direct measurements.

The work will provide a consistent
              analytical, numerical and experiment treatment of the hydrodynamics and heat
              and mass transfer in absorption.  The understanding gained from the research
              will be used to develop a miniaturization technology for heat and mass
              exchangers and will result in compact, modular designs to help mitigate
              ozone-depletion.
