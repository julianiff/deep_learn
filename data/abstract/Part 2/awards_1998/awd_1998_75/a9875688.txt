The networking research community has recently become
              intrigued with the possibility of offer-ing differentiated service types which
              are dynamically priced to enc~6rage favorable consumption of network resources.
              It is widely speculated but far from clear that pricing can serve as a means of
              congestion control (packet regulation) as well as a means of cost recovery for
              infrastructure providers.  This work will explore the former assertion. Current
              mechanisms for the control of packet flows, while often justified by hard
              engineering anal-ysis, are ad hoc in the sense that they are not conceived as
              solutions to stochastic optimal control problems.  Learning is based mechanisms
              may be useful in coping with and differentiated services. 

The research
              objectives of this proposal are twofold:

1. to develop technological
              mechanisms for packet regulation based on stochastic optimal control and to
              establish the general applicability of this perspective in networking through
              mathe-matical and computational analysis, and

2.  to mitigate the effect of
              computational complexity in solving real-world stochastic optimal control
              problems and to promote the development of practical learning based
              computational methods.

The education objectives of this proposal are

1.
              to provide a vehicle by which undergraduate and graduate students will
              learn
general approaches to research: modeling, optimization, analysis, and
              design; and
specific technological expertise: stochastic optimal control,
              computational methods, and
the cutting edge of data communications, and

2. 
              to disseminate the results of the proposed research to as broad an audience as
              possible, including the telecommunications industry.
