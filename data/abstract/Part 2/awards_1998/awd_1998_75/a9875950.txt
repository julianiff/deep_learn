Abstract    :
              Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) technology has numerous uses in voice-based
              information retrieval, desktop computer interfaces, language training, and a
              host of other applications.  However, TTS systems are not yet used in many
              appropriate applications because their output quality is not acceptable to the
              average user.  Funding for investigation of speech synthesis techniques in the
              United States has dwindled over the past several years.  This has led to a
              slowing of progress in synthesis, and a a limiting of the scope of all speech
              technology education.  This work will impact the broader scope of interactive
              systems research by (i) developing new speech synthesis techniques that allow
              more natural-sounding speech synthesis, and (ii) supporting the training of new
              investigators with a unique mix of expertise in signal processing, statistical
              modeling, and linguistic sciences.  Course curricula, exercises, and freely
              distributed software tools will be developed to aid in this educational
              innovation.  Research on data-driven signal processing techniques will strive
              to improve the quality of current TTS algorithms.  The results of this research
              will be evaluated at multiple levels, and will impact interactive systems
              research and education at multiple sites throughout the world, aided by their
              distribution in the CSLU Toolkit.
