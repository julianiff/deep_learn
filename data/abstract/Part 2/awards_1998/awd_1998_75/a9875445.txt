Abstract    :
                   This CAREER award integrates research into a novel method to perform solid
              freeform fabrication (SFF) with a broad educational plan to advance the
              fundamentals of SFF to students and industry personnel.  The focus of the
              research is to design and build a solid freeform fabrication system based on a
              novel method for fabrication of parts and assemblies by layer by layer
              deposition of powder, where the powder is deposited using electrophotography. 
              In this approach, two types of powders, a part powder and a support powder are
              deposited layer-by-layer into a die such that the part powder has the shape of
              the desired part and is surrounded by support powder.  Subsequent compaction
              and sintering will consolidate and fuse the part powder to high density and
              strength while the support material remains in powder form.  Advantages of this
              approach include the ability to use a wide range of materials, print powder in
              gray scales, mix powders in a controlled fashion, create composition gradients
              within the part and embed electronics into parts by printing circuits.         
               The educational plan involves developing a design studio and creating new
              teaching tools and course materials to modernize the curriculum in the areas of
              computer-integrated design, analysis and SFF manufacturing.  The design studio
              envisioned will consist of a networked computational facility equipped with
              design and analysis software as well as rapid-prototyping and numerical
              controlled machining equipment to provide hands-on experience in integrated
              design and rapid manufacturing.
