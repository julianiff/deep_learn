Some apparently normal children inexplicably have
              difficulty acquiring
language.  Specific language impairment (SLI) is the term
              for severe
developmental delays in the production and/or comprehension
              of
language that do not seem to be due to hearing loss, mental
retardation,
              motor deficits, neurological or psychiatric disorders, or
lack of exposure to
              language.  In this project, three types of studies
will be conducted on
              normally-developing and SLI children: 1) analyses
of longitudinal spontaneous
              speech samples; 2) analyses of
cross-sectional elicited speech samples; and 3)
              analyses of imitated
sentences that systematically vary in phonological,
              syntactic and
lexical complexity.  Through careful analyses of these data, we
              will
address the following questions:

*  What is the nature of the
              linguistic deficit(s) in SLI?
*  To what extent are some components of
              language (e.g., syntax, phonology,
	lexicon) spared relative to others in SLI?
               
*  To what extent do performance factors play a role in SLI children's
              
	deficits?  To what extent does SLI and normal children's performance
	on
              language tasks degrade as performance load increases?
*  Do SLI and normal
              children have a single (limited) pool of performance
	resources for all
              language tasks, or does each subcomponent of
	language have its own dedicated
              resources? Does increased performance
	load in one area of language lead to
              decreased performance in just
	that area or in other areas of language as
              well?
