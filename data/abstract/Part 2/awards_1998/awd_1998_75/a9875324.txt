Embedded cores are being increasingly used in
              large system-on-a-chip (SOC) designs. These complex, pre-designed functional
              blocks facilitate design reuse, allow greater on-chip functionality, and lead
              to shorter product development cycles. However, the increased use of cores has
              greatly exacerbated the testing problem. This research is directed at several
              fundamental issues in core testing using precomputed tests. In order to
              maintain intellectual property, core vendors do not reveal implementation
              details; instead they only provide precomputed test sets, which must be
              effectively utilized by the system designer. Research activities being carried
              out under this grant include: (1) Built-in generation of precomputed test sets
              for at-speed core testing; (2) Synthesis techniques for increasing transparency
              and test access, and the design of transparent space compactors for non-modeled
              faults; (3) Design of efficient test access architectures and optimal test
              scheduling for core-based systems.
