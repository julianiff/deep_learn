A core scientific issue for our understanding of biodiversity
              on the planet is how the biological processes that generate differences among
              individuals within and among populations translate into the differences we see
              among species.  Reproductive isolation is one of the most important biological
              processes for creating and maintaining this biodiversity diversity. When
              individuals from different populations do not mate then the populations can
              evolve independently and potentially create new species. The Hawaiian
              picture-winged flies and Hawaiian Drosophila in general are a highly speciose
              group of animals with over 500 species that are found only in the Hawaiian
              Islands. The fragmentation of suitable habitat due to lava flows and variable
              climates across the island restricts the distribution of species into many
              isolated populations. This study will use molecular genetic techniques to
              compare the degree of genetic isolation to the degree of reproductive isolation
              among populations in these different habitats.  The understanding of these
              biological processes will influence management strategies for conservation
              biology in Hawaii and across the planet.

The Hawaiian Islands and especially
              the Big Island of Hawaii offer unique opportunities to investigate the
              formation and maintenance of biodiversity.  Approximately 81% of the birds, 89%
              of the flowering plants and 99% of the terrestrial invertebrates are native
              only to the Hawaiian Islands. Many of these animals and plants are threatened
              or in danger of extinction. The unique animals and plants coupled with the
              highly fragmented populations of many species provide the islands with
              difficult challenges for the conservation of biological diversity. This project
              will be integrated into an ecology, evolution and conservation biology program
              being developed at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. The integration of
              research and education in the general area of environmental biology is vital to
              the preservation of Hawaii's biodiversity.
