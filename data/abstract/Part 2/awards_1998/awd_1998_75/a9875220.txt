Abstract    :
              Metz is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to use
              photofragment spectroscopy to characterize the metal-producing reactions, 
              products, and reaction intermediates for reactions of gas-phase transition
              metal cations and metal oxide cations with simple hydrocarbons.  The goals of
              this effort are to determine the structure and thermochemistry of the ground
              and low-lying excited electronic states of these species.  In addition, he will
              use an optical double-resonance approach to characterize bonding in the ground
              electronic state of transition metal reaction intermediates.  The educational
              and outreach aspects of this CAREER award include participating in general
              chemistry curricular reform, modernizing the undergraduate physical chemistry
              laboratory, and mentoring students from underrepresented groups. 

Chemists
              have long sought practical approaches to breaking bonds in alkanes under mild
              reaction conditions, an elusive goal.  Outcomes from the research effort are
              expected to provide aspects of the basic understanding necessary to achieve
              this goal. Sucessful outcomes from the educational plan will improve the
              precollege and undergraduate science learning experience.
