Logic emulation systems provide an essential tool for the
              design of complex circuits, but there are significant obstacles to design of
              the mapping software that translates designs to the emulator.  Such obstacles
              limit the potential to use logic emulation to simulate designs.  This research
              is exploring new algorithms, distributed computing techniques, and
              quality/performance tradeoffs needed to increase the performance of the mapping
              software.  The project is also developing a publicly available mapping flow to
              aid research into these systems, as well as set of large, realistic benchmark
              circuits.  Finally, methods for integrating these devices into logic design
              curricula, allowing for near-speed execution of student designs, and much more
              realistic design experiences are being pursued.
