The human brain
              has over 10 billion neurons, which are connected to produce an extremely
              complex anatomy. Adding greatly to this complexity are a large number of small
              and very potent chemicals. The distribution and total number of the
              neurochemicals is not yet known, and the functions of the major chemicals are
              only now being discovered. One of the largest groups of nervous system
              signaling molecules are peptides. The largest group of these peptides-with
              several hundred different sequences that are found in all animals-are called
              FMRFamide-like peptides or FLPs. The name "FMRFamide" is from the amino acids
              that make up the peptide. FLPs have a wide range of functions, including such
              things as modulation of the actions of opiates in mammals, various
              cardiovascular effects in mollusks and mammals, and both contraction and
              relaxation of muscle in roundworms.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy, molecular biology, protein chemistry, and computational
              techniques will be used to study the structures of FLPs under a variety of
              conditions. These studies are in parallel with colleagues studying the
              functions of the same peptides. Through the combined efforts more will learned
              about the structural and functional basis of the large numbers of these nervous
              system peptides, including how they interact with receptors, how they are
              produced in the cell, and how groups of related peptides create different
              signals.

The educational plan is to utilize the National High Magnetic Field
              Laboratory as an educational resource. This will increase the use of this
              specialized instrumentation and training of scientists in its use. A short
              course on biological NMR and created a website is available and expansion of
              this course and website is planned.
