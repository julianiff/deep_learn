Abstract
Engineering
              systems that require ultra-precision control of positions and shapes often use
              active materials as extremely precise actuators.  Many active materials respond
              to applied electric fields, which are conventionally applied by distributed
              electrodes.  In this investigation active material actuator technology is
              combined with an electron gun charge deposition system and the characteristics
              of the resulting shape and position control system explored.  The electron gun
              approach permits extremely accurate placement of control charges on the active
              material, thus making it possible to command strains and displacements at
              extremely precise locations in a piezoelectric structure.  The overall
              technical objective is the development of a thorough understanding of electron
              gun shape control of piezoelectric materials, including possible shape control
              limits, resolution, and dynamic behavior.  Both analytical and computation
              models are being developed and verified with experimental data.  The companion
              educational objective is to use the scientific investigation, which has
              significant mechanical, electrical, and control engineering components, to
              expose as many students as possible to the inherently multidisciplinary nature
              of modern engineering.
An actuation system that has the potential to be
              controllable at the nanometer level is explored in this research.  Potential
              applications for the technology developed in this project include active
              optics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and micromanufacturing, which are all
              high value-added emerging industries.  Training of students at the graduate,
              undergraduate, and secondary levels is also a product of this work-a product
              that naturally adds to domestic capabilities in math, science, and
              engineering.
