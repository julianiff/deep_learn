Abstract    :
              The proposed research is to design, construct and characterized suitable
              diffractive optical elements (DOE) for use as optical interconnects
              monolithically integrated in VLSL circuits and hence significantly improve
              system performance of high level computing systems.  The project has both
              experimental and theoretical aspects.  Experimentaly meso-scopic diffractive
              optical elements and VLSI circuits will be designed and fabricated. 
              Theoretical simulation using both boundary elements methods (BEM) and finite
              difference-time domain method (FDTD) will be performed.  The educational
              component of the proposal is to integrate research into undergraduate courses
              which will require research participation and presentation of results by
              students.
