Abstract    :
              The objective of this CAREER project is to take advantage of China's economic
              transition to investigate the relationship between social connections,
              financial market development, and economic outcomes. Three separate studies are
              planned. The first examines the relationship between social connections and the
              structure of interorganizational financial exchange relations in the early
              stages of financial market development. The second study tests a structural
              explanation for firm productivity and financial performance during market
              emergence, predicting that firm behavior and outcomes will reflect the
              structure of exchange relations--particularly those grounded in personal
              connections--found in an emerging financial market. The third study examines
              the relationship between financial market development and aggregate economic
              growth, testing the idea that China's economic growth in the absence of a
              financial market has been possible due to the development of informal financial
              market substitutes based on strong social relations. For all of these projects,
              network data will be collected on the financial exchange relations and firm
              financial performance, along with additional interview data on state-owned
              specialty banks and the central bank, case study data on the process by which
              firms and banks make financial strategy decisions, and secondary data on growth
              and other financial market indicators. The education plan includes the
              development of two courses, one for graduate students and one for
              undergraduates, that also explore the extent to which the structure of
              relationships among actors is useful in explaining economic behavior.
