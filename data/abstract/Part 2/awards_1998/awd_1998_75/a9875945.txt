This project studies techniques for solving combinatorial
              optimization problems with an emphasis on problems from CAD/VLSI. The approach
              is through developing a local search paradigm. In a local search algorithm a
              solution (for instance a standard cell placement) is iteratively improved by a
              sequence of moves or perturbations; the set of allowable moves defines the
              neighborhood structure of the algorithm (for example, pair-wise swapping in
              cell placement). This research studies classes of neighborhood operators with
              more expansive solution space coverage than traditional techniques. One such
              class is based on constraint relaxation. Operators with exponentially large
              neighborhoods are of particular interest. An orthogonal topic is the use of
              "meta-heuristics" in which a local-search engine can be viewed as a subroutine.
              Here we explore and evaluate experimentally more sophisticated techniques which
              attempt to focus on promising portions of the solution space. The research
              includes the archiving and analysis of known solutions to various optimization
              problems. Such known solutions are being studied via statistical and
              visualization techniques toward the end of finding superior optimization
              algorithms by better understanding of the nature of local optima of a
              particular problem. An in-depth study of the cell placement problem is being
              used as a testbed for these techniques.
