This CAREER project  aims to explore the electronic transport
              and superconductivity in anisotropic intermetallic compounds, such as high-Tc
              cuprates and organic conductors.  Infrared spectroscopy  will be used as the
              primary experimental tool. Instrumental innovations which the PI has recently
              implemented allow for a series of ambitious experiments which the technical
              limitations of standard infrared equipment had previously rendered impossible.
              Specific goals of the proposed research include:  i) a detailed survey of the
              phase diagrams of cuprate  high-Tc superconductors and of  two-dimensional (2D)
              organic compounds; ii) an investigation of possible fundamental differences
              between electron-doped and hole-doped cuprates;  iii) a survey of the
              interlayer electrodynamics in cuprates and organic compounds. Experimental work
              is closely linked to educational activities focused on the development of an
              undergraduate  program in Materials Physics at UCSD.

This CAREER program
              combines research and educational activities in Materials Physics. The research
              component is focused on the systematic investigations of the exotic electronic 
              properties of several classes of intermetallic superconductors by means of
              infrared spectroscopy. A series of ambitious  experiments will help to resolve
              the key issues related to new physics of unconventional superconductivity. The
              educational part supports the development of a new undergraduate program aimed
              to  prepare students for a career  in industry. An analysis of the job market
              indicates that there is a demand for  graduates with specialization in
              Materials Physics and with  a solid science background.  The new program seeks
              to facilitate a tight  link between local industry and the educational process.
