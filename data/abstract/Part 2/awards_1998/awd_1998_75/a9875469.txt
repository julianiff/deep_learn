CAREER:
              Physics-Based Robotic Manipulation Planning and Control

This is the first
              year flitiding of a four-year continuing award. The goal of this research is to
              develop robot manipulation planners and controllers which exploit task
              mechanics. The effective use of friction, gravity, and dynamic forces can
              substitute for extra actuators, allowing the development of inexpensive,
              minimalist robots. The ideas will be applied to problems in (1) industrial
              parts feeding, where the manipulation planner will allow a simple two-joint
              robot which can push and roll parts to position and orient three-dimensional
              parts on a conveyor, and (2) motion planning for human-robot collaborative
              manipulation. A collaborative robot is a passive programmable constraint
              machine which sets up virtual guiding surfaces to assist a human in
              manipulation tasks. The problem is to find "ergonomically correct" guides ---
              of all the guides that lead the object to the goal configuration, which makes
              the task easiest for the human? It will be investigated in the context of
              repetitive tasks in auto assembly. This work toward accessible, minimalist
              robotics will be complemented by the development of two new courses. The first
              is a fresbman/sophomore-level mechatronics design course which will make use of
              the mechatronics design lab currently under development. This course and the
              lab will allow undergraduates to get involved in research and independent
              projects early in their careers. The second course is a senior/graduate-level
              course on mechanics and algorithms for robotic manipulation and industrial
              automation.
