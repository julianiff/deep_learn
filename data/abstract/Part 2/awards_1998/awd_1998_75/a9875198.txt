Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Mark W. Grinstaff of the Department of Chemistry at the Duke
              University.   The research aims to develop a new automated solid-phase method
              for the synthesis of novel metallo-assemblies and metallo-dendrimers, and to
              systematically study the energy/electron transfer reactions in these
              nanostructures.   Variables to be investigated include distance between donors
              and acceptors, thermodynamic driving force, polymer composition, and polymer
              sequence.   The understanding developed in this project could find uses in
              biochemistry, pharmacology, biology and engineering, including the conversion
              of solar energy into stored chemical energy.
The educational part of the work
              includes  hands-on experiences for high school students in university chemistry
              laboratories, and a new advanced general chemistry course based on solid-state 
              materials.   Students working with the PI will gain valuable skills in the
              areas of metallo-organic synthesis, polymer characterization, electro
              chemistry, and photochemistry.
