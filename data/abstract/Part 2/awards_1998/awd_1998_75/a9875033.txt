This CAREER proposal describes a Research Plan devoted to the
              design of artificial lung tissue that will be used to study a class of
              molecules called S-nitrosothiols (RS-NO), and a Teaching Plan devoted to the
              incorporation of Problem-Based Learning into the engineering curriculum. RS-NO
              compounds can be inhaled, and hold promise as a potential source of nitric
              oxide to lung tissue.  Nitric oxide can relax smooth muscle in the lung, and
              this feature is beneficial to several important diseases such as asthma and
              Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  The objectives of the project are
              to: 1) engineer and characterize a model of lung tissue which can be used to
              study physical and chemical properties of biological molecules,  2)
              characterize the chemistry RS-NO in lung tissue including the effect of active
              disease, and 3) design therapeutic strategies which optimize the concentration
              of nitric oxide at smooth muscle sites following the inhalation of  RS-NO.
              Completion of the Research Plan will not only provide the pivotal information
              necessary to fully investigate the therapeutic potential of RS-NO in the
              treatment of inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma, but will also
              provide an important model system that can be used in a wide range of future
              airway studies. 

The main objective of the Teaching Plan is the
              incorporation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) techniques into the undergraduate
              and graduate engineering curriculum.  PBL is a method that allows not only the
              acquisition of basic facts and laws associated with the discipline, but
              strongly encourages the development of less tangible, but perhaps more
              important, skills of the practicing engineer which include reasoning, judgment,
              and innovation.  Secondary objectives include the incorporation of research
              results from the Research Plan into the curriculum and peer-assessment. 
              Completion of the Teaching Plan will introduce a new method of teaching
              engineering concepts that in the long term will produce more creative and
              effective engineers.
