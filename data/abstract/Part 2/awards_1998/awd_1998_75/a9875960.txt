Traditionally, the gap between processor and main
              memory speeds has been bridged by placing a hierarchy of cache memories
              containing successive levels of slower, larger caches between the processor and
              main memory accesses that miss in the faster levels of the hierarchy
              underscoring the need for better cache hierarchy management.

The
              ever-increasing number of on-chip transistors can be employed to track dynamic
              information relevant to memory accesses.  This project investigates novel
              hardware techniques to allow flexible cache management without excessive
              overheads.  The techniques comprise of (1) providing flexible management
              through high cache associativity, (2) providing a shortcut from instructions to
              cache frames to avoid the overhead of high associativity, (3) tracking the
              instructions that compute the address of a cache miss to initiate a prefetch by
              executing such address computations, early, and (4) tracking the instructions
              that access cache blocks to enable replacement of less useful blocks by more
              useful data.  Performance achieved by the proposed hardware-based techniques is
              evaluated by testing widely used benchmarks through a detailed software
              simulator.
