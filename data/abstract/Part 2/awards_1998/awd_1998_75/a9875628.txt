CAREER:
              Appearance-Driven Reconstruction of Three-Dimensinal Scenes in the Physical
              World

This is the first year funding of a four-year continuing award. This
              research investigates the automatic construction of geometric representations
              that accurately capture the three-dimensional shape, appearance, and motion of
              complex scenes in the physical world (objects, indoor/outdoor environments, and
              people). The central idea is that a reconstructed 3D'shape must be consistent
              with a scene's photographs in order to be a valid geometric description of that
              scene. In this paradigm, termed "Appearance-Driven Reconstruction," shape
              recovery is formulated as a geometric constraint satisfaction problem, where
              every input photograph is a constraint that restricts the space of all possible
              3D shapes to only those shapes that reproduce that photograph. When many such
              photographs are available, each taken from a known position in space, they
              define an equivalence class of 3D shape solutions called photo-consistent
              shapes that simultaneously reproduce all input photographs when viewed from the
              photographs' viewpoints. The resulting algorithms aim to (1) compute these
              shapes for a hierarchy of increasingly more complex models for scene
              reflectance, illumination, and the image formation process, (2) provably handle
              scenes of arbitrary geometry and topology, (3) accept arbitrary collections of
              raw, unprocessed photographs as input. Educational activities will center
              around a new laboratory facility for Appearance-Driven Reconstruction where
              undergraduate and graduate students will be immersed into research as soon as
              possible. Course development will include (1) a new project-intensive
              undergraduate'course on "Visual Computing" and (2) a restructuring of the
              graduate computer vision course to emphasize applications in computer graphics
              and image-based rendering.
