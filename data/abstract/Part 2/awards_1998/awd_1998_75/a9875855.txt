Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor J.C. Bradley of Drexel University is supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The
              primary research objective of the proposed work is the development of a novel
              electrodeposition method for the preparation of metal catalysts.  The promise
              of the particular method proposed is that the catalytic activity of the
              material produced can be modulated by control of the electric fields used
              during the deposition process.  Spatial control in the creation of bimetallic
              catalyst systems may also be achieved.   The educational aspect of the proposal
              focuses on the Peak Performance education and training program already in place
              and successful at the PI's institution.  

The project supported by this
              proposal has as its focus the development of methods for contact-less
              deposition of metal and mixed metal layers on insulating supports.  An
              immediate application of the work is the creation of very small wires on
              silicon substrates.  Using the contact-less method minimizes metal atom
              diffusion and allows the structures generated to be very small.  This
              technology may be of use in fabrication of the next generation of integrated
              chips.
