Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Todd L. Lowary of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State
              University.   The research aims both to develop synthetic routes to
              oligosaccharides composed of arabinofuranose residues, and to improve our 
              understanding of the solution conformation of these molecules, using a
              combination of NMR experiments and molecular mechanics computations.   This
              work may lead to novel antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosis.  The
              pathogen which causes the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has
              aribinofuranosides in its cell wall.The educational part of the work will
              include: 1) increasing the carbohydrate content of the introductory organic
              chemistry course and developing a new graduate course, 2) using the internet as
              a teaching resource, including interactive tutorials, and 3) providing a more
              supportive educational environment through the Undergraduate Chemistry Club.  
              Students participating in this research will gain valuable skills in the areas
              of synthesis, structural characterization, and molecular mechanics
              computations.
