Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor David Vanden Bout of the University of Texas at
              Austin is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
              Chemistry Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the
              development of near field optical microscopic techniques to study the rigid rod
              polymer polyfluorene and the small molecule alpha sexithiophene.  Both
              materials have great promise for applications in electronic devices and show
              properties that are dependent on the thin film morphology.  The thin film
              morphology should be evident in the near field images obtained.   The
              educational aspect of the proposal focuses on the development of a state of the
              art integrated laboratory course that introduces microscopy and spectroscopy to
              undergraduates, and works to improve scientific communications skills as
              well.

Near field microscopy is a relatively new optical technique that
              allows the viewing of very small structures on surfaces without optical
              distortion.  In this project, Professor Vanden Bout will use the method to
              examine the shape and orientation of selected molecules held on a rigid
              insulating supporting surface.  The molecules to be studied are those that will
              form the basis for the fabrication of molecular wires.  Molecular wires are
              conductive paths only a few molecules thick and a few molecules wide that are
              the key to successful fabrication of the next generation of microchip
              electronic devices.
