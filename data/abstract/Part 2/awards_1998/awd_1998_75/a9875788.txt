This project aims to develop ways to use chemically
              patterned surfaces as templates for the growth of nanoscale particles. 
              Microcontact printing in a self-asssembled monolayer will be used to anchor the
              growth of multilayer materials.  The particles will be detached from the
              substrate by severing easily cleaved bonds that have been synthesized into the
              anchoring self-assembled monolayer, leaving intact the chemically patterned
              surface for further use - a ditto machine for generating particles.  The goal
              is also to be able to generate novel particle topographies and to make copies
              of particles in solution.  Initially, the materials focus will be on layered
              metal phosphonates consisting of stacked sheets of metal phosphonates
              covalently linked by densely packed organic pillaring groups where a cycle of
              delamination and regrowth could lead to exponential amplification of the
              nanoparticles similar to processes known to occur in biochemical systems.   The
              integration of research themes together with a focus on educational themes that
              emphasize chemistry and public policy for non-science majors will be developed
              and tested as supporting materials to be incorporated into the chemistry
              curriculum.

This research and education involving fundamental
              investigations of materials chemistry is directed at technological applications
              in several environmental areas to illustrate materials chemistry in practice -
              in industry, government, and the courts - to show students how it is used in
              the real  world.
