Abstract    :
              This proposal decsribes an integrated research and educational plan studying the
              design and synthesis of electroactive and conducting polymers to be used for
              chemical separations and sensing technologies. Chemical selectivity will be
              manipulated in the polymers by incorporating targeted fuctional groups in the
              polymeric structure. The electroactive nature of the polymer provides a
              mechanism for external manipulation of the polymer's properties leading to a
              novel class of materials with tunable behavior.  Ion selectivity for example,
              could be controlled by electrochemically switching a conducting polymer from
              its reduced, insulating state to an oxidized conducting form.  The educational
              plan involves the development of new courses focusing on the properties of
              these types of materials and redisigning the undergraduate laboratory course to
              integrate this material into the laboratory  cirriculum.
