Abstract    :
              This project is a CAREER award involving research into the role of halogen
              oxides in tropospheric chemistry and the development of innovative coursework
              in atmospheric and oceanic sciences.  An in-situ instrument employing a
              low-pressure chemical conversion/resonance fluorescence technique will be
              deployed to sites in the boundary layer and free troposphere with the goal of
              detecting BrO and ClO under a variety of environmental and meteorological
              conditions.  These observations will provide insight into the potential for
              halogen chemistry to impact the atmospheric cycling of NOx, HOx, and a variety
              of reactive hydrocarbons.  The new courses to be developed are: 1) an
              inquiry-based laboratory course involving practical experimental work, and 2) a
              seminar-style professional development course involving speakers from industry,
              government, and educational communities.
