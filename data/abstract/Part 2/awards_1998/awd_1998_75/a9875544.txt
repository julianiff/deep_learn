The aim of this research is to develop for the area of solid state
              materials chemistry a rational synthesis of acentric and chiral polymeric
              coordination networks using metal-ligand coordination as the molecular basis
              for the construction.  Three novel aproaches will be examined:  (1) crystal
              engineering of acentric interpenetrated diamonoid networks; (2) design of
              acentric and chiral two-dimensional square grids based on metal
              pyridinecarboxalates; (3) synthesis of acentric, pillared two-dimensional
              sheets of basic trinuclear carboxalates with three-fold rotational symmetry. 
              The educational aims will focus on curriculum development, the encouragement of
              underrespresented groups to become scientists and engineers, the involvment of
              undergraduate and summer high school students in research, and public outreach
              that emphasizes environmental issues.

Crystal engineering of organic
              solids via non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen bonding is emerging as a very
              important area in the design, synthesis, and materials property optimization
              for nonlinear optical device materials, and for the development of novel chiral
              zeolytic materials for separations processes employed in the protection and
              conservation of the environment.
