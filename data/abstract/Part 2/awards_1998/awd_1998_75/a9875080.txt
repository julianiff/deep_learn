Abstract    :
              Jeffrey Krause is supported by a CAREER Grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to study the control of electron dynamics in
              solid-state quantum well structures and gas-phase Rydberg atoms.  He will
              employ full quantum calculations and finite but non-uniform grids.  He will
              also incorporate a computer-based training environment in undergraduate
              chemistry courses and develop a new interdisciplinary curriculum in simulation
              science.

The research component of this grant concerns time-dependent,
              laser-matter interactions.  The application of intense, ultrafast lasers to the
              interrogation and control of matter is of importance to charged carrier
              processes in semiconductors.  This research will design shaped laser pulses to
              control the dynamics and radiative emission in the solid state.  The
              educational component of this grant consists of development of course web
              sites, multimedia presentations, and group activities to make undergraduate
              chemistry lectures more active.
