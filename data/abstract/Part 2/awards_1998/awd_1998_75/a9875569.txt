Abstract    :
              The overall research objective of this award is to advance the state-of-the-art
              in mechanistic theoretical modeling of the response of cells and tissues to
              cryopresevation in order to make possible the rational design of freeze/thaw
              protocols which cause minimal cell damage.  This is to be done by: (1) modeling
              water 
transport in high Peclet number regimes; (2) modeling of the thawing
              process; (3) measuring physical properties of cryoprotectant solutions; (4)
              verifying the models; (5) analyzing tissue cryopreservation; and (6)
              integrating the optimization of freezing and thawing protocols.  The
              educational objectives are to: (1)  enhance awareness of biology among
              engineers and of engineering methods among biologists and clinicians via
              cross-cutting educational activities; and (2) use these interactions to enhance
              educational experiences for students.  The educational objectives are to be
              achieved by using four integrated strategies.
