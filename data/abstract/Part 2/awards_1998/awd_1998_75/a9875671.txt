Abstract    :
              This research focuses on (1) the development of efficient and
              radically
simpler-to-use device CAD for MEMS by employing meshless finite
              cloud
methods (2) the development of mixed continuum (based on
              meshless
computational methods) and atomic scale approaches for accurate
              analysis of
mixed-technology MEMS and (3) the development of efficient
              parallel
algorithms for implementation of the device modeling tools on
              distributed
memory parallel computers.
