Vibration and
              Stability of Spinning Disk-Spindle Systems and High-Speed
Belt Drives

The
              research aspect of this CAREER proposal addresses vibration and stability
              problems in two mechanical systems in wide industrial use: spinning
              disk-spindle systems and high-speed serpentine belt drives.  Disk-spindle
              systems occur in many industrial applications including disk drives, geared
              transmissions, and turbomachinery. Serpentine belt drives are the automotive
              industry standard for powering vehicle accessories.  Similar devices are used
              in paper, tape drive, and textile processing systems. Both systems are subject
              to harmful dynamic response that causes noise, degrades performance, and limits
              operating life. These systems share two important properties: 1) they are
              gyroscopic systems and so their dynamic behaviors share many common features,
              and 2) they combine discrete elements with continuous, elastic bodies. Their
              hybrid discrete-continuous nature requires a novel analytical formulation to
              expose their classical gyroscopic structure and allow application of powerful
              analytical methods for dynamic analysis. A state-of-the-art experimental test
              stand is being designed in cooperation with an industrial sponsor to verify and
              guide the belt research. While the immediate research impact is to advance the
              dynamic modeling and understanding of these two systems, the work
              simultaneously aims to identify how the knowledge gained applies to general
              gyroscopic continua.
The educational initiatives involve: use of computer
              simulations and multimedia display during lectures, classroom demonstrations of
              physical systems,  field trips' to department research labs, and innovative use
              of the Web for lab instruction. The goal is a unique combination of practical
              demonstration of physical phenomena and traditional classroom presentation.
