Abstract    :
              Jarrold is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform
              experiments that systematically probe the interactions between size-selected,
              catalytically relevant metal clusters and simple organic adsorbates using anion
              photoelectron spectroscopy.  The goals are to determine how metal cluster size,
              geometry, and electronic structure determine reactivity in these systems.  In
              the educational part of this CAREER award, local high school science teachers
              will engage in summer research at Jarrold's institution, to develop stronger
              relationships with university-level scientific material and to learn new
              teaching tools.  The continuity of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum will
              be examined as well, in order to devise and test concrete curricular guidelines
              for demographically diverse undergraduate student populations.
              

Understanding chemical catalysis has important ramifications for strategic
              applications such as the petrochemical industry and environmental protection
              processes.  Outcomes from the supported reseach will impact the development of
              heterogeneous catalysis.  The educational projects will contribute to improving
              secondary science education in Chicago-area high schools, and contribute to a
              more coherent and effective undergraduate chemistry curriculum.
