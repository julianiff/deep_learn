The goal of this CAREER project is to study
              techniques and methodologies for execution of constraint logic programs on
              parallel and distributed architectures. These models are  applied to implicit
              and explicit parallelization of complex and irregular symbolic applications,
              such as those arising in Natural Language Processing, Knowledge-based Systems,
              and Digital Libraries. Parallelization is achieved through novel compile-time
              analysis algorithms and efficient run-time process and memory management
              schemes.  The models are also employed to support an  abstract framework for 
              World-Wide-Web programming, based on distributed constraint logic programming
              and embedding specialized constraint domains, meta-programming extensions, and
              Web communication protocols. The framework created serves for rule-based
              coordination of software components. The activities of this project are
              expected to advance the state-of-the-art in these research areas and infuse
              knowledge into NMSU's parallel computing and programming languages educational
              programs. The educational development relies on  curriculum development and on
              the introduction of novel teaching methodologies and collaborations with
              existing educational infrastructures. Emphasis is also placed on improving
              Minority participation in these fields.
