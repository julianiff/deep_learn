Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports reseach and education on aqueous lead chemistry by Dr. Hilary
              A. Godwin of the Chemistry Department, Northwestern University.  The goals of
              the research are to design and synthesize ligands that will bind Pb(II) tightly
              and selectively, correlate the spectroscopic properties of Pb(II) with the
              coordination environment, and develop ratioable fluorescent probes for
              monitoring lead speciation in situ.  A combinatorial approach will be used to
              select ligands, and one- and two-dimensional Pb NMR spectroscopy will be used
              to probe the coordination environment. 

Fluorescent probes will be developed
              which will be helpful in determining lead speciation in biology and in the
              environment.  Students involved in the project will be exposed to an
              interdisciplinary approach.  In addition, emphasis will be placed on
              environmental chemistry in freshman courses and on outreach programs to
              increase awareness of lead poisoning in the Chicago area.
