Abstract    :
              This study focuses on funding causes of individual differences in how the brain
              works.  In many animals, short days during the winter cause individuals to
              become infertile until better conditions in spring.  Two strains of mice have
              been produced that differ strongly in this feature.  One strain becomes
              infertile in short day lengths, and the other does not.  These strains will be
              used to compare brain chemicals and cells in the brain that cause these
              differences in how the brain controls fertility.  Differences will be further
              tested in a wild population of mice.  The goal is to understand a major
              question in animal biology - how do cells and brain chemicals cause individual
              differences in how the brain functions, and specifically how do they control
              fertility and infertility.  More broadly, understanding individual differences
              in the brain will contribute to understanding variation in animal behavior and
              variable responses to medical treatment.  In education, undergraduate students
              need better mentoring program, will provide an undergraduate course on
              research, ethics, and careers in science, will bring research into classroom,
              and will train undergraduates in research methods by intensive involvement in
              actual research.
