Abstract    :

The research focuses on programming-language
              support for the behavioral characterization of observable components in terms
              of logical finite-state machines.  Observable components support two-way
              messaging protocols with their client code, keeping the clients informed of
              significant state changes that affect the component's outward utility.  The
              logical state machines provide a vocabulary for this protocol, serving as
              enforceable characterizations of the component's dynamic protocol.   The
              research objective is to develop practical language mechanisms, rigorous formal
              foundations, and efficient implementation techniques to support observable
              components and to exploit the enforceable state machines to improve the safety
              of component reuse.  A safe implementation would protect components from
              receiving messages out of sequence, and would also protect clients from
              components that are not faithful to their declared state machines.   An
              essential technology in developing and using these components is a notion of
              safe substitutability that would account for the state machine and its implied
              two-way protocols.  The research plan includes formal foundations for safe
              substitutability of components, as well as robust and efficient implementation
              technology in sequential and concurrent contexts.
