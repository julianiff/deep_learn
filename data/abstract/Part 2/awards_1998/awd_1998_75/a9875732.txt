The goal of this project is to evaluate Active Disk
              architectures which integrate significant processing power and memory into a
              disk drive and allow application-specific code to be downloaded and executed on
              the data that is being read from (written to) disk.  This project takes a
              vertical approach spanning architectures, programming model, operating systems
              and algorithms. A stream-based programming model is developed for disklets and
              their interaction with their peers. A restricted execution environment is
              designed for the execution of disklets. A simulator that contains detailed
              models for disks, networks and the associated libraries and device drivers and
              relatively coarse-grain models of processors and I/O interconnects is
              developed. Active Disk algorithms are developed for a suite of data-intensive
              algorithms for relational databases, image processing and satellite data
              processing. The performance of these algorithms running on Active Disks is
              compared with that of efficient algorithms running on conventional
              architectures, such as clusters and SMPs.
