Abstract    :
              Shafer-Ray proposes to measure high-resolution scattering-angle-dependent cross
              sections for atom-diatom reactions such as H + O2 and O(1D) + H2 in order to
              provide a detailed picture of atom-diatom reactive scattering and reveal
              possible dynamical resonances in the H + O2 reaction.  The PI will develop a
              laboratory for an introductory physics course for engineering majors in which
              minilab and group laboratory experiments will be incorporated into block units
              designed to increase students' understanding of physics.

The data gathered
              from these experiments will be benchmarks for comparing theory with experiment.
               Since the gross details of the dynamics of these reactions are well
              established, the detailed data from this work will provide important new
              information for theoreticians to compare with.
