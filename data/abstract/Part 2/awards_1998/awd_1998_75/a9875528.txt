Abstract    :
               This research focuses on storage management systems that support multiple media
              types (video, audio, animations, graphics, images). The framework
              conceptualizes a multimedia presentation as a collection of objects with
              arbitrary temporal constraints. The participant objects and their constraints
              can be defined statically (prior to the display of the presentation) or
              dynamically (during the display). The main goal of this research is to exploit
              these temporal constraints to significantly improve the performance of the
              storage system. This project devises techniques to: (1) place data on disks,
              (2) store redundant information for fault tolerance, and (3) schedule the
              retrieval of data from disks to display statically and dynamically defined
              presentations during normal operation and during disk failures. On the
              educational front, the objective of this project is to: (1) enhance the
              information systems curriculum to incorporate evolving multimedia technology;
              (2) promote collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the field;
              (3) reach students constrained by time, location, and/or physical disability;
              and (4) mentor women pursuing careers in computer science and engineering. An
              undergraduate course on Multimedia Systems and a graduate course on Multimedia
              Database Management Systems are being developed. Also, establishment of
              industrial connections and research seminars are being planned. This research
              has the potential to significantly improve the design of multimedia storage
              systems supporting applications such as: computer animation, virtual reality,
              video games, digital video editing, and authoring tools for education.
