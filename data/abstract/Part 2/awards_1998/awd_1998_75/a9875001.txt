Abstract    :
              The overall goal is the development of novel core-shell functional
              nanostructures having unique microwave and magnetic properties, which are not
              available in the bulk.  Applications are sought in communications, computer
              hardware and magnetic storage systems.  The primary objective is to incorporate
              metal oxide nanoclusters into the self-assembled nanodomains of ABC triblock
              copolymer templates, and to fabricate functional nanostructures exhibiting
              improved magnetic and microwave properties due to the core-shell structure of
              the nanodomains.  One area of research which will be explored is relevant to
              the next generation of magnetic storage.  There is currently considerable
              effort aimed at creating the 100 Gbit per square inch storage systems.  The
              sizes of individual storage elements in such a memory system are in the range
              of 50-100 nm.  This approach will enable us to create core-shell magnetic oxide
              particles, in this size range and confine them into core-shell ABC triblock
              copolymer nanomorphologies.  The core-shell nanomorphology will result in an
              enhancement of the coercivity.  The insertion of metal oxide materials into a
              cheap, manufacturable polymeric matrix would considerably reduce the cost of
              the functional nanostructured device.  The confinement of colossal
              magnetoimpedance metallic oxides in a triblock copolymer core-shell
              nanotemplate can produce a free-standing film, with improved microwave
              absorption properties.

The education activities include undergraduate and
              graduate teaching, development of a new graduate course in Polymer Synthesis,
              and significantly improving the content of an undergraduate course in Materials
              Properties, graduate student advising and various opportunities in
              undergraduate research involvement and mentoring.  K-12 students will also
              benefit from education activities in the proposed program, through an
              interactive web page.
