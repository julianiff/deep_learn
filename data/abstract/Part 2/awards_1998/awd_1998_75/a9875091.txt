Abstract    :
              Kieron Burke  is supported by a CAREER Grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop new methods in excited state density
              functional theory and in time-dependent density functional theory.  His
              applications include molecules in intense laser fields, linear and nonlinear
              optical response, and electronic excited states.  He will also develop a
              workstation-based Science Vision Center and a new multidisciplinary course in
              computational chemistry.

Density functional theory comprises one new method
              in computational chemistry that has proven particularly useful in treating
              large molecular systems such as surfaces.  This work is aimed at improving the
              accuracy, reducing the computational cost, and extending the domain of applied
              density functional theory.   Additionally, outreach programs to local high
              schools are under development, along with the establishment of a new graduate
              program in the Rutgers-Camden chemistry department.   State-of-the-art
              workstations will also be incorporated into the undergraduate science
              curriculum at this urban campus.
