Abstract    :
              9875642  Noguera  This is an award to support research, the objective of which
              is to conduct a rigorous investigation of the microbial ecology of
              aerated-anoxic biological treatment processes for removal of nitrogen from
              wastewater.  Results are expected to provide insights into design of processes
              and their use in treatment systems for more efficient removal of nitrogen from
              wastewaters during their treatment than is possible with conventional
              processing in which aerobic and anaerobic processing are conducted separately. 
              The investigator plans on using molecular methods such as fluorescent in situ
              hybridization and molecular beacons in combination with traditional enrichment
              and isolation techniques in evaluation of microbial coupling of
              ammonia-oxidation with nitrite reduction.  The proposal leading to this award
              was submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
              Program which emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired
              teaching and enthusiastic learning.  The research component of this project is
              expected to provide knowledge that can be applied in engineering design of
              processes and systems to reduce the adverse effects of excessive discharges of
              nitrogen to environmental waters.  The educational component is expected to
              provide undergraduate and graduate students with access to and use of modern
              advanced techniques for study of microbial processes of significance in
              environmental engineering practice and their professional application in
              engineering design of wastewater treatment processes and systems. ***
