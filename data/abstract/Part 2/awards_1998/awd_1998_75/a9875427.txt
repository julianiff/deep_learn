This proposal focuses on novel microstructures formed by
              molecular and mesoscopic self-assembly that possess high degrees of order, well
              defined symmetry, and strong anisotropic optical and dielectric properties. 
              These unique attributes, in conjunction with their versatile fabrication and
              processing, robust thermal and mechanical stability, and responsiveness to
              external fields, will result in interesting physical phenomena and exciting new
              applications.  Various reactive mesogenic compounds are being made available by
              EM Industries and the NSF ALCOM Center at Kent State University to create and
              study microstructures exhibiting novel electrical, optical, and mechanical
              properties of potential high technological interest.  The educational goal of
              this project is to establish a well integrated education and research program
              on soft condensed matter materials at Brown University.  The educational
              program will target K-12 outreach through interactive hands-on modules,
              undergraduate laboratories and curriculum development, and research
              opportunities for undergraduates.

Interest in reactive mesogens is being
              expanded because of their important role in emerging liquid crystal based
              technologies and a richness in physical phenomena that makes these materials
              highly relevant to other applications areas.  For example,  diverse set of
              ordered microstructures on the submicrometer scale that includes solid rods and
              spheres, hollow tubes, 'yarn balls', and torroids are of high technological
              interest and may be extremely useful for optical devices and as a new means of
              controlled drug release.
