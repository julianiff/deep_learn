Abstract    :
              Three recent advances in technology -- the advent of the Web, the revolution of
              digital media, and the dramatic performance improvement of PCs -- have opened
              the door for a host of new 3D computer graphics applications.  Access to this
              technology, as well as broadening interest in graphics among non-technical
              people, drives a growing demand for new ways to catalogue, view, modify, and
              protect 3D models.  Several challenges to providing these tools lie in the
              growing size and heterogeneity of both the data available and the groups of
              people manipulating these data.

This project investigates four application
              areas pertinent to 3D
surfaces: (1) a content-based query method for 3D
              surfaces in order to find 3D models in a large database -- this technique will
              enable people to find 3D models on the Web and will enhance catalogue searching
              for the digital library of the future; (2) algorithms for surface interpolation
              in order to visualize either the time-evolution of an isosurface or an
              animation of the isosurface from low to high threshold values -- this
              technology will aid understanding of 3D data sets such as those resulting from
              medical scans or astrophysical simulations; (3) controls for reshaping a 3D
              model based on hand-drawn gestures and interactions with other models -- these
              controls permit 3D animators to reshape models in a natural way, and they allow
              2D
animators to apply complex textures to hand-drawn figures; and (4) a method
              for insertion and detection of an invisible digital watermark in a 3D surface
              -- watermarking technology addresses concerns about copyright protection of
              proprietary models, and will thereby spur the proliferation of new models on
              the Web.

A factor that binds these projects together is that they rely on
              two common underlying technologies.  The projects share a common
fundamental
              technology -- multiresolution analysis -- a tool for
representing and
              manipulating data at different levels of detail.  At a higher level, they share
              a common problem -- the surface correspondence problem -- which looks at how to
              map one surface onto another optimally.  Solutions to this problem have direct
              application in the four projects highlighted above.
