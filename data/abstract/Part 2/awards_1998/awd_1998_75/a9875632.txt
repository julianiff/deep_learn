Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Messmer of Lehigh University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The
              primary research objective of the proposed work is the development of infrared
              sum frequency generation to study adsorption and response to mechanical
              perturbation of thin films self-assembled on silica and graphite. 
              Understanding of the processes involved may lead to improved lubricants,
              adhesives, and protective coatings.  C-H bonding and rocking modes in assembled
              mololayer alkyl chains will be one of the first targets of study.  Simultaneous
              spectral and force measurements are proposed to unlock changes associated with
              the frictional effect.  The educational aspect of the proposal focuses on
              CHEMPals, a mentoring program especially designed to encourage science interest
              in 11-13 year old girls.

The spectroscopic measurements described here are
              part of a fundamental study to determine the orientation of molecules on
              surfaces.  The shape of the molecule and its connection to the surface are
              controlling forces that determine  surface properties such as friction, and
              understanding of these forces is part of a study to produce molecules that are
              better lubricants.
