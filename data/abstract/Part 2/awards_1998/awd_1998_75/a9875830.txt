The educational portion of this project concentrates on
              updating and revitalizing a set of natural science courses specifically
              designed for elementary education majors.  These courses have broader content
              than normal introductory science courses, are intensively "hand-on", and are
              limited to 40 students per section.  The PI will update an existing course, and
              develop two new courses relating to environmental Earth Science.  The research
              portion of the project is centered on adsorption, dissolution-growth, and
              electron transfer processes are closely linked, and a better fundamental
              understanding of them is needed in order to more fully understand the many
              roles of Fe as a globally (and environmentally) important electron transfer
              mediator.
