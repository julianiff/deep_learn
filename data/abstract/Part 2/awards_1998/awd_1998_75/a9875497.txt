Abstract    :
              Professor Shi's research interests are methodological, and he proposes a study
              of the Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation reaction in order to expand its scope and
              to develop ways to prepare optically active products.  Incorporation of a
              modifier is expected to result in asymmetric induction as well as increases in
              reaction rates and selectivities.  These modifiers are of two types:  protic or
              Lewis acids including chiral alcohols, and chiral ligands that coordinate zinc,
              or some combination of the two.  Professor Shi has been very active in bringing
              his expertise in organic synthesis and asymmetric catalysis to the fore in the
              development of new curricular offerings for graduate students.  A new course
              being planned is bioorganic chemistry, which will emphasize the connections
              between cellular structure and function, and the chemistry that governs these
              features and their interactions with drug molecules.

With this CAREER award,
              the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and teaching efforts of Dr.
              Yian Shi of Colorado State University.  Professor Shi endeavors to find ways to
              make the smallest carbon structures that are cyclic in nature, cyclopropanes. 
              The methods that Professor Shi will develop promise to offer new ways to make
              these compounds while offering precise control over their three-dimensional
              structure.  In the classroom, Professor Shi offers his expertise to graduate
              students in the form of cutting-edge courses in organic synthesis, asymmetric
              catalysis, and bioorganic chemistry.  Through the NSF-REU site at Colorado
              State, Professor Shi is also committed to the expansion of undergraduate
              research students' exposure to the methods and opportunities of the scientific
              method.
