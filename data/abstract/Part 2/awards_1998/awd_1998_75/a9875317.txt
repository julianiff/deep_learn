Abstract    :
              The proposed research is to study nonlinear interaction of light and matter in
              thin polymer films and in molecular systems.  The molecules may be doped or
              attached to the polymer matrices.  It is proposed to combine optical near field
              scanning tip microscopy with femtosecond optical pulses to investigate the
              multiphoton interactions.  The ultimate goal is to investigate interactions of
              light with single molecules  and study its nonlinear effect in their local
              environment.  Femtosecond optical pulses can be used to time-resolve these
              effects.  The educational component of this proposal is to establish an MS
              degree program in Applied Physcis/Optoelectronics in WSU.
