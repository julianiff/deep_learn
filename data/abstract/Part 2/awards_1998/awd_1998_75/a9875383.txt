This award funds programs for research and education with
              special emphasis in algebraic geometry and nonabelian Hodge theory.  The
              investigator plans to study the actions of homotopy groups and homology groups
              on homotopy types of varieties using developments in nonabelian Hodge theory as
              introduced by C. Simpson.  The investigator hopes to shed light on the
              interplay between the geometric structure of algebraic varieties and the
              representation theory of their fundamental groups.   In addition to his
              research, the investigator proposes a number of broadly based activities for
              the promotion of education at all levels.  This includes the mentoring of high
              school students through the Mathematical Circles initiative, which brings these
              students to campus for tutoring and help in competitive exams.  Moreover, the
              investigator intends to enhance opportunities for graduate students and
              postdoctural fellows at Irvine by organization of research workshops in
              algebraic geometry.

The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the
              early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The
              Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program
              that provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their
              overall career development.  It combines in a single program the support of
              quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation
              of those traditionally underrepresented in sciences and engineering.  This
              program enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the
              development of full, balanced academic careers.
