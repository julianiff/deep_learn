     The investigator designs and analyzes effective
              numerical
techniques for solving certain classes of nonlinear elliptic
              and
parabolic partial differential equations on complicated domains,
arising
              in mathematical biology and gravitation.  The work
focuses on adaptive
              multilevel finite element methods, a powerful
class of numerical approximation
              techniques for dealing with
irregular domain geometries, degenerate
              coefficients, and
complicated nonlinearities, in an optimal or nearly optimal
              way.
Specific target applications for this work are the
              nonlinear
Poisson-Boltzmann equation arising in continuum models
              of
biomolecules, the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the
Einstein
              equations, and some related elliptic and parabolic
equations that arise in the
              topological classification of
surfaces in geometry.  While this work has a
              large theoretical
component, to have an impact in biology and physics requires
              a
substantial amount of software development, as well as
interdisciplinary
              collaboration with scientists in the relevant
areas.  The required
              implementations are developed by the
investigator and his students as class
              library extensions to his
software package MC (Manifold Code), and the
              resulting software
is made available to researchers in the biology and
              physics
communities.  This project is an NSF CAREER grant.
     The
              computational methods developed in this project have a
direct impact on the
              modeling capabilities of rational drug
design researchers using
              structure-based models of biomolecules.
The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is a
              well-established model for
electrostatic interactions of biomolecules,
              allowing one to
predict the effectiveness of a candidate drug molecule
              in
negotiating the onion-like layers of the electrostatic field on
its
              journey to bind to the active site in a target biomolecule.
For example,
              through the use of these types of structure-based
numerical models, one can
              predict the effectiveness of a
candidate HIV proteinase inhibitor in binding
              to the active site
in the HIV proteinase.  However, the Poisson-Boltzmann
              equation
presents severe technical difficulties for solution by
              numerical
methods on computers.  By developing improved multilevel
numerical
              techniques to reduce the computer time required to
solve the Poisson-Boltzmann
              equation, and at the same time
producing more accurate solutions through the
              use of adaptive
finite element methods, the investigator gives drug
              designers
access to models that produce more accurate results in less
              time.
In addition, a critical ingredient for the success of this and
related
              projects is the education and training of the next
generation of computational
              mathematicians.  Therefore, a fully
integrated involvement in undergraduate
              and graduate
computational mathematics education is an integral part of
              the
project.  In particular, the investigator develops two
              new
project-oriented, interdisciplinary, computational mathematics
courses at
              UC San Diego, modeled after a successful experimental
course he taught at UC
              Irvine in 1997-1998.  This project is a
National Science Foundation CAREER
              grant.  NSF strongly
encourages the early development of academic faculty as
              both
educators and researchers.  The Faculty Early Career
              Development
(CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides
              for
the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall
career
              development.  It combines in a single program the support
of quality research
              and education in the broadest sense and the
full participation of those
              traditionally underrepresented in
sciences and engineering.  This program
              enhances and emphasizes
the importance the Foundation places on the
              development of full,
balanced academic careers.
