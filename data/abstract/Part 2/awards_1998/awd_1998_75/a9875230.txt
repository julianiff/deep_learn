Abstract    :
              Deborah Evans is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to extend current quantum dynamics
              methodological and massively parallel computing techniques to enable realistic
              simulations on electron transport through polymer films.  The numerical studies
              focus on the underlying mechanism of electron transport relevant on the
              microscopic scale for the design of nanoscale devices.  Evans teaching plan is
              to establish a summer minority outreach program in high performance computing
              and chemical physics for a small number of undergraduate students.  She will
              develop curricula in chemical physics and high performance computing to enhance
              the numerical capabilities of chemistry students in applying computational
              techniques to solve fundamental physics problems.

Technological advances
              have made the manufacture of electronic devices on the nano- and molecular
              scale possible.  This has led to an increased activity in experimental studies
              of simple models for these devices, including electron transfer studies on thin
              films and polymeric materials.  Transport properties in complex materials is
              challenging because electron behavior should be treated quantum mechanically,
              but an exact solution of the problem including the environment cannot be
              achieved quantum mechanically.  Evans is employing massively parallel computing
              techniques which treat environmental effects at the classical and semiclassical
              level to enable realistic systems of reasonable size to be studied.
