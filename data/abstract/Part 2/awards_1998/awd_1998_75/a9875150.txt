Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports research and education on metal-based catalysts on silicon
              surfaces by Dr. Jillian M. Buriak of the Chemistry Department, Purdue
              University.  The goal of the research is to establish a new way of modulating
              the electronic properties of catalysts to increase their selectivity.  Metal
              complexes will be bound to semiconducting porous silicon surfaces through a
              conjugated linking ligand.  A potential applied to the silicon will then be
              varied to effectively adjust the electronic properties of the reactive metal
              site.  Many powerful surface techniques will be used to characterize the
              attached complexes: FTIR, DRIFTS, ATR-IR, TOF-SIMS, XPS, and solid state NMR. 
              

Compounds acting as catalysts will be attached to a silicon surface and the
              electronic properties will be modulated to improve their selectivity, thereby
              improving reactions and minimizing undesirable by-products. Undergraduate
              students will participate in the research, and special efforts will be made to
              improve undergraduate inorganic courses by incorporating computers and
              molecular modeling into the classroom experience.
