Abstract    :
              As the genomes of bacteria are explored in greater detail, it has
              become
obvious that most genes are present at a single position on
              the
chromosome.  The most obvious exceptions to this observation are the
              genes
that encode for ribosomal RNAs, for which there are as many as 15
              copies.
This work will represent the first comprehensive effort to explain
              the
puzzling occurrence of multiple ribosomal RNA genes in
              bacteria.
Preliminary results suggest that the number of rRNA genes reflects
              the
ecological strategies of diverse bacteria: those possessing
              multiple
copies may exhibit increasing competitive fitness when nutrient
              availability
fluctuates, while those possessing few copies may be more
              efficient at
growth under constant, low-nutrient conditions.  The PIs will
              examine the
possibility that the number of ribosomal RNA genes in a bacterial
              genome
represents one trait among a group of interdependent traits that
              influence
the distribution of bacterial populations in nature.  The
              principles
derived from this research should be applicable to understanding
              the
distribution of bacteria that play crucial roles in the global cycling
              of
elements as well as bacteria used in bioremediation or those that
              have
symbiotic relationships with plants or animals.
