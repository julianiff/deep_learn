The focus of the proposed research
              program is on the development of sensing technology and model-inversion based
              identification methods to infer online the molecular weight distribution (MWD)
              of polymer melts based on broad-band dielectric measurements.  The ultimate
              goal of the research is to develop new polymer processing technology for online
              customization of the properties of the final product by varying the processing
              conditions during extrusion and molding.  The inverted fringe-effect
              microdielectric sensing with controlled depth of field penetration is a novel
              approach for measuring spatially resolved properties of a material in a
              direction normal to the interface.  In the proposed approach, methods for
              inferring MWD online from dielectric measurements will be based on theoretical
              modeling of polymer relaxation in electromagnetic fields and on statistical
              correlation methods.  Theoretical and experimental studies will be followed by
              the development of advanced process control systems, which will enable online
              polymer customization by varying conditions during processing.  The educational
              program is aimed at creating a balanced undergraduate process control
              curriculum, which includes project-based hands-on experience in implementing
              practical control systems in laboratory settings.
