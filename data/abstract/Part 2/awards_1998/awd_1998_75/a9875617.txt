Title: CAREER: Synchronization, Monitoring,
              and Communication for Distributed 
       Agents


Complex distributed
              applications can use event abstraction to provide 
simplicity to the
              programmer and system designer by reducing the amount of 
information to be
              handled. However, it is necessary to retain a fine degree of 
control over the
              synchronization conditions in the computation. This research
investigates a
              framework to provide the necessary control on synchronization 
and
              communication among the distributed agents by addressing the following.
              
First, various forms of synchronization between distributed agents whose
              
actions can be viewed at different levels of abstraction are defined.
              
Second, mechanisms to specify and enforce the desired forms of
              synchronization,
to detect the forms of synchronization that occur, and to
              monitor the 
computation nonintrusively are designed. Third, algorithms for
              efficient 
communication among the synchronizing agents are designed and
              evaluated. 
The research is expected to impact the ease with which the
              increasingly 
complex distributed applications can be synchronized,
              controlled, and 
monitored while maintaining a fine degree of control over the
              synchronization 
involved. This has the potential to simplify the design of
              the rapidly
increasing number of large distributed applications.
