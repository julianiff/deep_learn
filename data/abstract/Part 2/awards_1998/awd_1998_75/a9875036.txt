Abstract    :
              Professor Catrakis and his research group will bring distinctive experimental
              and analytical strengths to the study of turbulent mixing and mixed-fluid
              interface behaviors.  These physical phenomena play important roles in chemical
              reactions and diffusive transports of thermal energy and contaminants species. 
              The experimental work will employ high resolution digital imaging.  The
              analytical work incorporates novel elements of fractal-geometry considerations.
               His educational efforts will include the preparation of a textbook in this
              important area of engineering science.
