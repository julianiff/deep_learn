Abstract    :
              9875580  Harrington  The objective of this project is to investigate the
              influence of water treatment processes that reduce concentrations of
              disinfectant demanding substances such as natural organic matter on the
              effectiveness of disinfectants such as ozone and chlorine for inactivation of
              cryptosporidium species of pathogenic significance in water.  The investigator
              plans on using completely mixed flow-through reactors to evaluate inactivation
              of cryptosporidium oocysts as a step toward development of mathematical models
              of the inactivation processes that can be used in engineering design of water
              treatment processes.  The research will be conducted in cooperation with the
              Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, which will provide the cryptosporidium
              species used and will perform determinations of viability.  The combined vital
              dye/flow cytometry approach to be used will permit a larger matrix of
              experiments than would be possible with other alternatives such as
              observartions of animal infectivity.  The proposal leading to this award was
              submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
              which emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired teaching
              and enthusiastic learning.  the research component of this project is expected
              to provide knowledge that can be applied in engineering design of processes and
              systems to inactivate cryptosporidium species from water supplies.  The
              educational component is expected to provide undergraduate and graduate
              students with access to techniques for study of microbial inactivation
              processes for water treatment of significance in environmental engineering
              practice.  The investigator's private-sector experience in consulting practice
              is expected to provide students with practical experiences in relating results
              of research to utility in engineering practice, in fostering creative thinking
              and emphasizing communication skills.  ***
