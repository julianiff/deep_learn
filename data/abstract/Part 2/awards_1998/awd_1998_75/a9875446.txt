Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program supports research and education on immobilized olefin polymerization
              catalysts by Dr. Paul A. Deck of the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute.  Group 4 metallocene complexes, already known to have catalytic
              activity in solution, will be supported on silica in such a way that the
              catalytic sites will be isolated from the support surface and therefore retain
              their effectiveness.  Multiple short tethers will hold ancillary ligands to the
              surface.  The interface established will be characterized by surface analytical
              methods, and detailed reactivity studies and computational modeling will be
              carried out.   Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in a new
              course on scientific professionalism that will provide orientation to
              non-technical issues and situations encountered in professional life.  Career
              development strategies, ethics, and business concepts will be introduced.
