The focus of the research plan is the quantification of
              fundamental processes controlling combustion and pollutant formation in a
              direct-injection gasoline engine.  The effect of the cylinder flowfield on the
              mixing rate of the spray is assessed by comparing cases with known flow
              characteristics (controlled by a shrouded intake valve) with results from a
              totally quiescent case.  The latter is achieved by deactivating the intake and
              exhaust valves and undergoing several compression/expansion strokes before
              injecting the fuel; this allows the fluid motion to dissipate while retaining
              the time variations of temperature and pressure and the moving boundaries of
              the baseline engine configuration.  Mixing is evaluated by tracking the
              evolution of the fuel vapor distribution as measured by planar laser-induced
              fluorescence (PLIF).  To ascertain whether lean quenching of the flame is a
              significant source of hydrocarbon emissions, simultaneous PLIF measurement of
              the present fuel and of hydroxyl radial are performed.
 
The educational
              program concentrates on the restructuring an existing instrumentation
              laboratory course to use a problem-based approach.  In the first part of the
              course the students are given general information about instrumentation and
              data acquisition systems; for the majority of the semester, they are given a
              series of increasingly difficult problems which they must diagnose
              experimentally.  The program includes training of instructional personnel and
              assessment of the efficacy of the problem-based approach to a laboratory
              course.
