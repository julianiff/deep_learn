Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Hicham Fenniri of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue
              University.   The research aims to: 1) synthesize large supramolecular
              assemblies with predefined architecture, using molecules held in hexameric
              rosettes by multiple hydrogen bonds between neighboring complementary units, 2)
              investigate the factors which lead to assembly formation and stability, and 3)
              develop artificial sensors using a combination of combinatorial chemistry and
              self-assembly.   The molecules synthesized in this project might find uses in
              drugs, biosensors, and separations.
The educational part of this proposal
              includes developing a new advanced course on combinatorial chemistry, and
              improving current laboratory courses for first and second year undergraduate
              students in a variety of ways, including: 1) improved laboratory hand-outs, 2)
              a new template to report experimental results, 3) better training of teaching
              assistants, and 4) on-line chemical searching in the laboratory.   Students
              doing research with the PI will learn valuable skills in the areas of organic
              synthesis of supramolecular materials and combinatorial chemistry.
