The scientific component of this CAREER award is a project
              that will use state-of-the-art laser cooling and trapping techniques to produce
              cold and trapped Rydberg atoms.  Different methods of Rydberg atom trapping
              will be demonstrated and characterized.  Once formed, cold and trapped Rydberg
              atoms will be used to study high-density Rydberg systems and to perform
              high-precision spectroscopy and atom interferometry with Rydberg atoms.  The
              research component will be accompanied by a summer outreach program directed
              toward high school students.
