Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to evaluate the chemical and biochemical
              processes that result in the binding of select contaminants to soils and
              sediments.  Such binding reactions can affect the fate and transport of
              pollutants by their in-situ humification with a significant impact on the
              chemicals' environmental mobility and ecotoxicity.  Research will focus on
              studying the environmental fate of phenols and anilines in soils and sediments.
               Oxides of transition metals and enzymes can catalyze oxidative coupling
              reactions that polymerize select chemicals or bind them covalently to
              humic-acid type macromolecules.  The proposed research will investigate the
              possibility of engineering similar humification processes in natural soils and
              sediments to permanently "trap" and detoxify phenols, anilines and hydroxylated
              polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.  Ecotoxicology of the sequestered
              contaminants will be assessed by evaluating their leachability, bioavailablilty
              and toxicity.  The overall results of this investigation will comprise the
              basis for a scientific understanding of the factors controlling enzyme and
              metal oxide mediated sequestration of aromatic acids and bases in soils and
              sediments, and provide information on the applicability of engineered
              humification processes to achieve health-risk based alternative remediation
              endpoints.
