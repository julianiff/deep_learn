In this research supported by a CAREER Award the PI will
              study the dynamics of electronic excitations in one-dimensional materials, such
              as platinum ethylenediamine complexes.  Specific issues addressed are the
              dynamics of the formation of photoinduced defect states, the time evolution of
              the electronic excitations, and the transport properties of the excitations.
              Femtosecond optical techniques, including ultrafast transient absorption,
              impulsive vibrational excitation, and photon echo measurements will be
              employed. Strong emphasis is given to the improvement of the undergraduate
              curriculum in optical physics by developing state of the art laboratory
              activities.  The PI will also develop and implement plans for improving the
              retention and professional success of women students in science and
              engineering.

In this project supported by a CAREER award the PI will
              study the interactions between electrons and the lattice of solid metal-organic
              compounds by using several ultra-fast optical techniques.  The research will
              engage graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them for careers in
              areas of advanced science and technology for the 21st Century.  Strong emphasis
              will be given to the improvement of  the undergraduate curriculum in optical
              physics, an area which is now, and for many years to come of great importance
              to basic science and technology.  Plans will be developed and implemented for
              improving the retention and professional success of women students in science
              and engineering.
