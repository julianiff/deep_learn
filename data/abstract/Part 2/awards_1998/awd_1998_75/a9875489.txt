Abstract    :
              The research proposed aims to prepare macromolecular dendrimer systems
              containing electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups and capable of mimicing
              photosynthesis, and to study their photochemistry and photophysics.   By
              varying the electrochemical properties of the D and A groups and the distances
              between them, the PI intends to learn how to get effective intramolecular
              electron transfer after absorption of light, followed by the intermolecular
              electron transfer needed to convert light energy into electrical potential. 
              

With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. David A. Modarelli of the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of Akron.    His study of photosynthesis mimics could provide an
              effective nonbiological way to convert solar energy into chemical energy (e.g.
              in the form of H2 and O2), which can then be used to generate electricity, or
              power vehicles, without contributing to global warming through the greenhouse
              effect.The educational part of his work includes: 1) integrating computer
              modeling into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, 2) exposing senior
              undergraduates to physical organic chemistry and reaction dynamics, and 3)
              including high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students in his
              research team.   Students will gain valuable experience in synthesis, chemical
              dynamics, and computational chemistry.
