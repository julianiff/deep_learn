CAREER: Object-Level 3D Reconstruction Techniques for Mobile
              Robots


This is the first year funding of a four-year continuing award. The
              research component of this CAREER program will focus on the problem of
              constructing an object level, 3D model of a scene using the image data obtained
              from one or more video cameras mounted on a mobile robot platform. The ability
              to construct and maintain accurate, object level models of the environment
              registered to the image data is a fundamental capability that  could be
              exploited in a variety of ways in a mobile robot application. Toward this end, 
              research will be carried out on three related problems: (1) extending the
              reconstruction 
techniques to make use of the imagery acquired with an
              omnidirectional camera system (2) developing effective model tracking
              algorithms that can be used to update the model of  the scene as the robot
              moves (3) developing algorithms that can automatically determine how a given
              scene could be modeled in terms of parameterized primitives.
The education
              component of this award includes new course curriculum development,
              undergraduate and graduate research projects, mentoring of  minority students
              and outreach in the K-12 system. Outreach efforts to minority high-school
              students will include the development of new course curriculum modules which
              take advantage of students' natural curiosity about robotic systems to
              reinforce learning of fundamental techniques in mathematics, physics and
              computer science.
