Abstract    :
              9875598

Flow cytometry is a technology for analyzing and sorting cells that
              requires the analysis of a large number of high-dimensional data.  In
              collaboration with one of the pioneering flow cytometry groups the proposal
              writer will develop the statistical methods necessary to transform this
              technique from a manually operated apparatus to an internet-accessible digital
              library.  The research will exploit some surprising properties of log-concave
              densities to solve various statistical and computational problems in mixture
              analysis and visualization.  The investigator will also organize summer
              conferences for junior faculty members to learn the tools necessary to
              effectively teach freshman seminars, which are gaining a firm foothold in many
              universities.

Flow cytometry has become a widely used tool to analyze cells.
               Until the mid 1980's, the technique was used almost exclusively in the
              research community.  Recently, it has become a prevalent instrument in the
              clinical setting: it is the primary method for staging HIV disease, and it is
              commonly used to detect leukemia and lymphomas. Virtually every modern hospital
              now has flow cytometer.  The analysis of the resulting data poses considerable
              statistical challenges, which so far have prevented an effective digital use of
              the results. The investigator will address these issues with novel statistical
              techniques. Further, the grant will support summer conferences organized by the
              investigator to disseminate the tools necessary to effectively teach freshman
              seminars. These seminars are designed to involve undergraduates in interactive
              learning and research at an early stage, and are getting increasingly popular
              at many universities.
