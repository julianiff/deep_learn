Abstract    :
              

A Computer Test-Bed for First-Principle Simulation of Blast-Resistant
              Structures

Combating terrorism and assuring the security of the United
              States is a national priority. The main objective of this project is to develop
              a computer test-bed for first-principle simulation of blast-resistant
              structures, and to improve the education in this area. To predict multi-scale
              structural failure under blast loads, it is planned that the transition among
              three basic types of governing differential equations be investigated based on
              the physics involved, and a moving discretization method in the domain of
              influence be developed to discretize different scales. A coordinated
              educational program, integrated with the research program, is to be performed
              to promote undergraduate, graduate and continuing education in blast-resistant
              design, to encourage minority students to get involved into advanced topics in
              science and engineering, and to improve the public awareness of terrorism and
              threat prevention. This research and educational program is an important part
              of the newly established National Center for Explosion Resistant Design that
              represents a strong partnership among government, industry and academia.
