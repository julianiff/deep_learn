Abstract    :
              

The overall goal of this project is to initiate a strong academic career
              integrating educational and research activities in the area of mechanics of
              materials.  The objective of the research program is to develop a comprehensive
              understanding of the plastic response of reinforced metals (especially
              particulate-reinforced and fiber-reinforced aluminum) subjected to multiaxial
              loading.  A study of reinforced aluminum will be performed to provide a
              multiaxial description of overall plasticity associated with constrained
              plastic flow in the metallic matrix.  Contours of constant plastic flow will be
              experimentally determined for internal pressure-axial-torsional loading of
              reinforced tubular specimens, then utilized, with the help of micromechanics,
              to develop a macroscale continuum model.  The primary educational goal is to
              present mechanics issues to students in a more participatory environment, that
              is, one in which the students experience mechanics rather than passively learn
              about it.  The primary educational activity is the development of an
              undergraduate course that emphasizes the integration of mechanics theory,
              numerical computations, and experiments through study of real manufactured
              products and structural elements.
