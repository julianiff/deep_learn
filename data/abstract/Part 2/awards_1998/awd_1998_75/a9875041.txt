Abstract    :
              

Alberti - 9875041.  Urbanization is a pervasive, widely distributed process
              that is occurring widely throughout the world.  Urban development has wide
              ranging impacts on the occurrence of natural habitats, energy flow and nutrient
              cycling.  Understanding these effects of ecosystem characteristics is critical
              for human well being and the persistence of natural and human-effected
              ecosystems.  This project involves an empirical investigation of the effects of
              urban development patterns on ecological conditions in the Greater Seattle
              Area.  It focuses on population and community dynamics of native and introduced
              organisms.  It will examine urban development and its impact on an urban to
              rural gradient in Greater Seattle.  The central hypothesis is that ecological
              conditions in an urban-to-rural gradient are influenced by urban form, land-use
              intensity, land-use heterogeneity, and cover connectivity.  It will be tested
              for bird, plant, and aquatic-macroinvertebrate communities.
