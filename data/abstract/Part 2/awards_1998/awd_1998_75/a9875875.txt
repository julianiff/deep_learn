Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Dr. Sandra Rosenthal at Vanderbilt University is supported
              by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The focus of the
              research is femtosecond fluorescence studies of charge transfer reactions in
              nanocrystal-based photovoltaic systems with the goal of exploiting quantum
              confinement in semiconducting nanocrystals to create high speed and efficiency
              photovoltaics. Specific ojectives are to determine and control the fate of
              photocreated electron-hole pairs in semiconducting nanocrystals, to determine
              the rate and mechanism of nanocrystal to C60 electron transfer, to determine
              the rate and mechanism of nanocrystal to polymer hole transfer, and to
              determine the ideal nanocrystal size for nanocrystal/C60/polymer-based
              photovoltaics. Fundamental issues to be addressed will be characterization of
              semiconductor nanocrystal surfaces at the atomic level and the role surface
              density of states plays in carrier relaxation and charge-transfer, ultrafast
              spectroscopy of charge-transfer  in systems where a quantum confined
              semiconductor serves as a donor, and electron transfer in electroactive
              polymers. This research could impact and lead to commercially viable
              photovoltaic and  optoelectronic devices.

Apart from involving
              undergraduates in the above research, the teaching component of the CAREER
              award will facilitate involvement of undergraduates in the Chemistry Department
              broadly through the establishment of integrated Analytical-Physical Chemistry
              labs and courses emphasizing use of advanced spectroscopic and surface
              microscopy instrumentation .
