The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early
              development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that
              provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall
              career development.  It combines in a single program the support of quality
              research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation of
              those traditionally underrepresented in sciences and engineering.  This program
              enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development
              of full, balanced academic careers.
