Abstract    :
              
Professor William Green will develop algorithmic and molecular modeling
              methodology to predict the kinetics of complex reaction systems such as
              combustion of fuels and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and small amines and
              nitriles. Transition state theory and scattering theory will allow a priori
              calculation of individual rate constants. Selected constants will be
              experimentally validated primarily by overall reaction rate measurement and
              laser flash photolysis of reactive intermediates. Thus a combination of group
              additivity, quantum calculations and limited experimental data will be used to
              estimate unknown rate constants, including their uncertainty. A simulation
              algorithm --already implemented--  will allow the construction of complex
              reaction schemes by identifying the kinetically significant species.  The focus
              will be on the free-radical chemistry of small organic molecules in the gas
              phase and in weakly interacting solvents. Such is most important in oxidation
              and pyrolysis, but is also relevant to materials synthesis (e.g.,
              plasma-enhanced CVD) and photo-remediation of pollutants. The educational
              portion of the grant will entail the development of a new graduate course in
              predictive chemical kinetics emphasizing molecular simulation, as well as
              modules for the existing undergraduate courses at MIT. Dissemination will be
              done via a web-site. The impact of this grant is expected to occur in the
              chemical, fuel, and environmental protection industries, as well as in
              engineering education.
