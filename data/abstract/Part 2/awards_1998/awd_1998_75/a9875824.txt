Abstract    :
              Mark Tuckerman is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to study hydrogen bonding and proton transfer
              in strong acid/base hydrates and gas hydrate crystals using ab initio molecular
              dynamics and path integral molecular dynamics.  He will also use density
              functional theoretical methods to study the surface chemistry involved in
              dehydration and Diels-Alders reactions of hydrocarbons on semiconductor
              surfaces.  Tuckerman's teaching plan involves an integration of his research
              and interdisciplinary background into the curricula of graduate statistical
              mechanics and undergraduate freshman chemistry courses.  Graphic visualization
              of computer simulations will be used at the undergraduate level.  Graduate
              students will be taught simulations and apply the techniques to realistic
              problems.

Although most technologically important chemical processes occur
              in condensed phases, often with the use of a heterogeneous catalyst, little is
              known about the detailed molecular nature of these processes.  Only recently
              have modern theoretical methods been applied to the microscopic details of
              chemical reactions in condensed phases.  Tuckerman's research program is
              designed to use modern ab initio computational approaches, employing massively
              parallel computers, to study such processes thus deepening our theoretical
              understanding of the molecular details of such systems.
