Abstract    :
              The overall research objective of this award is to apply 
engineering
              principles through mathematical modeling to elucidate 
important parameters
              and variables key to the regulation of growth 
factor transport.  This type of
              analysis should find practical use 
in deciphering how therapeutics might find
              access to underlying 
tissue or be cleared from the blood stream in a timely
              fashion.  
The educational objective revolves around the idea that learning
              
relies on effective communication and that team building skills 
are
              critical for interdisciplinary work.  Methods proposed to meet 
the
              educational objective include: (1)  the assembly of a 
biochemical track for
              undergraduate students interested in 
cellular engineering; (2) the
              development of an upper-level 
undergraduate/graduate course in cellular
              engineering; (3) the 
provision of opportunities for women and minorities to
              investigate 
what graduate school and cellular engineering involve through
              
undergraduate research;  and (4) the incorporation of active 
learning as
              well as writing analysis in both classroom instruction 
and research group
              meetings to promote deep learning.
