Abstract    :
              9875171  George Necula 
A major challenge in building software systems is to
              ensure that the various components fit together in a well-defined manner.  This
              problem is exacerbated by the recent advent of software components whose origin
              is unknown or inherently untrusted, such as mobile code or user extensions for
              operating system kernels or database servers.  Such system integrity and
              security problems are tackled using techniques from mathematical logic and
              programming language semantics, in the framework provided by Proof-Carrying
              Code.  As part of this research, the existing Proof-Carrying Code framework is
              extended to deal both with new language features such as objects, higher-order
              functions and copying garbage collection, and with more complex safety and
              liveness properties, such as information flow and resource usage constraints. 
              This requires the investigation of new formal reasoning systems that are
              capable of encoding the enriched safety  properties along with new proof
              methods to assist the generation of the safety proofs.
