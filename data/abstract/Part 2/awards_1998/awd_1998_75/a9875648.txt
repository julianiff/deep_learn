Abstract    :
              9875648  David B. Stewart
Education and research projects focus on software
              engineering for embedded real-time systems.  Educational activities emphasize
              practical hands-on, inter-disciplinary learning by designing and implementing
              low-cost embedded systems in university laboratories.  The objective of the
              research is to automate the analysis and fine-tuning of an embedded system's
              temporal properties to facilitate debugging of timing errors.  Automation is
              achieved by designing a prediction mechanism that uses a combination of
              measured data, desired requirements, and theoretical models to predict what
              fine-tuning operations can aid in correcting the errors.  A computer-aided
              software engineering (CASE) tool incorporates the methods, to make the research
              available to embedded system programmers.  The impact of the integrated
              research and education plan is that more engineers will be available to fill
              the demand for embedded real-time software developers. Through education, more
              students will have hands-on experience with embedded systems, thus better
              preparing them for work in industry. Through research, better tools will enable
              engineers with expertise in other areas to implement their applications, even
              without an in-depth background in real-time systems theory. Together,
              development time for embedded systems can decrease and quality can be improved,
              ultimately leading to a lower cost for embedded system products.
