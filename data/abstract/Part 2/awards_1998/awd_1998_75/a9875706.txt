Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Early Career Development award provides funding to develop
              methods to support sound and rational decision making in complex, large-scale
              systems design.  The research initiatives include:  (1) developing game theory
              methods to model large-scale design problems that are being performed by
              multiple designers or design teams,(2) using statistical and probabilistic
              techniques to develop methods to approximate the decision interfaces among
              designers or subsystems, and (3) integrating modern operations research and
              visualization techniques into decision support tools to describe and predict
              the effects of various decisions on product performance and configuration.  The
              educational aims are to develop engineering design awareness and associated
              programs in local K-12 schools,  integrate systems design technology and
              techniques into the undergraduate and graduate curriculums,  and  continue to
              develop systems design distance learning courses utilizing network and
              multimedia capabilities at the University at Buffalo.
     If successful, the
              results of this research will lead to the capability to describe existing
              design process protocols, rapidly explore system decision tradeoffs, and
              predict the effects of different strategic decision structures.  The primary
              benefits of this research include allowing designers to quantify the interfaces
              in the design of large-scale systems.  These interfaces include the tradeoffs
              in integrating and coordinating multiple decision-makers or teams, functional
              interfaces between subsystems, and interfaces between temporal product
              realization stages, such as design and manufacturing.
