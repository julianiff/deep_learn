Abstract    :
              ***  9804690  Bryant  This activity will bring approximately twenty
              undergraduate  students in the physical sciences to the annual meeting of  the
              American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular,  and Optical Physics. 
              Attendance at the meeting will be  followed by a week of lectures on the themes
              of the meeting.  Attendees will be chosen from among those who will go on to 
              spend the balance of the summer in REU research activities.  The present
              activity will thus complement the research-  intensive activities of the REU
              Program.  ***
