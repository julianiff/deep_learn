Many minerals which are nominally anhydrous actually contain
              low concentrations of water or hydroxide bound in distinct sites in their
              structure.  These components influence the properties of the host phase to
an
              extent that is far disproportionate to their actual concentrations, and
              together, constitute a globally significant reservoir of hydrogen in planet
              Earth.  Our research program is directed at 1) characterizing the chemical form
              and concentrations of these components in natural minerals and related
              synthetic materials, 2) relating the hydrous components to other physical and
              chemical properties of the host phases, and 3) exploring the significance of
              the hydrous components to the terrestrial geologic system. We select naturally
              occurring minerals from a variety of geologic occurrences and characterize
              their hydrous components with infrared spectroscopy.  A subset of our samples
              will then be prepared for Nuclear Profile Analysis which can determine the
              absolute hydrogen content. Working curves will be prepared for major groups of
              minerals found in both Earths crust and mantle.  Synthetic minerals grown under
              controlled temperature and pressure
conditions and with known chemical
              components will provide standards for examining the influence of chemical
              composition upon the hydrous components.  They also will address the objective
              of relating information obtained from natural minerals to their conditions of
              formation.
