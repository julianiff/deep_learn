Abstract    :
              9804671  Luryi  This award is in support of a conference on the subject of
              "Future Trend in Microelectronics:  Off the Beaten Path".  The conference will
              be held in  Iledes Embiez  in France from May 31 to June 5, 1998.  The
              conference is a repeat of the NATO, 1995 workshop:  "The future of
              Microelectronics:  Reflections on the road to Nanotechnology".  The 1995
              workshop resulted in a book with the same title as the conference.  The
              conference was judged to be a great success.  The 1998 conference is in
              response to many suggestions and requests received by the organizers of the
              1995 conference.  ***
