Abstract    :
              Knowledge of the diets of our fossil ancestors can tell us much about their
              biology and ecology, and the sorts of foods modern humans are adapted to eat. 
              Recent studies of living primates have shown relationships between diet and
              patterns of microscopic wear on teeth, and that dental microwear can help
              reconstruct the diets of fossil species.   This study will involve a
              comprehensive analysis of dental microwear in our hominid forebearers dated to
              between 4.1 and 1.5 million years ago.  Nearly 1200 teeth will be examined and
              molded at museums in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa.  These teeth
              will be examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope.  Patterns of microscopic
              tooth wear will be quantified and compared among  the hominids and to a series
              of living primates to determine the diets of the fossil forms.  Results will
              provide new perspectives on key questions in human origins research. What role
              did diet play in the origins and early evolution of our family?  How did diet
              change through time in early hominid lineages?  Were there geographic
              differences in diet among the hominids? Did hominid species that lived in the
              same place in the time period differ in their diets?
