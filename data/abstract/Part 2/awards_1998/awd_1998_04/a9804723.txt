Hexavalent uranium (uranyl) minerals are common in the oxidized
              portions of U deposits, and are important for understanding water-rock
              interactions in U deposits, the mobility of actinides in the environment, the
              weathering of U mine and mill tailings, and the alteration of spent nuclear
              fuel in a geological repository. This study will focus on Pb uranyl oxide
              hydrate minerals that occur in the weathered portions of Precambrian U
              deposits, as well as in weathered mine tailings that result from the
              utilization of such resources. These structurally complex minerals contain
              several different sheets of uranyl polyhedra, with Pb cations and water
              molecules located in interlayer positions. Preliminary work has demonstrated
              that these minerals show considerable compositional variability within some of
              the structure types, and led to the hypothesis that anionic substitution in the
              sheets of uranyl polyhedra may be the charge-balancing mechanism that permits
              variation of the interlayer content. The Pb uranyl oxide hydrate minerals
              vandendriesscheite, fourmarierite, curite, richetite, sayrite, and wlsendorfite
              will be investigated using extensive crystallographic studies, microprobe
              analysis, and the synthesis of mineral analogues. These studies will provide
              the details of the crystal-chemical variability of these complex minerals. The
              results of the investigations will be used to extend the structural hierarchy
              of uranyl minerals, and to develop an understanding of the relationship between
              the structures and paragenesis of these and other low-temperature minerals.
