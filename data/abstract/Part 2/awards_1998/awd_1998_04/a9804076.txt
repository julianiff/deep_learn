Abstract    :
              9804076  Result checking of computations is investigated using a 
              certification-trail technique.  Certification trails offer an  effective and
              efficient alternative to result checking approaches  employing replication or
              N-version programming.  Certification-  trail techniques are designed to
              support a secondary computation  of a result by using the same input together
              with a special  output, the certification trail, utilized by the primary 
              computation.  By making use of the certification trail, the cost  of the check
              can be substantially less than that of the primary  computation.  This research
              extends the certification trail  technique to new application  domains,
              including important computationally intensive problems  for which best known
              solutions generally require extensive  computing time and commonly used systems
              programming operations.  The research also develops a distributed applet-based
              certifiable  processing technique which distributes computational problems to 
              clients across a network and then certifies the correctness of  the accumulated
              solution efficiently using certification trails.  Finally, by using properties
              of computations and solutions,  certification-trail techniques are  developed
              to support result checking with predetermined degrees  of correctness rather
              than total precision.  An important goal to  assure a significant impact of
              this research is to establish a  WWW library of certification-trail techniques
              and solutions for  general use by researchers and software developers.***
