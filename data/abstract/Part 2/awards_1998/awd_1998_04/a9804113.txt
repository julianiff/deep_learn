Abstract    :
              9804113  This research addresses two important problems in the design of  large
              and complex distributed software systems, namely: a) the  need to increase the
              reusability of software components by  reducing, or in some cases, eliminating
              their dependency on  interconnection patterns, and b) the need to establish
              confidence  that the final architecture will meet performance requirements by 
              the proper selection of interconnection patterns between atomic  components and
              aggregate components. More specifically, the  project focuses on the design of
              a language to describe the  architectural and performance characteristics of 
              components, connectors, and patterns of interconnected components  as
              architectural building blocks; the composition of patterns and  target system
              architectures from the building blocks; and  constraints on the composition of
              patterns and target system  architectures. This research also addresses
              developing a method  for mapping a target system to an analytic performance
              model used  to predict the performance of the target systems under various 
              workload intensity situations. By characterizing the performance  of components
              and their interactions, the overall performance of  the target system can be
              estimated. The biggest impact of this  research is in advancing the methods and
              software technology  needed to reduce the costs and risks in the software
              development  of large and complex distributed software systems.***
