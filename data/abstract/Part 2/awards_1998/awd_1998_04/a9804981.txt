Abstract    :
              This project will bring together specialists in the four fields of anthropology
              who have expertise in the regions of the Americas, Australia, and remote
              Oceania for a conference.  The purpose of the meeting is to compare the
              colonization of these three areas by a comparative examination of the
              archaeological, historical linguistic, biological and ethnological evidence. 
              They will criticize current theories of colonization, migration and expansion
              of human populations, and attempt a new synthesis.  They will examine cladistic
              versus reticulate theories of development and historical versus evolutionary
              theories, and they will search for recurrent behavioral processes typical of
              human entry into regions where there are no pre-existing human populations-new
              landscapes.  By employing a comparative method, the conference attendees hope
              to illuminate the central questions of whether language, culture and genotype
              co-evolve through time, or whether they are governed by different laws of
              evolutionary process.
