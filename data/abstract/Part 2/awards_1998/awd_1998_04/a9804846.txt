Abstract    :
              9804846  Li    Sparse polynomial systems occur frequently in a wide variety of 
              applications in sciences and engineering where the knowledge of all their  
              isolated solutions is essential. Practical evidence has shown  that homotopy
              continuation algorithms are efficient, reliable and  accurate in finding all
              the isolated zeros of polynomial systems.  Moreover, the method is inherently
              parallel and is therefore a natural  candidate for distributed processing
              architectures.    The proposed research is to be directed along several avenues
              in  solving polynomial systems by the newly emerged polyhedral homotopies. The 
              essence of the project is to develop efficient computational algorithms,  which
              involves a theoretical study of the method, investigation of the stability and
              efficiency of the algorithm, and benchmark testing for a wide range of
              problems. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a high-quality
              software package that can be used to solve large-scale real world applications
              on a wide variety of advanced architectures.
