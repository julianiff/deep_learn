Abstract    :
              9804817  O'Keefe    Proposed experimental work is aimed at the synthesis of new 
              materials with bonds to nitrogen and carbon,  involving the  p block metals
              (zinc, cadmium, gallium, indium, thallium,  silicon, germanium and tin).  This
              work is expected to lead  to new compositions with useful properties such as 
              microporous materials.  Other synthetic avenues to be  explored include ternary
              nitrides and nitride-carbides of  the early transition elements. 
              Characterization will  include powder neutron diffraction studies of
              orientational  order-disorder.  Theoretical studies will be directed to 
              topological aspects of structure, with a view to enabling  computer recognition
              of structures, and to the discovery of  new kinds of possible structures for
              covalent and framework  materials.  %%%  A program of synthesis of new
              inorganic materials is  proposed.  Particular emphasis is on compounds
              containing  carbon and nitrogen that have useful properties such as high 
              porosity which will make them candidates for a variety of  technological
              applications.  Parallel theoretical studies  will be aimed at the design of new
              structures that can be  realized as inorganic materials with novel properties
              such  as new kinds of semiconductors.  A unique aspect will be the  active
              interplay of these two components of research.  ***
