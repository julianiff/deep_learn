Abstract    :
              9804014  Reynolds  The main goal is the design of a purely functional 
              programming language with a sufficiently refined type  structure to give the
              programmer explicit control over  storage allocation. The proposed starting
              point is Benton's  logic LNL, which integrates the computational lambda 
              calculus of Moggi with a language using linear types. It  should be possible to
              implement a language based on LNL so  that linear values do not need garbage
              collection or  reference counts, and so that the user has explicit control 
              over the choices between linear and nonlinear values, and  between call by
              value and call by name. Further  possibilities include the ability to "freeze"
              a linear  structure temporarily (which would prohibit updating while 
              permitting multiple references), the inclusion of types for  specifying
              in-place algorithms, and an extension to permit  concurrent processes whose
              interaction can yield  nondeterminate results. Additional topics that may be 
              pursued are: the unification and generalization of  approaches to reasoning
              about side effects, aliasing, and  interference, the modeling of polymorphic
              types by means of  partial equivalence relations on Scott domains, and the 
              investigation of the relationship between partial  equivalence relations on
              domains and information systems.  ***
