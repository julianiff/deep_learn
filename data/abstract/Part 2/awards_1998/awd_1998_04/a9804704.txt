Abstract    :
              9804704  Bisset        The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and 
              experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Michael A. Bisset to work with  Professor
              Yu-Ping Kuang at Tsinghua University in Beijing,  China on the study of
              extensions to the Standard Model of  elementary particles, especially the
              spontaneous symmetry  breaking (Higgs) sector.  Dr. Bisset will pursue efforts
              to  systematically examine this sector in as model-independent  way as
              possible.  He is also going to look at Tsinghua  University's efforts to study
              the technicolor scenarios of  symmetry-breaking.    It is a unique opportunity
              for a Western physicist to be  invited to work at a university in China.  In
              addition to  working at Tsinghua, Dr. Bisset will be able to work with 
              researchers from Beijing University.    ***
