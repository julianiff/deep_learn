Abstract    :
              9804750  Carriquiry      This Americas Program award will fund a Latin American 
              workshop  on "Probability and Mathematical Statistics", to  be held in
              Cordoba,Argentina,  September 21-25, 1998,  in  conjunction with the
              Iberoamerican Congress of Statistics.  Organizers are Drs. Alicia Carriquiry,
              Iowa State  University, and Philip Protter, Purdue University, in 
              collaboration with Dr. Victor Yohai,  Universidad de Buenos  Aires. The 
              workshop will focus on the importance of  statistical science and probability
              as fundamental  components of scientific and social inquiry.    The main
              objectives will be to discuss new developments and  identify common research
              areas for international and Latin  American researchers  In order to achieve
              these objectives  participants will address  topics in statistics and 
              probability with wide application in other areas of  research.    Coinciding
              with the improvement of economic conditions in  Latin America during the past
              ten or fifteen years,  the  basic sciences have experienced a markedly
              improvement in  quantity and quality in the region.  Probability and 
              Mathematical  Statistics  are at the forefront of this forward movement, 
              mostly due to the regional and international collaborations  resulting from
              challenging problems in areas such as  environmental statistics, econometrics
              and social  statistics.  While not disregarding the more theoretical  aspects
              of probability and statistics, the emphasis of this  activity is on the
              application of the  mathematical sciences  to other areas of scientific and
              social inquiry,  highlighting methodology and interdisciplinary  collaboration.
