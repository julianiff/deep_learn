Abstract    :
              9804712  Selverstone   The assembly of continental crust of the American west
              during the proterozoic involves successive accretion of arc material from north
              to south, with early collision between the Colorado province and the Wyoming
              province, as marked by 1.4 Ga thrusting.  However, new evidence for even
              earlier polymetamorphism and strike slip translation has raised the possibility
              of significant complications to these accretion events.  This project will
              pursue these issues with an integrated kinematic, petrologic, geochronologic
              and isotopic study of the northern Front Range.  Results are expected to
              clarify early accretionary tectonics between the Colorado and Wyoming
              provinces.
