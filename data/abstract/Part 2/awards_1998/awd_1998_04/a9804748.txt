Abstract    :
              9804748  Gunzburger    This award provides support for a conference in   "Recent
              Trends and Advances in PDEs and Numerical PDEs" to be held   at Iowa State
              University between August 2-5, 1998 (dates to be confirmed).    Partial
              differential equations (PDEs) is the language of much of  science and
              engineering so that advances in PDEs and their  approximate solution are of
              continuing importance to applications.  The  general themes of the conference
              are recent advances and trends   in the theory and computation of PDEs,
              focusing on nonlinear models, algorithms,  and theoretical and computational
              results that are of importance in  applications. Interdisciplinary
              cross-fertilizations will be featured. This  aspect of the conference will
              especially benefit junior mathematicians who  will be exposed to the great
              variety of approaches and models that the  general PDE community has developed.
              A distinguished list of speakers will  be invited to the conference; there will
              also be ample time reserved for  young researchers to present their results.
              The featured speaker at the  conference will be Professor Olga Ladyzhenskaya of
              the Steklov Institute in  St. Petersburg, Russia. A discussion, led by notable
              researchers, about the  important trends that have been recently established
              and problems that the  PDE community should be addressing will take place. The
              conference should  be especially attractive to minorities and women. Speakers
              from these  groups, including the featured speaker, will be prominent at the
              conference  and help will be provided to junior participants representing these
              groups  for their expenses.
