Abstract    :
              In 1993, a group of French researchers announced the invention of 
              ``turbo-codes,'' a fundamentally new approach to the problem of  attaining near
              Shannon limit performance on a variety of  communications channel models. Many
              researchers believe that  turbo codes are the most important new idea in
              error-correcting  codes since Shannon's original paper. Professor McEliece's
              work  under this NSF grant is motivated by the desire to provide a  sound
              theoretical explanation for the experimentally verified  iterative turbo
              decoding algorithm, which is the key innovation  of the French group. 
              McEliece's research has led to the  discovery of a close connection between the
              turbo decoding  algorithm and a number of other algorithms known in the 
              cryptography, information theory, digital communications, signal  processing,
              statistics, and artificial intelligence communities.  McEliece and his
              co-workers have shown that all of these  algorithms can be unified by a single
              technique which he calls  the generalized distributive law, or GDL. In this
              work, the goal  is to exploit the GDL to (a) search for a theoretical
              explanation  of the turbo decoding algorithm, and (b) to devise new decoding 
              algorithms in non-turbo situations.
