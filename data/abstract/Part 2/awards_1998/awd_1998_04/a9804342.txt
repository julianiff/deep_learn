Abstract    :
                    ECS-9804342  Stephen D. Fantone    This is a proposal requesting support
              for student travel for 1998 Integrated Photonics Research Topical Meeting to be
              held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, March 30-April 3, 1998.    The
              subject matter to be addressed in the scope of this conference embraces
              research in important research areas that are growing rapidly as photonics and
              integrated optics play a major role in optical communications.  Integrated
              photonics promises to enhance the functionality of the optical components, to
              improve components reliability and to reduce the cost of manufacturing.  The
              funds granted to support this conference will be used for travel of graduate
              students with highest priority given to students who are presenting papers at
              the conference as first authors..  This is appropriate utilization of NSF
              funds, since the experience obtained in attending conferences are often
              invaluable to the graduate students in educational terms, in establishing
              professional contacts and in job searching.    I recommend an award to be made
              for the sum of $2,000 for this conference.
