Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed theoretical study is to make a significant step toward
              developing a 3D model of the Solar Wind interaction with the Local Interstellar
              Cloud.  A full model should include the effects of interstellar neutrals and
              plasma, galactic and anomalous cosmic rays, solar and interstellar magnetic
              fields, interstallar dust.  This is a very complicated problem, and the
              applicant will focus on interstellar atom flow modelling.  This modelling will
              be performed on the basis of numerical solution of the kinetic Boltzmann
              equation and the Monte-Carlo method.  The work will be done at the University 
              of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, under guidance of Principal
              Investigator Professor Mike Gruntman.
