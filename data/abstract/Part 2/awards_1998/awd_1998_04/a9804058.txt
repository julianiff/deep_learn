              Proposal Number: DMS 9804058  PI: David Ruppert  Institution: Cornell University
               Project: Nonparametric Regression     Abstract:     The research focuses on
              (a) fitting regression splines by penalized   methods, (b) Bayesian
              nonparametric inference using regression splines,  (c) multivariate regression
              splines with applications to stochastic   dynamic programming, and (d)
              bandwidth selection in local regression.    Regression is a statistical
              technique for discovering relationships   between variables, for example,
              percentage of saturated fat in one's   diet and the probability of cancer. 
              Regression is applied thoroughout   the sciences and engineering.  Modern
              regression methodology, including  this research, focuses on complex nonlinear
              relationships with large   numbers of variables.  A typical example would be
              estimation of credit   risk based upon an entire credit history and other
              financial variables   of a credit applicant.  This research will be on
              nonparametric   regression meaning that the form of the relationship must be
              discovered  from the data.  Nonparametric regression techniques are rapidly
              finding  applications in business under the name "data mining."  In a separate 
               project funded by the SRC, the research will be applied to the   improvement
              of tool utilization in semiconductor manufacturing.
