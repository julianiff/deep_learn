Gas bubbles in magmas are crucial to many processes, such as
              transferring metals from magmas to ore bodies, triggering and driving volcanic
              eruptions, and releasing gas to the atmosphere.  Despite their importance, only
              meager experimental data exists on bubble formation and interaction in magmas. 
              In order for gas to form bubbles in magmas and to escape to ore bodies, bubbles
              must nucleate, grow, and link up, to allow gas to migrate through the magma.
              This study will attempt to address this gap in our knowledge about the behavior
              of bubbles in magmas by experimentally examining nucleation and growth of
              bubbles in silicate melts using a wide range of gas compositions.  Some of the
              crucial questions that will be investigated are, what changes in magmatic
              conditions are needed to precipitate bubble nucleation and growth?, do bubbles
              nucleate heterogeneously or homogeneously?, what roles do different gas
              species, such as H2O, CO2, Cl, and S, play in degassing magmas?, and what
              volume percentage of bubbles is needed before bubbles can interact?  By
              addressing these questions, fundamental new insights will be gained on magma
              degassing and, thus, on process controlling volcanic eruptions and ore body
              formation, and on the influence of volcanic eruptions on the atmosphere.
