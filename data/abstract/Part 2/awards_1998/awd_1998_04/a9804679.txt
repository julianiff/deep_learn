Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop scalable, automated  methods to design
              high-performance embedded systems - particularly  those with real-time latency
              and throughput requirements.  In such  systems, computations flow through
              heterogeneous interacting  components, which are managed by local
              resource-schedulers and  drivers.  Hence, a key design problem is that of
              balancing and  tuning the local resource-managers, so that they collaboratively
               meet the global end-to-end performance objectives. The proposed  approach
              involves parametrically transforming the end-to-end  constraints into local
              (per-component) constraints, and then  solving them for optimal on-line
              performance.  Specifically, the  method works by (1) extracting performance
              models for key stages  along the all data paths; (2) hierarchically grouping
              the per-  component models into larger system-level prototypes; and (3)  using
              the system-level models to help calibrate the local resource  management
              policies. Step (3) is called "design synthesis."  To  carry it out, the
              proposed method relies on off-line algorithms to  synthesize optimal CPU/IO
              bandwidth allocations for all pipeline  stages. After synthesis, the analytic
              estimates are checked via  simulation. Then the system is integrated, and
              rechecked via on-  line benchmarking. Two reference applications are proposed
              to  validate this framework: (1) A software realization of a large-  scale
              radar signal processor, to be run on several workstation-  clusters; and (2) a
              video server system connected via 100Mbs  partitioned Ethernet.
