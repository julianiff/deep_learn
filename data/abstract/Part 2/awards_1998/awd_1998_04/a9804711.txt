ODP Site 983 and Site 984 , located on drift sites south of
              Iceland, have yielded high fidelity (u-channel) records of geomagnetic secular
              variation and geomagnetic paleointensity in the Brunhes Chron, and of polarity
              transitions at the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary and the top of the Jaramillo
              Subchron.  This proposal is to extend the record through the Matuyama Chron at
              Site 983 and Site 984 where sedimentation rates are 12-17 cm/kyr, and to embark
              on the study of Brunhes-Matuyama records from sites 980, 981 and 982 located on
              neighboring sediment  drifts.  The objectives are to correlate geomagnetic
              secular variation records and paleointensity records to the oxygen isotope
              records, which are already available for most of these sites, and to study
              polarity transitions records from the top of the Olduvai to the
              Brunhes-Matuyama boundary including the Cobb Mt. and other short events
              (Gilsa?) which appear in the shipboard pass-through records.  All studies will
              be carried out on 2*2 cm u-channels affording much improved resolution over the
              shipboard data and allowing measurement of laboratory induced magnetizations
              (ARM, IRM) for constructing of paleointensity and grain size proxies.  The data
              will allow further evaluation of the potential of paleointensity records as a
              means of millennial-scale correlation and will yield new high resolution
              records of geomagnetic field behavior in the Matuyama Chron.
