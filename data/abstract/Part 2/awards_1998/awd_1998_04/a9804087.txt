Abstract    :
              9804087  Data abstraction is of central concern in program design while 
              ``parametricity'' is a mathematical formalization of this  concept. Using
              parametricity, one can argue that two program  modules that export types and
              operations are equivalent as long  as the behavior observable by client
              programs is the same. In  this project, Prof. Uday Reddy addresses key issues
              of  parametricity theory in joint research with Prof. Peter O'Hearn  at Queen
              Mary and Westfield, London. The issues addressed include  finding an abstract
              framework for parametricity that encompasses  various programming language
              phenomena and their mathematical  models, integrating parametricity with
              subtyping  type systems, and the application of these results for modeling 
              object-oriented programming with mutable state. The research  spans theoretical
              and practical issues, ranging from abstract  categorical frameworks to type
              systems and practical reasoning  principles. The issues addressed are of vital
              importance for  integrating parametricity with the vast body of programming 
              theory developed over the years. Prof. O'Hearn's expertise in  parametricity
              theory will complement Reddy's work in the study of  data abstraction aspects
              of local variables. This collaboration  enhances their research effectiveness
              in addressing issues of  mutual interest.***
