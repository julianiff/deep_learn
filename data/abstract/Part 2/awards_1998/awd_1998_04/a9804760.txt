Abstract    :
              Information theory celebrates its 50-th birthday.   Although it  is a mature
              area of research by any standard, new challenges  arise due to new applications
              and new theoretical developments.  (For example, there is a resurgence of
              interest in source coding  for multimedia applications.)  In the 1997 Shannon 
              Lecture Jacob  Ziv presented compelling arguments for "backing off" to a
              certain  degree from the (first-order) asymptotic analysis of information 
              systems in order to predict the behavior of real systems where we  always face
              finite (and often small) lengths of sequences, files,  codes, etc.   One way to
              overcome these difficulties is to  increase the accuracy of asymptotic analysis
              by replacing first-  order analyses (e.g., a leading term of the average code
              length)  by full asymptotic expansions and more accurate analyses (e.g.,  large
              deviations, central limit laws).  We propose to accomplish  this goal by
              exploring problems of information theory by analytic  methods, that is, those
              in which complex analysis plays a pivotal  role.  Among others we propose
              research on lossless Lempel-Ziv  schemes, lossy extension of Lempel-Ziv schemes
              (based on  approximate pattern matching), context quantization (which aims  at
              extending context-tree weighting to the lossy environment),  prediction schemes
              based on pattern matching, and hierarchy of  redundancy rates.  Analytic
              methods discussed here are:  asymptotic analysis of functional-differential
              equations,  poissonization and depoissonization, and complex asymptotics.
