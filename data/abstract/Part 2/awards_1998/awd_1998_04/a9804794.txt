There are two main thrusts in this broad-based experimental
              investigation of kinetic phenomena in materials of the Earth's crust and upper
              mantle: studies of lattice diffusion in minerals and of textural aspects of
              fluid-bearing and partially-molten rocks. The diffusion studies focus upon
              intracrystalline transport of key trace elements and radiogenic isotopes (e.g.,
              Pb, Sr, rare earths) in major rock-forming minerals (olivine, pyroxene,
              garnet), and also upon specific phenomena such as the isotopic (mass) effect on
              diffusion and diffusion in the near-surface region (i.e., the outermost 10-100
              monolayers). The textural studies are aimed at evaluating the importance of
              interfacial energy minimization in determining the manner in a which a fluid
              phase is distributed between mineralogically distinct units in close proximity
              to one another (i.e., fluid "partitioning"), and also at understanding the
              coarsening behavior of mineral grains in the presence of a small amount of
              fluid. Ultimately, it is hoped that the diffusion data will place time and
              temperature constraints on inter-mineral isotopic and trace-element
              equilibration, and that the textural information will help petrologists and
              geochemists deduce the nature of fluid- and melt-rock interaction at depth in
              the Earth.
