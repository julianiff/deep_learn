Abstract    :
              9804700  Mun  The general objective of the workshop is to delineate new 
              research directions in biomedical engineering and computer  science to develop
              the devices and intelligent systems  required for image-guided surgical
              procedures for the spinal  column and the spinal cord.    The specific
              objective of the workshop is to produce a  technical requirements document for
              minimally invasive image  guided therapy for spine applications.  This
              objective will  be achieved through the following steps.    Step One.  Define
              the current status and clinical needs in  Image-Guided Therapy (IGT).    Step
              Two.  Identify areas for improvements in IGT: Clinical  analysis.    Step
              Three.  Define technical requirements and new tools for  IGT: Engineering
              analysis.    Step Four.  Configure the diagnosis and therapy team for IGT  of
              the future.  ***
