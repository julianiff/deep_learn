Abstract    :
              9804851  Kent   The J1 cusp is a prominent feature of the apparent polar wander
              path for North America.  It is interpreted to mark a change in plate motion for
              North America, but the timing and amount of change are controversial mainly
              because much of the data comes from the Colorado plateau, which may well have
              been notated since the Mesozoic.  This project will attempt to document the J1
              cusp in the Hartford Basin, where there should be no rotation since
              emplacement.  Results should help resolve the ambiguity inherent in the present
              status of the J1 cusp and allow a more robust Mesozoic reconstructions for the
              Jurassic.
