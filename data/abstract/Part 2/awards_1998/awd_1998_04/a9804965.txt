Abstract    :
              9804965  Kodama   Sedimentary compaction may cause the remanent magnetism,
              acquired during sedimentation, to be significantly shallowed, resulting in
              incorrectly low paleolatitudes if not recognized.  This project will examine
              inclination shallowing phenomena associated with chemical remanence in the
              laboratory and in a field example in China.  Results are expected to clarify
              under what circumstances a chemical remanence can be affected by subsequent
              sedimentary compaction and to provide guidelines for recognition and possibly
              correction.
