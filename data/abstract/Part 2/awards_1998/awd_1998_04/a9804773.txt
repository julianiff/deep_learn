Abstract    :
              98-04773  Barron    Funds  are  requested  to support a five  day  oceanographic
               cruise  to  enable a group of "Discover Earth"  teachers  to  learn   about  
              oceanographic   research   techniques    and  procedures.   The cruise will
              occur in the vicinity  of  the  Georges  Bank during the summer of 1998.  This 
              cruise  will  give  teachers  the experience of planning,  executing,  and 
              interpreting the results of an integrated scientific  study,  with  the
              objective of transferring this experience to their  classrooms.
