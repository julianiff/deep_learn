Abstract    :
              This project will involve the study of nuclear reactions primarily utilizing
              unstable nuclei, i.e. radioactive nuclear beams (RNBs).  It will also involve
              the development of new types of instrumentation, techniques and apparatus to
              facilitate these studies.  The latter will include the development and
              utilization of special superconducting-magnet ion-optical systems together with
              detector systems optimized for nuclear-reaction studies involving short-lived
              nuclear beams such as Lithium-8, Helium-6 and metastable ions (Fluorine 18-m). 
              Specific experiments will include studies related to nuclear astrophysics (the
              synthesis of elements in stars, the solar-neutrino and missing-mass problems,
              supernova and the Big Bang), and the special structure of very neutron-rich and
              proton-rich nuclei (Lithium-8, Helium-6,...).  The work will involve both
              graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and
              elsewhere and faculty members from several institutions.  The work will exploit
              the unique capabilities of the new double-solenoid RNB apparatus recently
              installed at the University of Notre Dame accelerator as part of a joint UM-UND
              project.  Additional research will be done at the nearby National
              Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University.
