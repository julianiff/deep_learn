Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9804122  Lila Fishman    This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1998.  This 
              fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional
              scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and
              imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled genetic  mechanisms and
              consequences of mating system divergence in  the Mimulus guttatus species
              complex: a case study of  adaptive evolution. This project addresses
              fundamental  questions about the action and interaction of genes of major 
              effect in adaptive evolution. Introgression lines based on a  linkage map of
              quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in  mating system divergence in Mimulus
              will be used to estimate  direct and epistatic effects on floral morphology,
              mating  behavior, and fitness. Measures of male fitness define the  genetic
              constraints on the selfer transmission advantage  assumed by most models of
              mating system evolution. The  research also evaluates the impact of the
              observed genetic  architecture on the speciation process by measuring 
              reproductive isolation between divergent taxa.
