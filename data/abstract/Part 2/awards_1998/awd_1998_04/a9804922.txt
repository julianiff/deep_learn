The proposed project intends to explore undergraduate
              students' learning of physics using two specific instructional technologies,
              microcomputer-based laboratories and digital video analysis of experimental
              data.  It comprises work to be done over a two-year period, based at the
              University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in collaboration with the Univesite de
              Montreal.  It is expected that this work will lead to the development of
              further projects.  The goal is to contribute to the growing but still
              insufficient knowledge available to physics educators and college decision
              makers on the benefits of instructional approaches that include these
              technologies for teaching and learning complex physics content and general
              science skills.
