Abstract    :
                       ***           Li           9804886                This Small Business
              Technology Transfer Phase II project is to conduct there search and development
              for a novel method of producing graded index, perfluorinated plastic optical
              fiber.  This fiber will be able to transmit several Gigabits per second over
              one kilometer.  At present, most local area networks (LAN's) are being
              installed at 100 Mb/sec.  Within two years time, there will be a general shift
              of 1 Gigabit/sec for new installations.  After the year 2000, it is anticipated
              that many LAN installations will routinely require several Gigabit/sec at
              distances up to 1000 m.  Only glass or perfluorinated plastic fiber will meet
              this specification.  There are three principal research objectives.  Within a
              contractual research agreement with DuPont, that company will provide
              appropriate perfluorinated materials to Nanoptics, and the optimal choice of
              polymeric material will be decided upon.  Secondly, a prototype facility for
              producing 10 kilometer lengths of fiber will be designed, built, and brought
              into operation at Nanoptics, Inc.  Finally, the fiber will be fully
              characterized, and the production method will be optimized accordingly. 
              Recently, Asahi Glass Co., has announced that it will introduce a similar
              polymeric product in the year 2000 for the multibillion dollar LAN market.  The
              novel production method by Nanoptics should make the proposed product very cost
              competitive.               The new international for digital products (TV,
              computer, audio, FAX, etc) for the home will require a 800 Mb/sec deliver
              system for the street into the home.  The extreme chemical and moisture
              resistance, coupled with freedom from electromagnetic interference offered by
              the product should permit its broad acceptance into this potentially huge world
              wide market.    ***
