Successful reform in mathematics education requires the
              integration of research and theory drawn from different fields.  From our
              perspective, changing schools requires working with both teachers and students,
              with content and children's thinking, and with tools and how they are used, all
              concurrently.  In the past, researchers engaged in understanding reform often
              studied either teachers or learners, content or children's thinking, tools or
              their use.  These researchers provide a rich source of knowldege about these
              issues; we draw upon their work to create a model, GAMES, for both teacher and
              student development that integrates these different areas and addresses them
              concurrently.
