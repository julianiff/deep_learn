Abstract    :
              9804067  Managing the process of developing and maintaining software has  become
              the focus of organizations that need to deliver reliable  software in a
              cost-effective manner. To this end, two orthogonal  directions have been
              pursued: industry has developed standards,  while academic research efforts
              have focussed on formal models.  The goal of this research is to integrate
              these two approaches  through data analysis and measurement. In this project,
              new  techniques are devised for combining process data analysis with  process
              models, including analysis of concurrent behavior,  attribute relations, and
              real-time performance of processes. In  addition, an existing framework for
              process data analysis is  extended to provide support for these new methods,
              and tools are  constructed embodying these new techniques. Evaluation of the
              new  methods is undertaken by applying them to industrial, real-world  data, in
              conjunction with industrial collaboration. Providing  these techniques will
              empower those who develop software to  maintain truly optimizing
              processes---the rigorous framework of a  formal model allows the data analysis
              to measure the process in  an unambiguous manner, thus feeding back clear and
              insightful  information to the process. In addition to this practical impact, 
              this project will enhance and extend the  scientific knowledge of the process
              of developing reliable  software systems.***
