Abstract    :
                One of the most exciting developments of the last two decades in  the theory
              of error-correcting codes has been the discovery of a  new class of linear
              codes called algebraic-geometric (AG) codes.  AG codes are known to be more
              effective than the widely-used Reed-  Solomon codes, as they offer greater
              flexibility in the choice of  code parameters.  Moreover, it has been proven
              that there are  sequences of AG codes that exceed the Gilbert-Varshamov bound; 
              however, the explicit construction of such AG codes has been an  active
              research topic and is still an open problem.    In this project, the following
              problems are explored: (1) to  investigate the explicit construction of
              sequences of  asymptotically good AG codes; and (2) to investigate these 
              constructions to obtain asymptotically good AG codes that exceed  the
              Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes over GF(q^2), where q is no  less than seven.
