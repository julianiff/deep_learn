This research consists of a joint observational and
              theoretical investigation of the spatio-temporal pattern of earthquake
              aftershocks.  This will be a test of the critical point model in which, on a
              plate boundary scale, the crust is not in a continuous state of self-organized
              criticality but repeatedly approaches and retreats from the critical state. 
              Evidence for this includes the power law increase in regional activity observed
              to precede many large events and the regional quiescence, which follows.  The
              power law increase is sometimes modulated by a log-periodic fluctuation.  If
              the critical point model is a valid representation for seismicity, then power
              law scaling should also be observed in the aftershock sequence following large
              events.  This is seen in the form of Omori's Law.  The results should improve
              understanding of the physical origin of log periodic fluctuations and the
              relationship between the critical point model and other recent theoretical
              models of aftershocks, which also yield Omori's Law.  This research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
