Abstract    :
              9804994  Johnson  The objective of this research by Aimee Johnson is to
              investigate loosely Bernoulli Z^d dynamical systems. This work will build on
              the result of D. Ornstein which states that weakly Bernoulli systems can be
              completely characterized, up to isomorphism, by their entropy. Ornstein's
              result uses the d-bar-metric, and Ornstein, D. Rudolph, and B. weiss
              characterize the classification theory brought about when this is replaced with
              the f-bar-metric. Their work involves 1-dimensional actions and the purpose of
              this research is to generalize these results to higher dimensions. In
              particular, one objective is to show that higher dimensional loosely Bernoulli
              systems are the distinguished class for the higher dimensional version of even
              Kakutani equivalence, which is known to be true in 1-dimension. This
              equivalence theory will be useful in investigating properties of general
              dynamical systems. Johnson has already worked in this area in joint work with
              Ayse Sahin, giving a zero entropy definition of loosely Bernoulli and
              developing technical lemmas which have proven to be helpful in showing when a
              system is loosely Bernoulli. Another objective of this research is to provide
              more examples of loosely Bernoulli systems, thus increasing the accessibility
              of this field.
