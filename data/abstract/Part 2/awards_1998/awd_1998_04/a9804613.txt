Abstract    :
              9804613

This GOALI project is a university-industry cooperation between the
              Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering of the
              University of Colorado and the Applied Sciences Division of Weidlinger
              Associates, Los Altos, California.  The main purpose of the proposed
              cooperation is to develop a set of models for the analysis and design of
              reinforced concrete structures reinforced and/or retrofitted using Fiber
              Reinforced Plastic materials.  Such models are almost nonexistent for
              structures that use FRP materials in the form of either reinforcing bars or
              mats and jackets.  The proposed project intends to bridge the existing
              gap.


Two families of models will be developed, one geared toward the
              nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of frames, the other for the detailed
              analysis of structural elements, joints and design details.  A library
              ofconstitutive laws will complement the element development and will constitute
              a major contribution of the proposed research.  New constitutive laws will be
              proposed and implemented for FRP materials and for concrete confined by FRP
              mats or jackets.  The new laws will be implemented in both solid elements and
              beam-type elements that include the effect of shear deformations and shear
              failure under cyclic loads.
