Abstract    :
              9804662  Mairson, Harry G.  Brandeis University    CISE PostDoc: Design and
              Analysis of Symmetric, Hybrid Procedure-Calling Protocols    This research has
              the ultimate goal of increasing the effective functionality of programming
              languages without sacrificing practical efficiency concerns. To this effect,
              the PI and Postdoctoral Associate intend to design, analyze, and implement a
              novel prototype procedure-calling protocol for programming languages,
              integrating the components of correctness, optimality, and symmetry.  A correct
              implementation never diverges on procedure inputs that are not used; an optimal
              implementation never ``duplicates work'' by copying unevaluated procedure
              calls.  A symmetric implementation facilitates programming with values and
              continuations in an identical manner.  The fundamental approach carries over to
              any language that has standard procedure-calling protocols.    This hybrid
              protocol encompasses the best features of call-by-value and call-by-name,
              together with a facility by which values and control contexts can be
              manipulated in an entirely dual fashion.  The technology that supports the
              implementation depends on basic ideas from graph reduction, as reinterpreted
              using very recent new ideas about optimal evaluation.  We intend to implement a
              prototype version of this protocol on top of the Scheme language.  Several
              technical and implementation questions remain to be resolved in order that we
              may bring this idea from concept to implementation.
