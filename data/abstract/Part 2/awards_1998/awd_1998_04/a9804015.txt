Abstract    :
              This grant supports substantial participation and leadership  by this group in
              the Brookhaven AGS experiment E850 (Color  Transparency).  It also supports
              participation in the  polarized proton experiments within the STAR
              collaboration  at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.  E850 will study the 
              quantum fluctuations of the strongly interacting nucleon  state with
              measurements of high momentum transfer quasi-  elastic scattering in nuclei at
              beam energies from 6 to 20  GeV and with a variety of nuclear targets.
              Selecting events  with hard hadron-nucleon primary interactions, measurements 
              of Color  Transparency will characterize the dependence of  secondary nuclear
              interactions upon energy and scattering  angle.  This experiment also provides
              unique measurements of  the light cone nucleon distributions in nuclei. In
              parallel,  data suggesting evidence for observable short range nucleon- 
              nucleon correlation in (p,2p+n) measurements will be  collected and analyzed.
