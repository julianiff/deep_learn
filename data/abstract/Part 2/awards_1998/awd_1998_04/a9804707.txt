Abstract    :
              This  work addresses the need for a deeper understanding of human  communication
              in situations where more than one channel and  mode  are  employed.  The
              context in which this problem will be studied  involves human-machine and
              human-human communication when one  of  the  users is deaf-blind.  This student
              and another undergraduate  student are working on the project with the
              investigator using  a  process  known as scenario-based design.  Of particular 
              interest  is  the  use  of  typing and synthetic speech for  production  of 
              messages  by  the  deaf-blind user, and  speech  recognition  and  Braille  for
               the  reception  of  the  partner's  side   of   the  conversation.  A
              portable, prototype system will be  created  and  evaluated in the setting of
              the University campus.  The  work  is  done  in the experimental undergraduate
              laboratory known  as  the  Idea  Factory, developed to encourage students with 
              disabiliites  to pursue the study of science, engineering, and mathematics.
