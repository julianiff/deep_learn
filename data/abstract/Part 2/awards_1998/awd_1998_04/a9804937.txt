Abstract    :
              MCB9804937      This award is to provide partial support for the  8th
              International Conference on the Cell and   Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas,
              to be held in Tahoe City, California on June 2-7, 1998.   Since its inception
              in 1983, this now biennial conference has brought together American and  
              foreign investigators from a variety of disciplines to discuss current studies
              on this organism.   Chlamydomonas has been a favorite model organism to study
              such topics as cell motility,   organelle heredity, gamete differentiation,
              cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cell fusion.    Although Chlamydomonas
              investigators individually attend many other conferences, this   conference is
              the only meeting that brings together most of these investigators to focus on
              the   specific biological questions of their shared interest.  Interactions
              among these scientists at this   meeting, as in the past, should be
              particularly useful in providing rapid dissemination of new   information,
              technological breakthroughs, and developing, widely applicable methodologies.  
               The conference is also likely to be important in establishing fruitful
              collaborations and for the   exchange of mutants and molecular probes which
              should promote the rapid advance of research   on this organism.  Furthermore,
              the conference will provide an invaluable opportunity for   students and young
              investigators who attend to share in the excitement and new knowledge in   this
              field.  To promote this last aim, the award will be used specifically to
              support the attendance   of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and needy
              young faculty.
