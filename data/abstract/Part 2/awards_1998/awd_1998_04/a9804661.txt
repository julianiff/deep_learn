Abstract    :
              This award subsidizes the registration fees to allow graduate  students to
              attend the 1998 annual meeting of the Society for  Behavioral
              Neuroendocrinology, a new society dealing with research  on hormonal
              interactions with brain and behavior.  The meetings  foster cross-disciplinary
              discussions of topics such as behavioral  ecology, chronobiology, developmental
              and physiological  psychology, genetics, neuroscience and cellular and
              molecular  endocrinology.  The society is in a period of rapid growth.     This
              support will have an impact on exposing a number of  students to such important
              cross-disciplinary research, which will  be important to shaping their careers.
