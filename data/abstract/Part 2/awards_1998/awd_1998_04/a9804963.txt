This study is designed to shed light on processes that deposit
              gold in Carlin-type deposits, which are the main source of gold outside South
              Africa. Gold in these deposits is found in arsenic-rich pyrite that is
              disseminated throughout the host rocks. Previous work at one deposit, Twin
              Creeks, shows that: 1) iron in mineralized rocks with high concentrations of
              gold is in pyrite, 2) iron in barren rock that lacks gold is in minerals other
              than pyrite, and 3) iron contents of mineralized and barren rocks are the same.
              These relations suggest that iron in mineralized rocks was converted to pyrite
              and that this caused gold deposition by the process known as sulfidation. The
              present study will attempt to determine whether sulfidation took place at other
              Carlin-type deposits and whether this is a general mechanism for deposition of
              gold in these deposits. This study also will test preliminary observations at
              Twin Creeks which suggest that the distribution of ferroan dolomite in
              sedimentary rocks reflects their post-depositional history. The results of this
              research will be useful in guiding exploration for new Carlin-type deposits.
