Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9804178  Eric S. Post    This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1998.  This 
              fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional
              scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and
              imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled reproductive  strategies of
              plants and red deer in response to global  climatic variation.  Databases on
              reproduction containing 50  years of data on plants and 30 years on red deer in
              Norway  are being analyzed to reveal how long-term variation in  global climate
              related to the North Atlantic Oscillation  (NAO) have affected these 2
              interacting species. The results  will inform our understanding of reproductive
              responses of  plants and vertebrates in local populations to large-scale 
              variation in climate and can be used to predict their  responses to global
              climate change.
