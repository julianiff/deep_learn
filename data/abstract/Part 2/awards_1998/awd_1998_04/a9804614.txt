Abstract    :
              9804614  Sommer    Treasuring our Natural Heritage: Natural History and
              Environmental Science Education is a multifaceted project that will be
              developed by the Idaho Museum of Natural History. Their goal is to heighten an
              understanding of issues surrounding the concept of biodiversity among the
              general public.  By using the metaphor " the economy of nature," they will
              present three concepts: biodiversity which will include the idea of keystone
              species, natural capital, and extinction debt & conservation biology.  This
              approach and the use of this metaphor is based on pre-exhibit research work
              that demonstrated that rural Idahoans understand this as a system of exchange,
              where each species holds a different 'occupation' and a variety of occupations
              is critical to the health of the economy.  This project will bring participants
              in touch with the value of scientific research through presentations by
              scientists whose recent research results will provide a deeper understanding of
              the living systems around them.  Views of elders from Idaho's Native American
              tribes will be included to add a critical human dimension.  With this award
              they will develop a series of three small traveling exhibits, three-part
              educational video series for public broadcasting, and three multimedia science
              kits for use by children's groups on each of the three concepts noted above. 
              With this multifaceted design it is anticipated that this program will reach
              50% of Idaho's 1.2 million people.  It is anticipated that the exhibits will
              become generally available once they have completed their circulation in Idaho.
