Abstract    :
              9804318  Myers    ABSTRACT: Miami University, in conjunction with the National
              Science Teachers Association, is producing an inquiry-driven science program
              for use in informal settings.  A key component of the program will an Internet
              component with a web page that complements and supports the existing Dragonfly
              magazine and the Dragonfly pilot television program that is being produced
              under a separate grant.  The web page follows the same themes as the magazine
              and provides scientific information, an educational interactive experience, a
              sidebar of interesting information about topics, and advice about how users can
              investigate themes further themselves off-line.  Other Dragonfly Quest
              components will include a leader's guide for educators in informal settings,
              and educator's companion, a Dragonfly Pocket Field Book with challenges to
              engage youth in investigations in the field, and Dragonfly badges,
              certificates, and notebooks.    Dragonfly Quest clubs will be established at
              200 Boys & Girls Clubs (B&GC) of America chapters nationwide.  The B&GC are
              making a major effort to see that their chapters having computer and Internet
              capabilities available to the participants.  Currently, approximately 40% of
              the 2000 chapters are linked to the Internet.  The chapters with computers
              selected for this project each will all have at least four computers for youth
              - all capable of running browser software at the level Netscape 3.0. 
              Assessment of the effectiveness of the project will be carried out at all 200
              clubs.   Thhe evaluation will be conducted at 160 clubs with Internet access
              and 40 clubs without Internet access to evaluate the added-value component of
              the web pages relative to the other elements of the Dragonfly Quest package.
