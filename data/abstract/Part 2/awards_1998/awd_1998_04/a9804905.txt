Until recently, high-precision geodetic observations from
              Mexico have been unavailable for treating many first-order questions regarding
              the neotectonics of Mexico.  The P.I.'s will analyze previously inaccessible
              data from a network of 15 GPS receivers that span Mexico.  These receivers have
              been operated continuously since early 1993 by Mexico's National Institute of
              Statistics, Geography, and Computer Science (INEGI).  The immense INEGI GPS
              data archive is a lodestone of information about the present-day tectonics of
              Mexico that will provide the team with a unique set of five-year-average
              velocities that will used to investigate the bounds on motion of Mexico
              relative to the rigid North American plate, the nature of slip across the
              Trans-Mexican volcanic belt, motion of Baja California relative to the Pacific
              plate, and the evolution of Pacific-North America motion since 3.16 Ma.
