This research involves the study of the lateral and radial
              distributions of anomalous S-wave speeds (Vs) in the transition zone beneath
              the northern Philippine Sea and the back-arc region of the Tonga subduction
              zone.  In both regions, pronounced anomalies of fast P-wave speeds (Vp) have
              been taken as evidence for remnants of subducted pacific lithosphere that
              remain stagnant, at least temporarily, in the transition zone of the mantle. 
              Results from the proposed research will offer a rare opportunity to compare the
              distribution and magnitude of anomalies in both Vs and Vp, forming constraints
              for understanding the nature of the anomalous bodies.  This work is motivated
              by two observations.  First, scattered, deep-focus seismicity off the inclined
              Tonga Wadati-Benioff zone lacks a corresponding anomaly in Vp, suggesting that
              the effect of cold temperature, which should raise Vp, is counteracted by
              compositional or mineralogical effects.  Second, Vs may be highly anisotropic
              near the source regions of this scattered seismicity in the transition zone. 
              Thus, links will be sought between the deep seismicity and anomalies in
              Poisson's ratio or in anisotropy of Vs.
