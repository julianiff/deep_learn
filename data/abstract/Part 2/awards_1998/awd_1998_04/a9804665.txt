Abstract    :
              9804665  This project will develop a new programming and specification  language
              for distributed systems, IOA, with explicit support for  parallel composition
              and levels of abstraction.  It will also  develop computer tools to manipulate
              programs and descriptions  written in the IOA language; such tools will include
              a simulator,  interfaces to existing theorem-provers and model-checkers, and a 
              real code-generator.  The language and all the tools will rest  firmly upon a
              previously-developed mathematical foundation  consisting of input/output
              automata.  They will enable the  production of running systems that are
              provably correct, relative  to assumptions about externally-provided system
              services. These  tools will be built and tested using examples chosen from the 
              area of high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed systems,  with particular
              emphasis on group communication services and  distributed shared memory
              services."***
