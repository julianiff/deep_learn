This grant will support in situ measurements of the mechanical
              properties of an active fault zone (the San Andreas fault in southern
              California).  The measurements are made using a long-base laser strainemeter to
              measure the earth tides inside the fault zone, which are compared against the
              tides expected for a homogeneous Earth.  Differences between the measured and
              predicted tides indicate that the fault zone has different elastic properties
              than the material around it.  This project was originally supported by EAR
              Instruments and Facilities, which supported construction of a "portable"
              strainmeter for measuring tides.  This first installation showed clear evidence
              of tidal distortion; the present grant is to relocate the strainmeter to a new
              azimuth, so as to determine the full strain tensor and better constrain the
              nature of the fault zone elastic properties.
