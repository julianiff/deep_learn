This project addresses the origin of xenolithic eclogites and
              their role in the formation of Archean continents. The work is undertaken
              collaboratively with Prof. S. Haggerty (UMass), J. Valley (Univ. Wisconsin), R.
              Carlson (DTM) and H. Rollinson (Cheltenham) and will focus on eclogites and
              tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorites (TTGs) from the Archean Man shield, west
              Africa.  Laser ablation trace element data, stable isotope data and Re-Os and
              U-Pb zircon geochronology will be employed to 1) test the hypothetical
              connection between eclogites in mantle roots and Archean TTGs in the overlying
              crust, 2) produce a comprehensive chemical and isotopic database with which to
              evaluate the origin of xenolithic eclogites, 3) evaluate the importance of
              mantle metasomatism in producing the observed eclogite compositions and, 4)
              place better constraints on the processes of Archean continental growth and
              evolution.
