Convection in the mantles of terrestrial planets is
              extremely vigorous (high Rayleigh number), and it occurs with negligible
              influence from inertial forces (zero Reynolds number or infinite Prandtl
              number).  Although modern computer models now approach this fluid dynamic
              regime, almost no relevant laboratory experiments have been performed.  The
              P.I.'s propose to construct a very large tank to study convection at high
              Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, using fluids with strong temperature-dependence
              of viscosity and differing densities to simulate a variety of processes
              considered important in the Earth's internal dynamics.  These processes include
              mixing of various geochemical components by mantle convection, and the
              influence of convection on continental dynamics. They will employ new digital
              video imaging techniques to measure the flow and temperature fields in the
              tank, simultaneously producing a series of films illustrating the various fluid
              dynamic processes involved in mantle convection.  They also propose to carry
              out direct comparisons of laboratory and numerical models of convection in
              order to provide much better experimental verification of results from
              large-scale computation.
