Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to study complexity issues, develop  algorithms,
              and perform experiments with adaptive data  compression algorithms, both
              lossless and lossy. We build upon  our previous research and continue a blend
              of theoretical and  experimental work.  We are interested in methods that both 
              compress well and can be implemented to run in real-time in high  bandwidth
              applications where robustness with respect to channel  errors / storage
              corruption may be required. General areas of  research addressed are error
              resilience, 2D lossless compression,  adaptive methods for (lossy) image and
              video compression,  parallel algorithms and architectures, and automated
              browsing  based upon the "learning" employed by adaptive compression  methods.
