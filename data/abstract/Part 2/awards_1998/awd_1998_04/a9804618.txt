              ABSTRACT    Surfactants are used in every major industry of modern society. The
              aim of this Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced
              Studies on Novel Surfactants (IUCS) at the Columbia University is to develop a
              knowledge base on the relationship between the structures of different
              surfactants and their performance in various manufacturing systems, products
              and devices.  Modification of classical surfactants with specific functional
              groups so that their surface, micellar, membrane, and adsorption activities are
              enhanced or controlled will be one of the approaches in the development of
              novel surfactants.
