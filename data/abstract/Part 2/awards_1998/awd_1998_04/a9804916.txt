The volatile characteristics of ocean basalts provide key
              constraints on the geodynamic evolution of the Earth.  This research will
              address these issues through an integrated study of the He-Ne-Ar-H2O-CO2
              isotope and concentration systematics of oceanic basalts erupted within the
              Manus Basin (Bismark Sea) back-arc basin.  All analyses will be undertaken on
              samples well-characterized for their major and trace element chemistry and
              radiogenic isotope characteristics.  The objectives of the work are three-fold:
               (1) resolution of the major and rare gas volatile systematics of the Manus
              Basin into their component parts indicating derivation from or association with
              hotspot, MORB, arc and back-arc mantle and/or basaltic crust of the basin
              floor; (2) consideration of the effects of magmatic degassing on the volatile
              systematics of oceanic basalts through a comparison of samples having
              experienced varying degrees of degassing. Monitoring of the CO2/3He ratio as a
              function of degassing history is a particularly relevant parameter in this
              respect; and (3) evaluation of the utility of laser extraction methods for both
              rare gases and major volatiles by a comparison with data on the same samples
              obtained by conventional crushing and stepped-heating techniques.  In
              particular, an attempt will be made to calibrate the length-scale of volatile
              heterogeneity (vesicles versus matrix) obtained by the different methods.
