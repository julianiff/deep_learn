I propose a species-level analysis of Middle Cambrian
              Ptychagnostidae (Trilobita, Agnostida) in order to test hypotheses relating
              microevolutionary attributes of species to macroevolutionary pattern within
              this clade.  Specifically, I aim to measure phenotypic variability and document
              the geographic and stratigraphic ranges of all species of Ptychagnostidae based
              on literature, museum, and field collections.  The role of these attributes in
              determining the number of descendants of a species will be assessed in the
              context of a phylogeny constructed using the cladogram of Westrop et al. (1996)
              and the stratigraphic occurrence of taxa.  A literature-based database is
              currently being constructed, yet robust measures of phenotypic variability
              require large samples of specimens available in museum collections and
              supplemented by additional field collections.  The proposed project will build
              upon extensive prior research on Middle Cambrian Ptychagnostidae and will
              specifically address the hypotheses that: 1) levels of phenotypic variability
              and the geographic and stratigraphic range of a species are correlated with the
              number of descendants produced by a species, and 2) the distribution of species
              of Ptychagnostidae within a morphospace should be constant in order to avoid
              competition while minimizing evolutionary differentiation.  The evaluation of
              these hypotheses has great significance for understanding both the evolutionary
              dynamics of the Ptychagnostidae and the tempo and mode of evolution during the
              Cambrian radiation of marine invertebrates and during other intervals of Earth
              history.
