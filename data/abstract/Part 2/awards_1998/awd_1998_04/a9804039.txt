Abstract    :
              9804039  Mintz    The Whitaker Center for Science and Arts will develop two
              versions of an exhibit Bodies in Motion: The Physics of Human Movement.  The
              Whitaker Center is a new cultural center to be centrally located in Harrisburg,
              PA and has as its theme "science through the arts."  In keeping with that
              focus, this will be a highly interactive 2000 sq. ft. exhibit which will
              provide experiences that reveal the physics embodied in dance, ice skating,
              gymnastics, and other sports.  Two versions of the exhibit will be developed,
              one will be for the Whitaker Center (2000 sq. ft.) and the other (1500 sq. ft.)
              will travel to small science centers and children's museums.  The core physics
              concepts to be explored are mass, inertia, force, speed and velocity,
              acceleration, torque, momentum, angular momentum, centrifugal and centripetal
              force, kinetic and potential energy, gravity, and Newton's Laws of Motion.  By
              means of the exhibits learners will explore such topics as the role of torque
              and rotational momentum in turns, how dancers manipulate their center of
              gravity to create the illusion of floating during leaps, and how physics
              illuminate the differences between dance and ice skating.  There will be a
              series of complementary programs which include lecture/demonstrations by Dr.
              Kenneth Laws, a physicist who studies the physics of dance; teacher education
              programs; support materials for classroom use; professional development
              programs for teachers; and a brochure on physics and dance for distribution to
              dance schools.
