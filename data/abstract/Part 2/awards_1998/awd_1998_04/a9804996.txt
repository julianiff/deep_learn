A novel method is proposed for estimating
              ground heat flux, sensible heat flux and evaporation at the surface from time
              series of soil variables and atmospheric variables.  The method eliminates the
              need of estimating gradients required by most existing algorithms to obtain
              surface fluxes.  It achieves this objective by exploiting diffusion analogies
              to the vertical movement of heat and moisture in the soil and atmosphere.  In
              such cases the vertical gradient of a scalar variable can be expressed as the
              half order time derivative of the variable, which in turn is a weighted
              integral of the time series of the variable in question at the interface
              between the soil and the atmosphere.  Proof-of-concept has been achieved but
              there are many outstanding issues and need for extensive verification with
              field data.  Some of the questions yet to be addressed include: 1. properly
              representing parameters that may be soil, vegetation or state dependent; 2.
              expanding the concept to estimating fluxes over regions, and properly handling
              the heterogeneity of properties in that case; 3. explore the robustness of the
              assumptions of the method.
T'his work promises to: 1. enhance our ability to
              utilize remotely sensed
observations to quantify surface hydrometeorological
              fluxes; 2. improve ability to quantify regional energy balances; 3. suggest
              better parameterizations of global atmospheric and land models.
