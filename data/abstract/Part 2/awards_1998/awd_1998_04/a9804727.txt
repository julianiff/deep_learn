Abstract    :
              9804727  Kiani  Support is provided for the "First Tennessee Conference on 
              Biomedical Engineering", to be held on 4-5 April, 1998 on  the campus of the
              University of Tennessee, Memphis.  The  theme of the conference is "Engineering
              the Future of  Healthcare in Tennessee".  The theme was developed from a 
              recognition of the need to foster collaborative efforts  between industrial,
              academic, and clinical institutions that  are involved in biomedical
              engineering, and to increase the  awareness of biomedical engineering related
              activities in  the state of Tennessee.  Information about the meeting is 
              disseminated through an Internet WEB page at URL  http://bme.utmem.edu/~tnbme/.
                 The primary objective of the meeting is to initiate a  process to increase
              the awareness of biomedical engineering  activities in Tennessee on the part of
              industrial, academic,  and clinical institutions.  The organizers place special
               importance on attracting students and industrial  representatives to the
              meeting.  The final report of the  conference will include conference
              proceedings, a report by  the Evaluation Committee concerning the feasibility
              of  holding future meetings, and the results of a survey of the  participants
              concerning their satisfaction with the meeting.  ***
