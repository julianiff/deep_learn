Abstract    :
              Wireless ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has been proposed  for the next
              generation multimedia wireless networks.  Originally developed for channels
              with wide bandwidth at  high signal-to-noise ratio, ATM in a wireless
              environment  faces the difficult challenge that wireless channels are  time
              varying. The success of wireless ATM, to a great  extent, hinges upon the
              design of adaptive receivers that  are able to mitigate time varying channel
              impairments.  This research focuses on adaptive signal processing  techniques
              for channel estimation and equalization in an  asynchronous time division
              multiple access (TDMA) network.  The objective of the investigation is to
              explore new  approaches that minimize the overhead associated with the 
              transmission of training signals. By exploiting jointly the  structure of the
              data packet (e.g. ATM cell), the protocol  of medium access control, and
              spatial-temporal diversities  of the signal, the investigators are developing
              new channel  estimation and equalization algorithms that have rapid 
              convergence rates and low power VLSI implementation.
