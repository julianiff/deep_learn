Abstract    :
              The investigator, with several students, uses the Arecibo Versatile Toroidal
              Facility (VTF) in laboratory simulation experiments to study the role of lower
              hybrid waves in ionospheric plasma modifications.  In recent experiments, the
              spectrum of Langmuir waves combines the PDI decay spectrum and a different
              decay spectrum.  This new decay spectrum may stem from parametric decay of
              O-mode wave; compared with the PDI process, it requires a higher threshold,
              exceeded by the newly upgraded Arecibo heater.  Using the 'tilted' HF heater,
              the PI aims to understand the physical mechanisms of HF heater-enhanced
              Langmuir wave turbulence.
