Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9804251  Kristina Stinson    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying
              the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled exploring life  on the edge:  are
              marginal populations likely sources of  variation for range expansion?  This
              investigation seeks to  determine whether or not plant populations at the edges
              of a  species's range contribute to the gene pool and therefore  potentially
              expand a species's ecological niche through  adaptation to a wider range of
              conditions.  The work  combines genetic analyses with controlled-environment
              and  transplant experiments to determine the relative roles  played by local
              adaptation, plasticity, and the originating  population's genetic composition
              on the expansion of  marginal populations.  Kobresia myosuroroides
              (Cyperaceae),  the dominant species of dry alpine woodland meadows of south- 
              central Colorado, is the plant being studied.
