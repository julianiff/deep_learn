This research involves the one-year deployment of portable
              PASSCAL seismograph stations in eastern Turkey to investigate the
              Eurasian/Arabian plate margin across the Bitlis suture and East Anatolian
              Fault. The experiment and subsequent data analyses will be a joint, cooperative
              project between Cornell University and Turkish scientists from Kandilli
              Seismological Observatory.  The methods used to study the data will include
              teleseismic and regional waveform modeling, travel-time tomography, hypocenter
              location inversion, and shear-wave splitting analysis.  The results of applying
              these techniques to the broadband data will allow an inference of the rheology,
              thickness, and deformation of the Anatolian crust and lithosphere.  One of the
              least understood processes within the framework of plate tectonics is the
              mechanism for continent-continent collision, yet this process plays a critical
              role in the development and growth of the continents on earth. This seismically
              active area generates considerable earthquake hazard.  This research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
