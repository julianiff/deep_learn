This research is to complete analysis on coral data gathered
              earlier between the western coast of Sumatra and the trench of the Sumatran
              subduction zone, 240km offshore.  The samples consist of slabs of head corals
              that record sea-level changes caused by tectonic deformation related to
              earthquake occurrence.  The nature of earthquake recurrence is poorly
              understood, in large part because physical models are constrained inadequately
              by sparse paleoseismic and paleogeodetic records and by instrumental data. 
              This work has shown that coral "microatolls" offer an unrivalled opportunity to
              test models of earthquake recurrence, because they record vertical deformation
              through several large-earthquake cycles quite precisely in their morphology and
              annual banding.  On the islands of the outer-arc Sumatran ridge, 120 to 130km
              from the trench and about 25km above the subduction interface, this project has
              revealed a sudden emergence of about 2 meters during the giant earthquake of
              1833 and during two earlier events about AD 1608 and 1380.  This implies 10 to
              13 meters of slip on the subduction interface during each of these events. 
              There is also evidence of episodic, interseismic submergence of the islands at
              rates that increase trenchward from about 4 to about 10 mm/yr, averaged over
              the past several decades and in the decades prior to each large earthquake. 
              This grant will support further documentation and extension of these results. 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.
