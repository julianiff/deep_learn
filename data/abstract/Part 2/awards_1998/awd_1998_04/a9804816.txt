Abstract    :
              9804816  Kurtz   The Summer Intern Program in Probability and Stochastic
              Processes is designed to   stimulate and encourage the scientific development
              of young researchers in the area.  The   participants will spend the summer 
              together in Madison, Wisconsin, in day-to-day   interaction with  senior
              researchers from  the University of Wisconsin as well as  with   senior
              visitors.  Participants  will benefit from access to  the major research
              library and   other research facilities at the  University, opportunities to
              establish continuing contacts   and collaboration with the other participants
              in the program, and  advice and support in   developing long term research
              programs.
