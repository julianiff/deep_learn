Sediments deposited in basins undergo physical and chemical
              changes-diagenesis-and gradually evolve into sedimentary rocks.  This project
              is an experimental study that simulates diagenesis in the laboratory with the
              goal of understanding the various physico-chemical processes involved.  The
              emphasis is on studying the evolution of porosity and permeability during
              diagenesis in order to understand the formation of seals in sedimentary basins.
               Such seals are widespread and they play important roles in the migration and
              entrapment of oil and gas.
