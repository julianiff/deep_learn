Educational reform efforts at both the National and State
              levels have mandated changes in science education intended to promote a deeper
              understanding of scientific concepts through an inquiry approach.  Yet there is
              little documentation how teachers, who are involved in districts affiliated
              with systemic reform efforts, are making sense of this call to inquiry.  How do
              teachers intepret this mandate and how does it express itself in their
              pedagogical practices, their use of curriculum, and in their assessment of
              students learning?
