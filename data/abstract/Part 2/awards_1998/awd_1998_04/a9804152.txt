Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences
              Related to the Environment for 1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity
              for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral
              degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental
              mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment
              at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem
              level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological
              Sciences of the National Science Foundation.  Each fellowship supports a
              research  and training plan to be carried out  in a sponsoring laboratory.  The
               research and training plan for this  fellowship is entitled regulation  of
              gene expression in learning and  memory.  The overall objective is  to
              understand the biochemistry of  learning and memory, behaviors  crucial to all
              animals and an  important aspect of how organisms  interact with the
              environment.  Transcription is the first step in  gene expression and is the
              starting  point for this study.  Previous  studies on the role of 
              transcription in learning and  memory have relied on simple cell-  based
              systems where the interplay  between transcription and behavior  could not be
              studied.   This  research investigates how  transcription related to learning 
              and memory is regulated in a whole  organism, the fruit fly Drosophila.
