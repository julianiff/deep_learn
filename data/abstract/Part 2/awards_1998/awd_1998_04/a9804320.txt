	This grant will support studies using the upgraded DO
              detector at the FERMILAB Tevatron.  At the Tevatron protons and anti-protons
              are collided at the highest energies currently available in the world.  The
              experimenters are also helping to construct the CMS detector which will take
              data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  This collider will take over the
              energy frontier from Fermilab around 2005.  The collisions at these colliders
              produce many different types of particles which can be revealed by studying the
              signals they leave behind in the detectors.  The experimenters study these
              signals in the hope of finding evidence of new types of particles not
              previously seen.
	The Higgs is one such particle which experimenters are
              looking for.  The detection of this particle will help physicists to
              explain/understand why particles have mass.  The experimenters may also find
              evidence for supersymmetric particles.
