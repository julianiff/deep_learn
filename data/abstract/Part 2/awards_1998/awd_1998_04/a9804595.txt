Abstract    :
              9804595  Hall    Recent work in Dr. Hall's laboratory has provided evidence
              which suggests that the recognition and binding of mammalian sperm to the
              cellular coating of an egg called the zona pollucida (ZP) is mediated by
              specific sugar molecules on the surface of the egg's cellular coating and that
              an enzyme, N-acetyl-B-D-hexosaminadase B, is involved in this stage of the
              fertilization process.  He postulates that the binding of the sperm enzyme to
              the egg's sugar molecules forms an enzyme-sugar complex that may mediate the
              "tight" binding between the sperm and the egg.  Since no X-ray crystallographic
              structure of the sperm enzyme is available, the proposed study would further
              our understanding of this stage of the fertilization process, namely, sperm-egg
              recognition and binding.  The information acquired from this study would allow
              the design and synthesis of specific sugar analogs that could be potent
              inhibitors of the fertilization process and lead to the development of a
              sperm-directed male contraceptive.
