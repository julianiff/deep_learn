      The timing of melt extraction in the subcontinental
              lithospheric mantle (SCLM) underlying regions of Proterozoic and Phanerozoic
              crust in the western United States is largely unknown.   Distinctions between
              metasomatism of the SCLM via fluids and melts derived from subducting slabs,
              and the processes resulting in formation of OIB-type mantle domains, remain
              unclear.  As a first step to alleviate some of the ambiguity, recent
              investigations have identified several compositional parameters that are unique
              to subduction-related metasomatism.  These include high oxygen fugacities
              relative to oceanic and cratonic mantle, suprachondritic 187Os/188Os, and heavy
              34S/32S.  Some OIB-type mantle domains may have suprachondritic 186Os/188Os
              ratios.  Therefore, these data combined with other geochemical parameters may
              discern between subduction zone metasomatism and OIB-type compositional
              enrichments within the SCLM.  To address the timing of melting and the
              processes that modified the SCLM associated with Proterozoic and Phanerozoic
              crust, we will obtain 187Re-187Os, 190Pt-186Os and 34S/32S isotopic data on
              mantle xenoliths from the western United States.  We will use negative thermal
              ionization mass spectrometry to obtain Os isotopic data.  Bulk rock S isotopic
              data will be obtained using gas source mass spectrometry, and in situ S
              isotopes will be obtained by secondary ionization mass spectrometry.
