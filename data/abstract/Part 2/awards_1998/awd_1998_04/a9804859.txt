This research is a continuation of a project whose goal is
              to combine the mathematical expertise available at the International Institute
              of Earthquake Prediction Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, Russian Academy of
              Sciences, Moscow, with the evolving physics research in this country on
              complexity.  The Moscow group is a world leader in statistical studies of
              seismicity.  The PI is a leader in the discovery of new approaches to complex
              physical systems; especially self-organized criticality as applied to regional
              seismicity.  Some of the results thus far include 1)  a systematic test of the
              intermediate-term earthquake prediction algorithms previously developed by the
              group with notable successes, 2) development of an earthquake
              mechanism-seismicity model that exhibits useful properties that can be tested
              with seismic data, and 3) development of a uniform seismic hazard methodology
              model.  Future work will continue the seismicity-earthquake dynamics modeling,
              extend the intermediate-term earthquake prediction algorithms, and develop new
              short-term prediction algorithms within the intermediate-term prediction
              alarms.  The goals are to advance our understanding of earthquake mechanics,
              improve earthquake hazard assessment, and advance earthquake prediction
              techniques.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.
