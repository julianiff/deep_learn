Abstract    :
              9804078  Current software design doctrine rests on largely structural  concepts:
              information hiding, spiral processes, delaying  decisions, program families,
              reuse, etc. These idiosyncratic  concepts are not explained or unified by
              scientific theory or  mathematical models. At their heart is a common emphasis
              on  flexibility in software products and processes. Flexibility  incurs costs,
              e.g., as investments in architecture. What has  remained unclear, even in
              principle, is what flexibility is  worth, on what parameters and relations its
              value depends, and  thus under what circumstances investments in it are
              warranted.  This work will appeal to the theory of real options in an attempt 
              to develop a scientific account of the value of  flexibility as a framework for
              understanding important software  design principles. Real options theory models
              the value of  flexibility in capital budgeting and corporate strategy through 
              analogies with financial options, such as call options on stocks.  Conditions
              for using arbitrage-based pricing are unlikely to hold  for many design
              decisions, so valuations will  sometimes depend on subjective estimates of
              parameters. Even so,  the real options view appears to provide an intellectual 
              framework within which designers can reason about the value of  flexibility as
              afforded by such mechanisms as modularity and  phased project structures.***
