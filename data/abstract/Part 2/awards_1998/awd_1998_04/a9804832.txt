Abstract    :
              Moore  9804832    This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Andrew Moore at
              the Disaster Control Research Center (DCRC),  Tohoku University in Sendai,
              Japan.  Dr. Moore will work  with Dr. Fumihiko Imamura, Professor DCRC, on a
              research  project entitled, "Experimental Modeling of Sandy Tsunami  Deposits."
                 Several recent tsunamis have highlighted the fact that one  of the most
              persistent records of the passage of a tsunami  is the sandy debris it leaves
              behind.  These tsunami  deposits are often the only evidence scientists have
              that  prehistoric tsunamis once struck a coast.  The proposed  research is
              designed to determine the general features of  tsunami deposits, including
              overall geometry, sedimentary  structures, and grain-size patterns.  This
              information can  be used to help identify prehistoric tsunami deposits, and  to
              allow estimation of the size and speed of tsunamis from  their deposits.  The
              research involves producing small  tsunamis in a laboratory wave tank and
              determining how  changes in wave height, wave velocity, particle size, and 
              particle density affect the features of tsunami deposits.  ***
