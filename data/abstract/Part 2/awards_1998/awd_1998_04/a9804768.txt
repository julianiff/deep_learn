Site assignment of atoms in crystals with multiply-occupied
              atomic sites can be determined uniquely using the bond valence method.  We find
              that site assignments in which the weighted calculated valence sums are closest
              to the weighted formal valences yield excellent agreement with the chemical
              analysis.  For any crystal, the method requires structure data and electron
              count for the sites in question; furthermore, if chemical analyses are
              available, these data may be incorporated into the method. The method minimizes
              the sum of squares of the difference between observed and calculated bond
              valence sums and observed and calculated electron occupancy by varying the
              fractional site occupancy for each potential substituent; terms for modeling
              chemical analyses can also be added, and the optimum solution is calculated by
              minimizing valence energy.  Granted funds will be used to evaluate the model
              itself and test it extensively on mineral examples.  Furthermore, because the
              student supported by the requested funds is returning to science after a
              disabling stroke, an important outcome of the research will be observations of
              enabling science to the disabled.
