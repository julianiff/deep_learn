Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Nathanson will continue his investigations of gas-liquid
              interactions.  In this research a monoenergetic beam of atoms or molecules is
              directed at a liquid surface in vacuum, and the identity, translational energy
              and direction of the scattered products is monitored using time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry (TOFMS).  Information on energy transfer, reaction probability vs.
              impact energy or direction, and the identity of the desorbed reaction products
              is obtained.  Nathanson will study liquids spanning 35 decades in acidity.  In
              one set of experiments involving azeotropic sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid,
              neutral and basic solutions of glycerol or molten sodium hydroxide, he will
              investigate the dependence of energy dissipation and trapping on incoming
              trajectory of a gas molecule and the fate of the molecule as a function of
              acidity.  He also plans to examine the role of monolayers and their effect on
              energy transfer and penetration of the surface.

Chemical reaction dynamics
              at liquid-vapor interfaces is of direct relevance for understanding many
              different gas-liquid reactions, including ozone-hole formation important in
              atmospheric chemistry,  industrial processes using catalysts, and respiration
              in living organisms.
