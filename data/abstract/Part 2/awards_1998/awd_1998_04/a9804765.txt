Abstract    :
              9804765  Van der Voo    A rock magnetic and electron microscope investigation,
              using  convergent beam electron diffraction, is proposed for iron  titanium
              oxides in ocean-floor basalts that vary between  Recent and Jurassic in age, to
              determine the causes of the  observed changes in intensity of marine magnetic
              anomalies  and to examine their implications for paleo-intensity  studies. 
              Previously, the reduced magnetic intensity of  older ocean-floor basalts was
              thought to be due to  maghemitization, but recent observations have raised 
              questions about this mechanism.  If it can be shown that  fine-grained
              titanomagnetite has not always been oxidized in  older basalts, then it may
              well be a source of information  about ancient geomagnetic intensities. 
              Because ocean-floor  basalts are abundant for times since 150 Ma, unoxidized 
              titanomagnetites could become a promising tool for paleo  intensity
              determinations.=20
