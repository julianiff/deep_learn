Abstract    :
              It has become commonplace to read claims that one should not take the best
              available scientific theories as giving literal accounts of the world.  Many
              such arguments rest upon various sorts of perspectivalism that deny unique
              epistemic warrant to the theoretical conclusions of science.  But when it comes
              to foundational theories of physics, there are a number of grounds for
              skepticism that are more pertinent than those arising from the various
              methodological relativisms currently in fashion.  For example, physical
              theories often posit rich relationships among unobservable entities and
              properties.  Further, such theories also generally apply only to idealized
              systems, which are never encountered in the world.  Finally, it is often
              claimed that such theories are in flux, subject to correction, or soon to be
              replaced by even better theories.  This project addresses such fundamental
              philosophical questions about the status of physical theories, replacing
              general comments about the unreal abstractness and temporary character of such
              theories with a far more substantial analysis that is embedded within the
              context of particular theories.  This move makes the argument far more
              concrete, convincing and useful than the looser generalities.
