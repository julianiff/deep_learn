     This proposal requests an Accomplishment Based Renewal
              for continued support of our application of the Re-Os isotope system to
              problems concerning the geochemical evolution of the solid Earth.  We will
              focus on: 1) Delineation of the importance of mafic components (pyroxenites,
              eclogites) in the mantle sources of mid-ocean ridge basalts and mafic-potassic
              volcanism from Italy, the Colorado Plateau and southwestern Africa.  2) Re-Os
              age dating of sulfide inclusions in diamonds from the Slave craton and N.W.
              Australia.  3)  Extend our studies of the Re-Os systematics of cratonic mantle
              peridotite xenoliths to China and west Africa.  4) Examine the Re-Os
              systematics of lower crustal garnet granulite xenoliths from Minas Gerais,
              Brazil to define the chronology of crust formation in this area.  5)  Study the
              Re-Os system of the eclogitic and peridotitic rocks of the Dabie and Su-Lu
              terranes in eastern China to date the igneous formation of these materials and
              to examine the behavior of Re and Os during high-grade metamorphism.  6) 
              Improve the understanding of the behavior of the platinum group elements
              (PGE's) during igneous differentiation by measuring whole rock PGE patterns by
              isotope dilution ICP-MS in most of the samples studied for Re-Os isotopic
              variation.
