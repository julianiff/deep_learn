In this continuation of an earlier project (EAR-9506045) at
              10 kbar pressure, we will study experimentally the melting systematics of the
              Earth's mantle at 20 kbar pressure, using natural minerals as starting
              materials and layers of vitreous carbon spheres as a melt sinks within our
              graphite-lined Pt capsules. Our goal is to assess the effects of variable mode
              and compositional fertility on the solidus temperatures of different types of
              mantle, the near-solidus melt compositions, and the rates of melt productivity
              with increasing temperature. We will study eight starting materials constructed
              from hand-picked mineral separates: four from a fertile spinel lherzolite
              xenolith and four others from an compositionally intermediate spinel
              lherzolite. Modes will approximate "average" mantle, and mantle that is
              enriched in clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, or Cr-spinel.
