KLINE    

The Self Reliance Foundation, the fiscal agent for the
              Hispanic Radio Network, is producing a weekly, live, one-hour Spanish radio
              talk show.  The show would introduce audiences to current breakthroughs in the
              sciences through science updates, interviews with research scientists and
              educators, and audience call-ins.  The editorial plan is that approximately 20%
              of the topics for the interview/call-in part of the show will fall within five
              general categories:  Breakthroughs in Science, Opportunities in Science,
              Science and the Environment, Science and Health, and Technology.       

The
              PI would be Jeff Kline, President of the Self Reliance Foundation.  The
              Producer and Co-Project Director would be Javier Sierra, the Washington, DC,
              Bureau Chief for the Self Reliance Foundation.  They would work closely with an
              advisory committee of approximately 15 Hispanic scientists and heads of
              organizations serving the Hispanic communities.
