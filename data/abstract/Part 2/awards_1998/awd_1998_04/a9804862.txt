This research involves the investigation of volcanic magma
              bodies by means of new, precision earthquake location methods.  Earlier studies
              of the seismicity related to volcanic activity usually showed a diffuse zone of
              earthquake hypocenters surrounding hypothesized magma chambers.  More recent
              investigations on the island of Hawaii show that, after precision earthquake
              relocation, seismicity is highly concentrated in pencil-thin zones along the
              top-edges of magma-filled fractures.  This technique is now to be applied in
              this research to other volcanic targets with pre-existing seismic data
              including Rabaul caldera, Mauna Loa volcano, Campi Flegrei caldera, and
              Pinatubo volcano.  The study will result in comparative analyses of seismically
              active structures related to the magmatic "plumbing systems" of a range of
              volcanic structures. In addition, the relocated earthquakes will be used as
              well-located "source arrays" to identify reflected phases from suspected magma
              bodies.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.
