Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9804266  Lee Ann Meisel    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying
              the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled Arabidopsis  mutants disrupted in
              light and sucrose response pathways.  Light is a fundamental environmental cue
              utilized by plants  to signal a variety of morphological and metabolic 
              processes. Sucrose, a product of light regulated  photosynthesis, has feed-back
              activity by suppressing light-  activated genes. The asparagine synthase gene
              (ASI) is  repressed by both light and sucrose. This unique repressive 
              regulation by both light and sucrose on the AS1 promoter is  being used in a
              positive selection. strategy to isolate  mutations in the light and sucrose
              signal transduction  pathways.
