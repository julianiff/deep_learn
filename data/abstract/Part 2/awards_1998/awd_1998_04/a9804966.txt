This grant is to partially support travel of U.S. scientists
              to the 22nd International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be held on
              July 12-17 in Cambridge, England.  The conference meets every two years in
              different countries and is sponsored by the Committee on Mathematical
              Geophysics of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.  The
              conference themes will be magnetic field generation and core dynamics, large
              scale mantle convection, small scale processes in the mantle, atmospheric
              dynamics and secular variations, ocean circulation-climate processes, crustal
              processes, geophysical inverse theory, and modern numerical
              investigations.
