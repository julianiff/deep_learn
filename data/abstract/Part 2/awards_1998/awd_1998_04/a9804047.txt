In this proposal, a group of researchers from Vanderbilt
              University request funds to participate in experimental programs at Fermilab
              directed to the study of heavy quarks, specifically the b and c quarks.  These
              experiments, FOCUS now and BTEV in the future, will investigate the symmetry
              violation between matter and anti-matter known as CP.
