Abstract    :
              This project will study the structure of atomic nuclei at the limits of
              elongation and stability.  Highly elongated, or superdeformed, shapes of nuclei
              near lead will be studied by measuring magnetic moments of these excitations,
              studying the decay of these shapes to excitations with normal deformations, and
              extending the search for these shapes to systems which are highly likely to
              fission.  The structure of nuclei near the region where decay by proton
              emission can occur will be probed by studying the magnetic moments of the
              ground states and the excitations built on isomers which decay by emitting a
              proton or alpha particle.  Techniques will be developed for future studies of
              nuclear magnetic properties of nuclei far from stability produced as
              radioactive ion beams.
