Abstract    :
                Humans and other primates have complex dentitions, consisting of teeth of
              various numbers, types, shapes, and sizes.  An important problem in the basic
              nature of biological development, is to understand the genetic basis for how
              such structures are produced.  We cannot ethically work directly on primates
              because the critical developmental events take place in the embryo.  However,
              this problem can be studied in the laboratory mouse.  We and others have
              identified genes that are expressed in developing mouse teeth, and will use
              various experimental methods to inactivate these genes to determine their role
              in the process.  In addition, we will be taking a modern DNA sequencing
              approach (called EST identification), to find genes that are expressed in
              developing incisors or molars, but not both, and hence may help determine the
              type of tooth.  The expression of these genes in developing tooth germs will be
              characterized.  Because mice have incomplete dentitions we cannot translate
              findings in them automatically to humans or related primates.  However, we will
              be looking at the expression of the same genes in the laboratory possum, which
              does have a complete dentition, similar to humans and other primates, to
              identify constant elements in dental patterning which we might then study in
              humans in various ways (not part of this project).   Generally, we expect this
              work will lead to an understanding of how the dentition, or other similarly
              complex traits, are produced in an embryo and how they vary among species.
