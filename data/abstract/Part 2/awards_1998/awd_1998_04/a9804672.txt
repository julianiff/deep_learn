Abstract    :
              The main goal of this research is to learn more about the equation of state of
              nuclear matter.  That is to say, scientists wish to know whether the nucleus
              behaves more like a liquid or gas at various temperatures and pressures.  The
              data analysis will be performed locally at Saint Mary's College of California. 
              Saint Mary's is a small, liberal arts college, and this project will provide a
              unique opportunity for undergraduates to be involved in a large-scale,
              high-energy experiment.  The collaboration involves ten institutions from the
              U.S. and two from abroad.  In the main part of this project, students together
              with their faculty advisor will study the patterns created by the trajectories
              of emitted particles.  From these patterns, information about the state of the
              nucleus can be inferred.
