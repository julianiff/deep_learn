Abstract    :
              There has been an increasing need of highly predictable, timely, and dependable
              communication services with QoS guarantees on an end-to-end basis either for
              embedded real-time applications or for multimedia-integrated distributed
              control.  In particular, the RSVP Working Group of the IETF has developed a
              resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) protocol to provide receiver-initiated
              setup of resource reservations for unicast/multicast data flows.  RSVP supports
              receiver-initiated, fixed/shared reservation styles under the assumption that a
              underlying routing protocol is available to provide unicast routes/multicast
              trees with sufficient resources to maintain adequate QoS.  Unfortunately, most
              of the currently operational multicast routing protocols do not explicitly
              support QoS (in the form of end-to-end delay bound, end-to-end
              inter-destination delay jitter bound, and minimum guaranteed bandwidth).  The
              goal of the proposed research is thus to develop and evaluate a QoS routing
              framework and its associated admission control, member join/leave procedures,
              and information update procedures, to allow deployment of QoS routing
              capabilities in core-based multicast routing protocols.    The proposed
              research is a combination of two synergistic components: establishment of
              theoretical base for, and development of, all the component schemes in a
              well-defined analytic framework and their validation with software system
              building and experiments.  We will pursue this research by (i) devising
              effective admission tests to verify whether or not a multicast group member may
              join the multicast tree, while not violating existing QoS guarantees to other
              on-tree members; (ii) investigating the minimum set of information/state
              required for admission tests in the context of the controlled-load service and
              the guaranteed QoS service with various reservation styles as proposed in RSVP;
              (iii) developing (with consideration of the scalability issue) effective
              information update and state refresh procedures that can be read ily integrated
              with the soft state refresh echanism that exist in most multicast routing
              protocols that exploit the soft state concept; and   (iv) building an
              experimental software using the GateD multicast source codes distributed by
              Merit Network, Inc., defining and implementing a rich, well-defined interface
              with RSVP (which may require minor changes in RSRR, the routing interface for
              RSVP), and developing application level libraries to exploit the proposed
              services to provide a suite of multicast services with different levels of QoS.
