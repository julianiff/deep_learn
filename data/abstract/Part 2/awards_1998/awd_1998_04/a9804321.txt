Abstract    :
                9804321  Storm  The  Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to
              discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science.
              Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of 
              established  scientists, young investigators who are making important
              contributions  in  these  areas,  and  post doctoral fellows.  They  are 
              usually held in small isolated  New England towns away from other distractions
              and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas. Recently some conferences have
              also been held in Europe. These conferences have a recognized value for
              presenting  the  latest advances in research and also indicating the future
              trends in research which are likely to be most productive.  ***
