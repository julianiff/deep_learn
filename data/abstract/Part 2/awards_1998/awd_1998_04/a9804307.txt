This project involves a study of exotic neutron rich nuclei,
              specifically the neutron `halo' nuclei helium 6 and helium 8.  The availability
              of a consistent theoretical formulation of proton-nucleus scattering theory
              with the ability to perform these rigorous calculations provides a powerful
              tool to explain the properties of exotic nuclei. Motivation for this project
              comes from recent experiments at radioactive nuclear beam facilities as well as
              theoretical work recently done by a group in Surrey. The project is designed to
              be carried out during the summer of 1998.  The goal is to perform elastic
              scattering calculations on exotic helium in an intermediate energy range to
              examine the behavior of elastic scattering observables as functions of
              different spatial extensions of the neutron `halo'. This will be done following
              two different courses.  One will be to use recent realistic structure models
              from the literature. The other will be to use the description of the nucleus by
              a simpler model, namely harmonic oscillator wave-functions. This research
              requires the purchase of a state of the art visualization tool for the
              undergraduate institution. This software acquisition will also strengthen the
              college's Advanced Scientific Computing Laboratory used by all the disciplines
              in the natural arts and sciences.
