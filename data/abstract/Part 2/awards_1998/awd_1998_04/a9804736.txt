Abstract    :
              9804736  There is a serious need for effective formal methods to construct 
              correct computer programs. This need becomes crucial for reactive  systems
              associated with many safety critical or economically  vital applications, such
              as computer network communication  protocols or air traffic control systems. 
              One promising approach  centers around the use of Temporal Logic,  a logical
              formalism for describing change over time.  Purely  manual temporal reasoning
              seems infeasible for large-scale  reactive systems. The goal of this research
              is to make  verification of reactive systems as automated as possible. 
              Automated verification is more reliable than manual verification.  It is also
              more likely to be of industrial utility, as it is  possible to offer fully
              automated push-button verification and  debugging tools. The basic idea is that
              certain problems  associated with (propositional) Temporal Logic are decidable,
              in  some cases efficiently. These include the model checking problem  (Is a
              program's global state graph a model of Temporal Logic  specification ?). This
              research investigates, the following key  technical issues: (i) Amelioration of
              the state explosion problem  in model checking; (ii) Reasoning about many
              homogeneous  processes; (iii) Development of a modular Research Model Checker; 
              and (vi) Efficient program synthesis.***
