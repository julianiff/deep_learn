One of the important issues in particle physics in recent
              decades has been the question of neutrino mass.  To date, no experiment has
              clearly measured a neutrino mass that is different from zero. This proposal
              requests construction funds for an experiment that will make a definitive
              measurement in a mass region where some indication of non-zero mass has been
              seen.  In addition, this experiment includes significant education/outreach
              components.
