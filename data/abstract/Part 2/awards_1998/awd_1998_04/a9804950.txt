This two-year award supports US-France cooperative research in
              dynamic game theory and robust controller designs and its applications in
              communication networks.  It involves Tamar Basar and R. Srikant at the
              University of Illinois and Eitan Altman, Pierre Bernhard and Odile Pourtallier
              of the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied
              Mathematics (INRIA) at Sophia-Antipolis.  The investigators will address (1)
              fundamental problems in robust control, particularly with regard to nonlinear,
              piecewise-deterministic, and distributed parameter systems, and (2) the
              development and utilization of tools from robust control and dynamic game
              theory in the context of communication networks, specifically in connection
              with regulation of traffic.  

The project takes advantage of the US and
              French investigators' complementary expertise in dynamic game theory and
              control problems.  The proposal will advance our understanding of the
              applications of robust control and game theory in design of control systems
              under various types of uncertainty.
