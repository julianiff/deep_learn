Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences
              Related to the Environment for 1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity
              for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral
              degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental
              mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment
              at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem
              level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological
              Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a
              research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The
              research and  training plan for this fellowship is adaptation of bacteria  to
              acidic and alkaline environments.  This research examines  the adaptive
              responses of laboratory popultions of  Eschericia coli to changes in
              environmental pH.  The  evolution of fitness and metabolic efficiency is being 
              followed over 100 generations in acidic, alkaline, variable,  and control
              environments to address a number of specific  questions of general interest to
              evolutionary biologists and  to lay the groundwork for understanding the
              physiological  mechanisms of adaptation.
