Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to study high order numerical
methods
              for shock calculations and for computational electromagnetics.
High order
              methods can resolve complicated physical problems with a
relatively coarse
              mesh, hence reducing computational cost for such
problems.  However, high
              order methods for shock calculations and for
computational electromagnetics
              involve many theoretical and practical
issues which must be investigated.  The
              proposed work involves the
development, analysis, and applications of high
              order finite difference,
finite element and spectral methods in the
              applications areas of
computational fluid dynamics and computational
              electromagnetics.
Two emphasized aspects of the proposed effort are complex
              geometries
and efficient parallel implementations. In particular, the proposal
              contains the following components: high order methods for shock wave
              calculations, including finite difference ENO and WENO schemes, finite element
              discontinuous Galerkin methods, spectral methods, and high order methods in
              computational
electromagnetics, including spectral methods, spectral
              multidomain
methods, and absorbing layers. It is expected that the proposed
              effort will improve the state of art in high order methods for discontinuous
              problems and long time integrations, especially in complex geometry.
