We will improve the beam position and beam current
              monitoring systems in Hall A at Jefferson Lab by using a microstrip diamond
              detector. A 5 micron thick film of diamond will be covered by 0.1 micron thick
              titanium-gold electrode strips, 50 microns wide and 100 microns separated. The
              detector when placed in CEBAF`s beam will collect pairs generated by the
              electrons in the beam. By measuring the amount of charges collected by each of
              the strip electrodes the beam position be will measured to an accuracy of 5 to
              10 microns. By calculating the total amount of charge generated by the beam we
              will measure the beam's current.  In addition, using thin diamond films, we
              will build and test a prototype detector for measuring the polarization of a
              linearly polarized photon beam that uses a modified pair production method. The
              modified polarimeter will be operable at CEBAF energies and will have a factor
              of 3 improvement in analyzing power.
