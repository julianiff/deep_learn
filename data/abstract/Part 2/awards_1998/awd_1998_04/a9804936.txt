Abstract    :
              Grodzicker  9804936    The Mouse Molecular Genetics Conference will be held at
              Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, September 2-6, 1998. The meeting will bring
              together a diverse group of scientists of different professional ages who use
              the mouse to study aspects of mammalian genetics and development.    The use of
              the mouse as a model system for understanding normal developmental and genetic
              processes has increased dramatically over the last few years. This eleventh
              annual meeting will provide a format for the exchange of ideas and information
              among both junior and senior scientists.
