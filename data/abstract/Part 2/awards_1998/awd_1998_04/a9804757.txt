Abstract    :
              The primary objectives of the proposed research are:  1) Develop a new
              controller design methodology based around a combination of robust control and
              neural network reinforcement learning techniques.  The strategy will combine
              the best aspects of robust control and reinforcement learning and yield a
              combined control design that is far more powerful than either acting alone.  2)
              Provide a theoretical framework for precisely analyzing the stability and
              performance properties of reinforcement learning controllers by exploiting and
              extending results from robust control theory.  3) Apply these results to the
              design of closed loop controllers by exploiting and extending results from
              robust control theory.  4) Implement and test these ideas on an experimental
              HVAC system.  5) Educate practitioners in industry about this new technology. 
              6) Integrate these ideas into systems and control curriculum.  To accomplish
              these objectives, an interdisciplinary team has been formed consisting of a
              specialist in robust control from the Electrical Engineering Department, a
              specialist in reinforcement learning for neural networks from the Department of
              Computer Science, and a specialist in design, modeling and control of HVAC
              systems from the Mechanical Engineering Department.  This interdisciplinary
              approach will advance the state-of-the-art in the theory of robust
              reinforcement learning control design, demonstrate these new methods on an
              experimental HVAC system and provide much needed improved methods for
              controlling HVAC systems in buildings.  Eventual wide spread implementation of
              these schemes in buildings around the world will reduce energy consumption and
              extend equipment life.
