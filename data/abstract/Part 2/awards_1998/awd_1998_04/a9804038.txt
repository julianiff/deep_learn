A goal of modern physics is to understand and characterize
              the forces that are at work in nature.  A missing element of this program is
              the determination of the weak interaction strength between the neutrons and
              protons in an atomic nucleus.  The signature of the weak interaction is the
              violation of parity (left-right) symmetry.  We propose to send a beam of
              polarized neutrons from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
              reactor through a one meter long target of liquid helium.  The weak force
              between the neutrons in the beam and the helium nuclei (alpha particles) will
              cause the beam polarization to rotate about the beam direction in a right or
              left handed screw sense, by approximately one millionth of a degree.  We
              propose to measure this minute "parity nonconserving rotation of the neutron
              spin" to extract the sign and strength of the weak force between neutrons and
              helium nuclei.  Our result will be compared to the results from similar
              experiments with proton beams to provide a more complete characterization of
              the weak nuclear force.
