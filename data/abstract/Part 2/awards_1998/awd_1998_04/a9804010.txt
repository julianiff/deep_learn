Abstract    :
              9804010  Project LEAP investigates the use of lightweight, empirical, 
              anti-measurement dysfunction, and portable approaches to  software developer
              improvement. A lightweight method involves a  minimum of process constraints,
              is relatively easy to learn, is  amenable to integration with existing methods
              and tools, and  requires only minimal management investment and commitment. An 
              empirical method supports measurements that can lead to  improvements in the
              software developers skill. Measurement  dysfunction refers to the possibility
              of measurements being used  against the programmer, so the method must take
              care to collect  and manipulate measurements in a ``safe'' manner. A portable 
              method is one that can be applied by the developer across  projects,
              organizations, and companies during her career.  Project LEAP evaluates the
              strengths and weaknesses of this  approach by creating a LEAP-compliant toolset
              and method for  process data entry and analysis. The toolset and method will 
              be experimentally evaluated at a number of industry sites,  and used to explore
              the effects of the toolkit on the quality of  empirical data collected by the
              Personal Software Process. Web-  based materials for distance-based education
              on empirical  software engineering will be deployed using the toolset.***
