Abstract    :
              The 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be held at MIT
              in Cambridge, MA on August 16-21, 1998.  This Symposium is of particular
              interest since it marks the 50th anniversary of the Information Theory field.
              Because of this there will be a focus both on historical development and on
              future directions.     Papers presented will address new results in the
              following areas: coded modulation, coding theory and practice, communication
              complexity, communication systems, cryptology, data compression, data networks,
              detection and estimation, history of information theory, multiuser detection,
              multiuser information theory, pattern recognition and learning, quantum
              information processing, Shannon theory, signal processing, and source coding.  
               This symposium is a premiere meeting in the field of Information theory. 
              Travel through this grant will provide travel support for U.S. participants,
              particularly graduate students and new faculty whose papers have been selected
              for presentation at the symposium, but who lack the travel funds to the
              conference site.
