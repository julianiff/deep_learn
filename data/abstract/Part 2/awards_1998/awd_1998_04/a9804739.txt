Abstract    :
              9804739  Kurtz   The problems facing molecular biologists in understanding and
              analyzing the flood   of molecular genetic sequences and structures resulting
              from the Genome Projects raise a   range of challenging biomathematical
              research questions. The Newton Institute will host a   program on "Biomolecular
              Function and Evolution in the Context of the Genome   Project." This
              inter-disciplinary program, on the function, structure and evolution of  
              molecular sequences, will bring mathematicians and computer scientists working
              on   subjects such as probabilistic modeling, stochastic processes, geometry,
              statistical data   analysis, computational complexity, neural networks, genetic
              algorithms and expert   systems, together with molecular biologists working in
              medical and biological fields. This   award will support participation by US
              researchers. US participants will include graduate   students and postdoctoral
              and senior researchers.
