This project addresses certain fundamental aspects,
              especially symmetries, 
of the electroweak and strong interactions that are
              reflected in meson and 
nucleon properties, structure and interactions at
              low/intermediate energies. 
This research is motivated by the fact that the
              present comprehensive 
theory--the Standard Model (SM)--is known to be
              incomplete; furthermore, the 
SM becomes unworkable for strong interactions at
              low energies.  The rare 
beta decay of the pi-meson (pion), occurring once in
              about 100 million 
ordinary pion decays, provides a theoretically clean window
              to certain 
allowed extensions of the SM.  The PIBETA experiment, mounted at
              the Paul 
Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an international collaboration
              of seven 
institutions led by the UVa group, aims to improve the present 4%
              accuracy 
of the pion beta decay rate by better than a factor of ten in a
              staged 
approach, in order to match the theoretical uncertainty and provide
              new 
constraints on physics beyond the SM.  Measurements will begin in the
              summer 
of 1998 and will continue for several years.  PIBETA is the main
              effort of 
the present research proposal.  Additional commitments of effort
              include 
work on studies of nucleon and meson structure at Stanford (SLAC
              experiment 
E155) and Jefferson Lab (CLAS and RADPHI collaborations).  Lastly,
              this 
group's work on chiral symmetry breaking in the pion-pion and
              pion-nucleon 
systems is being completed and published. (Chiral symmetry is
              the organizing 
principle in low-energy strong interactions.)  During the past
              four years 
this program has resulted in two doctoral and one master's degree
              at UVa.  
Two more UVa Ph.D. degrees are expected in the next three years,
              plus three 
more at collaborating universities stemming from the PIBETA
              project alone.  
Each year typically one to two undergraduate students are
              engaged in 
research on this project, thus gaining practical laboratory
              experience.
