Abstract    :
              The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in the fall of 1982
              under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported 3-4 regional meetings per year of
              1-2 days' duration since then.  These meetings are held at various locations
              and cover a broad spectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis on
              complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure
              and applied model theory, recursion theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis
              in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory.
               NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of the speakers and
              attendees, in particular of the graduate students who attend.
