Abstract    :
              9804826  Schnoor     Funds are being provided via an interagency transfer to co-
               sponsor a National Ocean Science Bowl (NOSB), as part of the   commemorative
              activities of the 1998 United Nations-designated   Year of the Oceans (YOTO). 
              NSF joins the Office of Naval   Research, the Oceanographer of the Navy, NASA,
              and NOAA in   sponsoring a national competition for high school students on  
              topics related to the study of the oceans.  The competition is   being managed
              through the Consortium for Ocean Research and   Education (CORE) that
              represents all the major ocean science   research institutions, and the
              National Marine Educators   Association (NMEA). The NOSB will be patterned
              after the highly   successful College Bowl program that is sponsored by DOE. 
              The   Bowl will enhance knowledge of the oceans on the part of high   school
              students, their teachers, and parents, and increase the   visibility and
              understanding of ocean science research as   sponsored by NSF.
