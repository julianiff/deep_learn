This research involves the continuation of the monitoring, by
              means of fault zone guided waves, the Landers fault zone 3-D structure and
              strengthening process after the M = 7.5 earthquake of 1992. Earlier studies of
              fault zone trapped waves from Landers aftershocks allowed the delineation of
              the Johnson Valley fault (the Landers southern rupture plane) to a depth of at
              least 10km, marked by a low velocity waveguide approximately 200 m wide where
              shear velocity is reduced by 30 to 50 percent and Q is about 30.  Repeat
              seismic surveys in 1994 and 1996 using explosive sources along the Johnson
              Valley revealed an increase in seismic velocities with time.  These
              observations indicate a strengthening of the fault zone with time that may be
              due to a closure of cracks.  This grant will support a repeat of this
              experiment in 1998 and 2000.  The goal is to further understand the earthquake
              rupture process and develop methods for predicting the segmentation of known
              faults in future earthquakes.  This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
