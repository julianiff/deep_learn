The detector ICEBall2, developed for the implementation of
              internal conversion electron spectroscopy (ICES), will be used together with
              other suitable multi-detector arrays to conduct a number of crucial experiments
              to resolve important missing links in the understanding of high spin physics. 
              The decay of superdeformed bands in some Nd isotopes and the investigation of
              the origin of recently proposed continuum electric monopole transitions are
              included among the experiments.
