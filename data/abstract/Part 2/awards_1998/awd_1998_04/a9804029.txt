The Twentieth Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at
              Northwestern University on October 23-24, 1998.  This meeting attracts 75-100
              researchers in mathematical probability theory, mostly from the universities in
              the greater midwest area but also from more distant locations.  This year the
              program will feature two lectures by Professor Ioannis Karatzas of Columbia
              University on the topic of financial models.  In addition there will be two
              other speakers of one hour each.  The format encourages informal interaction
              among the participants by means of a reception on Friday evening and long break
              periods between the talks.  NSF funds will be used primarily for travel support
              with emphasis placed on encouraging attendance by graduate students and junior
              researchers.
