Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9802944                                 Principal
              Investigator: Ulf Osterberg    Title: Optical Matched Filter Detection for
              Fiber-Optic Communication    Abstract    This proposal describes a one-year
              activity in which the PI will conduct an experimental and theorectical program
              to prove the feasibility of a novel multiplexing/demultiplexing scheme that
              combines optical signal processing with conventional electronic detection.  The
              scheme utilizes orthogonal waveforms which can overlap in both time and
              frequency so that it can be more efficiently use the available bandwidth of the
              optical fiber.  An optical pulseshaper and a matched filter are used for the
              encoding and decoding of the ultrafast wavelet. This technique, if successful,
              will have potential benefit to increase the maximum transmission capacity of
              the optical fiber over 100 Gigabit/sec.
