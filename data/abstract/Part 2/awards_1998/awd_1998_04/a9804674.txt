Abstract    :
              This proposal is a continuation request for radar and optical observations of
              the polar thermosphere and mesosphere which the PI started a few years ago. The
              research will emphasize studies of changes in thermospheric composition and
              thermodynamics at various heights between 85 km and 300 km.  The changes will
              result from various solar terrestrial interactions, such as precipitation of
              auroral particles of different average energies.   In particular the PI wants
              to study the effects of solar magnetic clouds (SMCs) and coronal mass ejections
              (CMEs) in the height range of 150 - 200 km in the polar environment.  The part
              on gravity waves and tides should be of interest to the scientific community.
              The science proposed is relevant to both the CEDAR and Space Weather Programs.
