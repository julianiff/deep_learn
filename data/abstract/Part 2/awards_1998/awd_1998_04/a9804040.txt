Abstract    :
              98-04040  Pohlman     The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop Window
              on  Catalhoyuk:  An Archaeological Work in Progress.  The project will include
              a 4,500 sq. ft. exhibit, a World Wide Web site, an exhibit cookbook for
              archaeology interactives developed for the exhibit, and a suite of related
              classroom activities.   Catalhoyuk is currently the most important
              archaeological site in Turkey and among the most significant cultural heritage
              monuments in the world.  It consists of two mounds located on either side of an
              ancient river channel.  The larger mound has Early Neolithic age occupation
              levels (9000 and 7500 years ago) and represents one of the largest known
              Neolithic settlements, holding links to the beginnings of agriculture, animal
              domestication, and the rise of urban complexity.  The smaller mound consists of
              more recent occupations (7500 to 5000 years ago).  Together they may record
              nearly 10,000 years of human occupation.  SMM has been a partner, along with
              the Turkish team, in the  Catalhoyuk Research Project since its inception in
              1993 and has the responsibility of developing public programs and for bringing
              the research findings before a worldwide audience.  Unlike a traditional
              approach where the results of archaeological research appear years after the
              excavations, this project will focus on the process of archaeology giving
              visitors the opportunity of learning about the workings of contemporary
              archaeology and the nature of scientific inquiry, along with the important
              insight into the beginning of Mediterranean civilization.  The exhibit will be
              updated annually for two years to reflect new results of ongoing fieldwork. 
              The project addresses the National Science Education Standards, particularly
              those related to science as inquiry and to the history and nature of science.
