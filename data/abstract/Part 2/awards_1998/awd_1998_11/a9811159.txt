Abstract    :
              9811159  Mahboob  The PI proposes to refine and develop a process to prepare 
              low fat hamburger patties and meatballs by subjecting the  ground beef to
              microwave radiation, draining the aqueous/fat  liquid produced, separating the
              fat and aqueous layers, and  returning the aqueous layer containing nutrients
              and flavors  to the meat product.  ***
