Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation project will examine the relationship between the
              ethnic economy and labor market outcomes of second generation Korean Americans
              in New York City. It seeks to: 1) delineate labor market patterns of the second
              generation, 2) explain the conditions behind particular job choices in the
              ethnic and mainstream labor markets, and 3) examine the impact of immigrant
              entrepreneurship on the labor market trajectories of the second generation.
              Data will be obtained from a close-ended telephone survey with approximately
              200 18-35 year old second-generation (and "1.5 generation", i.e., those born in
              Korea but arrived in the US by age 12) Korean Americans. Afterwards, 40-60
              follow-up in-depth interviews will be conducted with a select sample to carry
              out qualitative analysis regarding their understanding of their labor market
              choices. The study addresses critical questions raised by the literature on
              assimilation, immigrant incorporation, and intergenerational mobility. By
              investigating/he labor market outcomes of second generation Korean Americans,
              the study will shed light on the link between parental class backgrounds, the
              salience of a vibrant ethnic economy, and the retention of ethnicity in the
              mobility patterns of the second generation vis-a-vis the ethnic economy and the
              wider mainstream economy.
