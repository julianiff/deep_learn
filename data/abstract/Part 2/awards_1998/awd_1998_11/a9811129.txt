Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to identify factors that contribute to the ease with
              which the same information can be effectively presented by a computer system in
              either written or spoken language.  Advances in computer technology lead to the
              prospect that in the near future linguistic messages could be automatically
              converted from text to speech or from speech to text.  This project will test
              the efficacy of strategies both for converting written language to spoken
              language, using text-to-speech synthesis systems, and for converting spoken
              language into written language.  It will also assess the degree to which user
              control of spoken-language presentation can enhance understanding of
              computer-based spoken messages by providing the auditory equivalent of
              rereading and scanning ahead.  Having the same message available in either
              spoken or written language would greatly enhance access to information
              technology when reading is impossible (because of the situation or because an
              individual has vision problems or limited literacy) or when understanding
              spoken language is impossible (because a situation requires quiet or because an
              individual has hearing deficits).  The results of the project will help to
              enhance the everyday use of computer technology, especially for individuals
              with impairments of hearing or vision.
