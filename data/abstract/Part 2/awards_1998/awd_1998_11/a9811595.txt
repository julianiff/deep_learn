Abstract    :
              9811595  Webster  Description:  This award is for joint research in molecular
              biochemistry  entitled US-India Cooperative Research: Engineering of Oxygen
              Affinity  of a Unique Bacterial Hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla and Studies on Its
               Role and Implications on Cellular Physiology and Biotechnological  Processes. 
              The collaborators are PIs Webster and Stark of Illinois  University and co-PI
              Dikshit of the Institute of Microbial Technology,  Chandigarh.  They will
              perform experiments to characterize and obtain  understanding on the
              biochemical function of the "hemoglobin" of the  bacterium Vitreoscilla and
              how, when introduced into a hemoglobin-less  bacterium by genetic engineering,
              it changes the biochemical pathways of  its new host's metabolism.    Scope: 
              This research has great scientific and practical value, and will add  to
              fundamental knowledge.  The collaboration will exploit the  complementary
              expertise of the two groups of investigators: biochemistry  and physical
              chemistry of proteins on the US side and recombinant DNA  technology on the
              Indian side, with obvious benefit to both.         ***
