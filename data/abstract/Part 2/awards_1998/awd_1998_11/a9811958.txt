Abstract    :
              

Talley    Support is provided for a field study of the Okhotsk Sea. 
              Specific issues are:  The formation of shelf water under sea ice in the 
              northwestern coastal  polynya through one winter with moored T/S/P/ADCP 
              measurements of  water properties and hydrographic surveys of the northern 
              Okhotsk Sea and  East Sakhalin Current (outflow from the shelves) during both 
              deployment and  recovery cruises.   Analyses of historical data  (hydrographic,
              sea-ice records,  and meteorological data) will be done in collaboration with 
              S. Martin (OCE-  9811097), who will use satellite and NCEP information during 
              the same  period to study air-sea fluxes and ice cover in the Okhotsk  Sea. 
              This work is  also in collaboration with Japanese and Russian scientists,  with
              the work to  be performed on a Russian vessel funded by Japan.
