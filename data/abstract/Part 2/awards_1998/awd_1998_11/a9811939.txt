Abstract    :
              9811939  Lelong    The project is for a numerical study of issues concerning 
              the origin of small-scale potential vorticity and its  effects on dynamics and
              mixing processes of the oceanic  small-scale.  A series of process-oriented
              numerical  simulations will be performed.  The first study will extend  the
              ongoing research on shear-enhanced dispersion due to  vortical modes.  The
              second study will focus on the  generation of potential vorticity following
              onset of  instability of an inertia-gravity wave.  The third study  will test
              parameterizations for vortical-mode dynamics in  meso-scale models.  And the
              fourth study will investigate  the effect of background vortical modes on
              energy transfers  in an internal wave field.
