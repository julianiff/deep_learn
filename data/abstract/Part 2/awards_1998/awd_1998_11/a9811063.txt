Abstract    :
                The goal of this conference is to develop a clearer understanding of cognitive
              processes that may be unique to the human species. During the past several
              decades, researchers investigating the cognitive abilities of animals
              (especially monkeys and apes) have focused on identifying the similarities
              between humans and other species. Indeed, one widely held view is that this
              research has definitively shown that there is nothing qualitatively different
              about human cognition. Nevertheless, there is an emerging body of research
              suggesting that humans have evolved specializations in several intellectual
              spheres, including those related to (1) language, (2) self-awareness, (3)
              understanding the beliefs, desires, and other mental states of other
              individuals, and (4) understanding the abstract causal principles that govern
              the movement and interactions of inanimate objects. In humans, these abilities
              emerge within the first few years of life, and profoundly affect our ability to
              acquire and use cultural ideas, symbols, and objects, and our ability to
              function in society.  The conference will bring together researchers and
              students from a variety of different academic backgrounds with a common
              interest in human cognitive specializations.  It will provide a unique
              opportunity to assess the current state of theory and research in this field,
              and help develop an agenda for future research leading to a deeper
              understanding of the distinctively human characteristics of the human mind.
