Abstract    :
              Throughout its existence East Germany has aspired to excel in sports and
              science.  At its pinnacle it had achieved notoriety in sports and spying, but
              fell short in science.  This book will be a history of deceit--embodied by
              espionage--in the quest for scientific and technological excellence, and a
              study of the culture of technology under surveillance in East Germany.  The
              objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between science and
              espionage in order to uncover its extent, methods, sources and success for
              science.  The book will attempt to answer whether and to what extent espionage
              aided East Germany's scientific aspirations.  The approach will be mainly
              historical, though it will also draw on other approaches to Science and
              Technology Studies.  At the core will be archival research in the `Stasi`
              archive, the Party archive, and the Bundesarchiv (all in Berlin, and access has
              been arranged); plus the CIA and KGB archives.  This material will be
              supplemented with printed and secondary material to create an analytic
              narrative.  Interviews with agents and officers, viewed with appropriate
              skepticism, will add detail, depth and corroboration.
