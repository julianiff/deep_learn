Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate organic ion/molecule reactions in the gas
              phase.   Anions to be studied include diazirinyl, benzocyclobutadiene radical,
              and substituted cyclopropenyl.   Variable temperature flowing afterglow-triple
              quadrupole and Fourier transform mass spectrometers will be used for gas phase
              experiments, to be supplemented by ab initio and density functional molecular
              ortital calculations, and solution reaction studies.

With this  Renewal
              award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the ongoing
              work of Dr. Steven R. Kass at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis.   The
              research focuses on understanding the reactivities and thermodynamic properties
              of reactive organic intermediates.   The work will be of interest to chemists
              trying to understand the fundamental factors which control several types of
              reactions in gases and liquids, and will provide valuable research  training to
              both graduate and undergraduate students.
