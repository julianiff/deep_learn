Abstract    :
              Eberli

The PI will use a grid of existing seismic lines and recent ODP
              chronostratigraphic data to assess the timing and style of tectonic deformation
              and architecture of the seaways in the Bahamian Foreland.  He will map drift
              deposits and erosional features caused by currents, compare the timing with
              other Caribbean tectonic events, and with development of North Atlantic Deep
              water and climate changes of the Cenozoic.  The study will help document the
              depositional history of the Florida Current.
