Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to make feasible the extraction of answers
              to very complex queries, often called data-mining queries, from extremely large
              databases. Improvements along several lines are sought, including compilation
              of queries expressed as "flocks" of queries related by several parameters,
              extraction of relations by iterative search for patterns on the World-Wide Web,
              and extension of known techniques for finding associated data to detect
              correlations and causality in comparably large databases. The approach involves
              the exploration for new algorithms, their analysis, and their implementation in
              a series of tools for implementing user-specified queries. Anticipated
              applications include discovery of plausible relationships in scientific or
              engineering data and gathering, from large bodies of news articles or other
              text, useful knowledge, intelligence, and/or general rules.
