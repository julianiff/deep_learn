Abstract    :
                In this project, the Investigators will complete the processing, analysis,
              interpretation, and  publication of data from a long term array of current
              meter moorings that was maintained at 26.5 degrees North for the 11  year
              period 1986   1997 in the western boundary system of the Atlantic Ocean. The
              overall focus will be on the nature and variability of deep recirculation,
              current structure and transport on interannual time scales in relation to large
              scale forcing changes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
              Investigators will collaborate with NOAA scientists at the Atlantic
              Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories. Specific objectives are to:  1 .
              Determine the mean transport structure east of the Bahamas, including the
              western boundary currents and deep recirculations extending to 600 km offshore 
              2. Investigate variability on interannual time scales and its relationship to
              basinwide wind forcing and changes in high latitude convective activity related
              to the NAO,  3. Improve estimates of the meridional ocean heat transport in the
              subtropical Atlantic and its annual and interannual variability using the
              current meter data along with Florida Current and interior XBT (EXpendable
              BathyThermograph) section data, and  4. Compare the current meter results with
              high resolution general circulation models.
