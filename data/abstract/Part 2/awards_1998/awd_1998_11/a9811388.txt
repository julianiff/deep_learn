This award is for renewed support for the Natural Hazards Information
              Center at the University of Colorado.  The Center will continue to serve as a
              bridge between the hazards research and practitioner communities in the United
              States.  The Center will monitor and disseminate hazards research information
              to multiple users: administrators, practitioners, policy makers, engineers, and
              scientists of all disciplines.  The Center will publish and distribute the
              Natural Hazards Observer to over 14,000 subscribers six times a year; operate
              an electronic newsletter, Disaster Research; and disseminate information via
              the World Wide Web and traditional hard copy publications.  An annual workshop
              involving users and producers of hazards research from around the country will
              be sponsored each year.  The Center will continue to build its library data
              base. It will  also enable researchers to conduct quick response
              investigations, as well as carry out a modest in-house program of research.
