Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    HOCKEN    EEC-9811556        Manufacturing is the prime component of
              the economy for all leading nations.  Precision metrology is the ingredient
              that makes advanced manufacturing possible.  Precision metrology research is
              required to keep the United States among the leaders in productivity.  A
              planning award (EEC-9705622) has shown that an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Precision Metrology at the University of North Carolina at
              Charlotte is viable.  Twelve companies have become members of the Center.
