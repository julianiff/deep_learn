Abstract    :
              Flosadottir/Johns  The water transport through the southernmost passage between 
              the Atlantic and  the eastern Caribbean, the Grenada passage, will be 
              monitored for an initial two-  year period using an existing underwater
              commercial  communication cable.  Observations and model results suggest that
              the Grenada  passage has the  largest signal among the Caribbean passages in
              terms of its  mean transport,  seasonal cycle, and overall range of
              variability. Therefore  this is an excellent  location for monitoring the
              dynamical connectivity between  the Caribbean Sea  and the Atlantic and its
              impact on climate.
