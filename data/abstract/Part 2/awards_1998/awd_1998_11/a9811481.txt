In  this  project the PIs will construct a hydrographic atlas  of
              the  Southern Ocean, including the Antarctic Circumpolar  Current and  the 
              region to its south, using all available   hydrographic data  from the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE),  and  a carefully-screened selection of
              historical data  that  have  been quality-controlled  using the WOCE data.  A 
              separate  atlas  for this region of the globe is justified by the need for
              detail  not available  in  a global atlas alone.  A variety of data  products
              are  will be generated.  A four year effort is required,  as  the data are not
              yet all available, and will be released continuously for the next several
              years.  Two electronic versions of the atlas are  envisioned:  a CD-ROM with
              built-in browser, containing data statistics, gridded fields, contoured
              sections, etc., and a World Wide  Web  site.  Printed atlases are not
              envisioned as  part  of this project.
