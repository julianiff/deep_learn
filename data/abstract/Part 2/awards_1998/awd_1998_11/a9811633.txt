Abstract    :
              SUMMARY
This project will test the hypothesis that millenial-scale increases in
              biogenic carbonate accumulation during the Late Pleistocene off the coast of
              California resulted from changes in surface water production, rather than from
              differential preservation.  The production in turn is postulated to have
              resulted from varying coastal upwelling, with stronger winds and upwelling
              corresponding to times of drier continential climate.  A suite of ODP cores
              will be sampled at 500-year intervals over the last 500,000 years to determine
              accumulation rates of calcite, opal and organic carbon.  Two time slices of
              150,000 duration will be anlayzed for taxonomic and isotopic composition of
              planktic foraminifera to determine degree of upwelling, and for pollen to
              assess cor-occurring continental climate.
