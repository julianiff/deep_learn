Abstract    :
                  9811136   Duncan    Institution: Oregon State University  Title: Radiometric
              dating of near-ridge seamounts by the  40Ar-39Ar method    This   research 
              will  continue  development  of   40Ar-39Ar  radiometric dating methods for
              volcanic rocks from the ocean  floor,  in the age range 100,000 years and
              older.   We  will  apply  these  new  methods  specifically  to  clusters   and
               lineations of undersea volcanoes near the spreading  ridges.  Such individual
              volcanoes provide a sampling of the flow and  melting  of the mantle beneath
              ridge systems that is broader  than  the  focused, often homogenized sampling
              presented  by  the  spreading ridge axis. The 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating 
              method   is  superior  to  others  because  of  the   common  occurrence  of  K
              in ocean floor volcanic rocks,  analytical  methods  are  well-tested  and 
              described,  and  in  optimum  circumstances   measurements  can  be  made  to  
              analytical  uncertainties  of  <1%. We will address several  first-order 
              questions  about crustal accretion processes near  spreading  ridges   by 
              determining  the  age  relations  of  a   large  collection of volcano chains
              and clusters in the  Rano  Rahi  field, East Pacific Rise, collected by the
              MOAI program from  the  "superfast" spreading ridge section (15-19#161#S).  Our
               principal goals are: (1) to determine whether the near-ridge  volcanoes 
              present  predominantly  a  spatial  or   temporal  recording  of  off-ridge,
              shallow  mantle  melting,  (2)  to  define  the  width of the accretionary
              zone,  and  determine  whether   this  has  a  predominantly  2-  or 
              3-dimensional  geometry,  and (3) to assess whether localized  sources  for 
              melting that produce seamounts persist for long periods.
