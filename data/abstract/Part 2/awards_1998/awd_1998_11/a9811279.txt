              ABSTRACT

OCE-9811279


The sea surface microlayer plays an important role
              in air-sea interactions, especially in modulating the exchange of heat, mass,
              and momentum.  The intensity of the modulation depends on the elasticity of the
              microlayer film, which in turn depends upon the chemical composition of the
              film.  In this project a system will be developed for mapping the chemistry of
              the sea surface microlayer in near-real time.  A surface skimming apparatus
              will be linked to a small mass spectrometer for deployment at sea from an
              instrument platform or small boat.  The combination is expected to provide
              chemical mass spectral data about the microlayer with a resolution of of
              several minutes.  The principal investigator expects that this instrumentation
              will deliver for the first time the ability to see details of the chemical
              nature of the microlayer on a time scale relevant to the physics of the sea-air
              interface.
