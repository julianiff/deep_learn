Abstract    :
              Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for community colleges, in cooperation with
              the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), proposes to conduct a
              second round of its NSF/DUE/ATE supported, multi-component curriculum
              development and faculty enhancement project.  The objective of the project is
              to improve and strengthen the teaching of science, mathematics, engineering and
              technology (SMET) at the nation's community colleges.    As in the project's
              first round (1996-1998), it is expected that this objective will be
              accomplished through a set of activities that extend, for replication, the
              knowledge, experience and quality materials achieved by six exemplary
              NSF-supported projects, first to eighteen competitively selected colleges, and
              ultimately, to community, technical and junior colleges nationwide.   
              Activities to be conducted are:  establishment of a core group of six mentors -
              experienced SMET educators in the following areas:  GIS (Patricia Cunniff,
              Prince George's Community College), mathematics (Alan Jacobs, Scottsdale
              Community College), precision agriculture (Terry Brase, Hawkeye Community
              College), biotechnology (Kathy Frame, National Association of Biology
              Teachers), image processing, using technology in the classroom (Melanie
              Magisos, Center for Image Processing in Education), and engineering technology
              "mecomtronics" (Jack Waintraub, Middlesex Community College); national
              competition to select eighteen colleges; National Science and Technology
              Education Conferences (2) at which mentors and their selected college teams
              will develop action plans; mentoring services, including site visits,
              throughout the project; networking newsletters to report on the progress of the
              eighteen colleges; case study monograph for distribution to presidents,
              academic deans and science faculty; and a broad range of other dissemination
              activities though Phi Theta Kappa and AACC conferences and publications.
