Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to construct dexterous yet mechanically simple
              robot manipulators and parts feeders using dynamic underactuated robotic
              manipulation.  ``Dynamic'' means that the robot exploits dynamic forces to help
              control the motion of the part; ``underactuated'' indicates that the
              manipulator has fewer degrees-of-freedom than the part(s) it is to control. 
              This is a minimalist approach to robotic manipulation--it seeks the simplest
              manipulators, in terms of the number of actuators, capable of controlling the
              motion of all part freedoms.  Such manipulators will be cheap, lightweight, and
              modular.  Because the manipulator has fewer freedoms than the part, the extra
              part freedoms are described by motion relative to the manipulator--slipping,
              rolling, and free flight.  Unlike pick-and-place, the part is not firmly
              grasped by the manipulator.  The purpose of dynamic underactuated manipulation
              is to exploit impact, slipping, rolling, and free flight dynamics to achieve
              effective control of the motion of the part, replacing some mechanical
              complexity of a robot system with intelligent motion planning and control. 
              This research explores controllability, motion planning, and feedback control
              of dynamic underactuated manipulation, and applications including parts feeding
              and manipulation in space.
