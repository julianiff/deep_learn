Abstract    :
              9811976  Herbert         This SGER will support a pilot project to develop the 
              use of combined alkenone unsaturation ratios (Uk1 37) and 6  18 O in a
              surface-dwelling planktic foraminifer to resolve  sea-surface temperature from
              ice-volume of ocean water  (which varies inversely with ice volume on land) and
              is  widely used as a tracer of past changes in ocean circulation  and global
              climate. In order to assign quantitive values to  the two controls, a second
              variable is needed . Alkenone  unsaturation is believed to be controlled purely
              by ambient  temperature, with no ice-volume effect, so that combining Uk  37
              and 618 O should permit the PI to solve two simultaneous  equations to derive
              quantitative estimates of both ocean  temperature and global ice volume for
              past climate states.  These climate models to understand long-term climate 
              variability.
