Abstract    :
              This research is exploring Complexity-Adaptive Processors  (CAPs), a new
              microarchitecture within which hardware  complexity, latency, and clock speed
              tradeoffs can be made  on-the-fly at runtime. CAPs employ dynamic hardware 
              structures for the major hardware functions of the processor  and memory
              hierarchy. The organization and delay of these  structures, as well as the
              clock speed of the chip, can be  modified by the compiler, runtime system, or
              on-chip  hardware to match application characteristics. This project  is
              investigating CAP design options in order to assess the  performance potential
              of this approach. Specific tasks being  carried out include: (1) Investigating
              the dynamic hardware  requirements of a variety of applications; (2) Evaluating
               the timing aspects of CAP hardware structures, including the  tradeoff between
              varying latency and clock speed; (3)  Devising configuration scheduling
              strategies for matching  the hardware to the application; (4) Evaluating
              dynamic  clocking alternatives; (5) Using simulation coupled with  timing
              analysis to quantify the performance potential of the  CAPs approach.
