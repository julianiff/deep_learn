Abstract    :
              Support is provided to analyze data collected during the  Indian Ocean 
              Expedition of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE.  The  investigators
              were responsible for the zonal line along 20  degrees S. (I-3),  Current meter
              arrays near the western boundary currents east  of Madagascar  (ICM3), and
              portions of the Southern Ocean zonal line (S-4)  and meridional  lines I-8 and
              I-9.  The three specific areas of study will  be western boundary  current
              transport, details of the Leeuwin Current and  related flows, and deep 
              circulation in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.
