Abstract    :
                Funding for this research covers the cost of purchasing 30 minutes of
              interview time in a national survey of the Hungarian electorate to be conducted
              in the Szazadveg Policy Research Center immediately after the May 10, 1998
              Hungarian parliamentary elections.  By providing funds for this project in a
              timely manner the PIs will be able to incorporate the case of Hungary within
              the 11 nation Comparative National Elections Project, thereby adding a second
              theoretically crucial East European case to a systematic comparative study of
              the social structural, organizational and attitudinal underpinnings of
              democracy in post-authoritarian and post-totalitarian systems.  Because of the
              time at which the election occurs, this project was funded as a Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research (SGER).   The SGER mechanism allows for a sound theoretic
              and methodological investigation of important former post-authoritarian and
              post-totalitarian systems.  The Program Directors for Political Science and
              Eastern European Programs support this SGER award.
