Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to make advances in the management of
              "semistructured" data: data that may be irregular or incomplete, or whose
              structure may change rapidly or unpredictably. Semistructured data is prevalent
              today, particularly through the World-Wide-Web and when integrating information
              from heterogeneous sources. The project is developing a complete database
              management system (DBMS) for semistructured data, which enables such data to be
              stored, queried, and updated easily and efficiently. The system, called "Lore",
              includes all capabilities of a traditional DBMS, with particular research
              emphasis on the new challenges that semistructured data brings to the areas of
              object storage and clustering, indexing, cost-based query optimization, trigger
              processing, and user interaction models. The project also considers
              benchmarking and scalability issues for semistructured data, integrating
              externally obtained data with Lore data during query processing, and smoothly
              combining structured data, semistructured data, and Information Retrieval style
              text search. Because the data model used by Lore is nearly identical to XML --
              an emerging standard for data representation on the World-Wide Web -- Lore is
              well-positioned as a DBMS for storing and querying Web data more effectively
              than other research or commercial system available today. Results from the
              project will be disseminated as research papers and as a freely-available
              prototype software system.
