Abstract    :
              9811964  Danvers    The Informal Science Education Program of the National
              Science foundation will provide $320,000 in partial support of "Research in
              Learning in Museums Project."  This will be the NSF contribution to a four
              federal agency effort to collaboratively support a major research project on
              learning in museums.  As the result of an RFP developed by representatives of
              the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the
              Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), and the
              National Science Foundation (NSF), an award was made to the Learning Research
              and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh.  It was agreed by the
              four agencies that the IMLS would be the coordinating agency of this award
              since they represent all museum regardless of subject, content, or type of
              audience.
