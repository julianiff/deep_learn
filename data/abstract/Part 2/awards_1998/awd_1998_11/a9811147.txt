Abstract    :
              ROBERTS, RAITZ, and KURTZ  This doctoral dissertation study is concerned with
              the effects of political, economic, and cultural change on tourism development
              in rural Alaska.  The research examines how places are represented, the kinds
              of organizations that are developed to promote tourism, and the ways in which
              tourism and its promotion creates collective memories of people and places.  It
              focuses on the case of tourism promotion in Kotzebue, northwest Alaska, and
              asks several research questions including: `How has traditional and rural
              Alaska been represented in tourism products, performances, advertising, and
              development?`; ` How and why did key tourism and rural development
              organizations adopt a corporate form?`;  and `How do practices of shared or
              social memory (oral and written) construct and reproduce social groups and
              social identities in the context of rapid tourism development?`.   A
              combination of methods will be used including archival work, textual analysis,
              and semi-structured and unstructured interviews.  The research is at the
              intersection of rural geography, tourism studies, social memory research, and
              development theory.
