Abstract    :
              Fast hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in the energy range 1-100 eV and
              higher are produced in the earth's upper atmosphere through a variety of
              processes.  Such fast ground-state hydrogen (Hf) and oxygen (Of) atoms will be
              generated in the laboratory energy range 2-100 eV using a unique experimental
              facility at JPL.  The fast atoms will then be used to study two classes of
              atmospheric reactions with the important species N2, O2, and NO.  These
              reaction classes are (a) electron-capture and stripping, where cross-section
              and mass-charge ration measurements are made using a Penning ion trap, and (b)
              infrared (vibrational) excitation and emission, where cross sections are
              measured using an integrating sphere coupled to a Fourier-transform infrared
              spectrometer.

The work proposed herein represents a unique combination of
              facilities and capital items.  The fast-atom source generates the fast
              ground-state Hf and Of atoms by forming their respective negative ions,
              accelerating to the desired final energy, and laser-detaching the electron to
              leave a fast neutral species in its ground atomic state.  The facility was
              developed under Air Force funding, the Penning trap for use in (a) was
              developed under NASA funding, and the FTIR spectrometer to be used in (b) was
              purchased under Air Force funding.  The facility is the only one of its kind
              capable of generating the ground-state atoms and making measurements in this
              difficult 2-100 eV neutral energy range.
