This award will enable a group of  U.S. engineers
              and scientists to travel to Japan to participate in the Sixth US/Japan Workshop
              on Urban Earthquake Hazards Reduction in Kobe.  The workshop will focus on
              procedures and programs that were instituted to respond to and recover from
              recent urban earthquakes in the U.S. and Japan, including the 1994 Northridge
              and 1995 Kobe earthquakes.  Both earthquake researchers and practitioners will
              represent the U.S. at the workshop.  Papers and working group records, issued
              as proceedings, should have substantial utility for those interested in
              earthquake hazard mitigation throughout the U.S. and Japan.
