Faithful partition of genetic information during mitosis and
              meiosis is the result of an ordered series of events culminating in the
              attachment of chromosomes to the spindle via a properly functioning centromere,
              chromosome disjunction and movement of chromatids or homologs to opposite poles
              of a functional spindle. A defect in any of these processes will result in
              aberrant chromosome segregation and, ultimately, aneuploidy. A thorough
              understanding of these processes will require information from simple,
              genetically tractable systems such as budding and fission yeasts, as well as
              work on metazoans.  Progress can be facilitated by sustained communication and
              interaction among individuals studying different aspects of the process in
              different systems. 

The objectives of this conference, "Fourth International
              Workshop on Chromosome Segregation and Aneuploidy" which will be held in Porto,
              Portugal, July 1-6, 1998 are to foster the exchange of information and to bring
              together research scientists from around the world who are studying different
              aspects of chromosome structure, dynamics and segregation at the molecular,
              genetic, and cellular levels.
