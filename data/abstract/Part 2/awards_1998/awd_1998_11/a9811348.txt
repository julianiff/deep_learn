This award provides funding support for the operation of the
              Carnegie Institution of Washington's (CIW) Ion Microprobe Laboratory.  The
              laboratory will be operated by CIW as a multi-user facility open to external
              researchers as well as to CIW's own staff scientists and collaborators.  The
              newly acquired Cameca IMS-6f instrument is performing at or better than
              required specs and will make available microanalytical capabilities in the
              measurement of volatile elements, stable isotopes, and trace elements in
              natural and synthetic samples. The facility is expected to provide a wide array
              of analytical applications in the service of research in geochemistry,
              cosmochemistry, and materials science.
