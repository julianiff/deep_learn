Abstract    :
              This SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) award enables the principal
              investigators to take advantage of the imminent opportunity afforded by major
              bridge reconstruction ongoing in the vicinity of Salt Lake City for Interstate
              15.  The focus of the work is on instrumentation installation and monitoring
              during full-scale structural and geotechnical testing of an existing bridge
              bent that is scheduled to be removed in the highway reconstruction.  Cyclic
              compressive, uplift, and lateral loads will be applied to the existing bent
              pile caps and the shallow footings will support the reaction frame.  The soils
              beneath the reaction frame footings will be reinforced with granular columns. 
              The results from the tests will be compared with the results from finite
              element analysis, permitting a validation of the geotechnical and structural
              model and the behavior of the materials and structures.  This research has the
              potential to make a tremendous impact on the state-of-the-art with respect to
              the response, analysis, and design of pile and granular-column reinforced
              foundation systems subjected to cyclic compressive, uplift and lateral loads. 
              In addition, this research has the potential to make an important contribution
              to the knowledge base regarding soil-structure interaction for these same types
              of loads.  This contribution will be especially significant because little work
              has been done on soil-structure interaction analyses of full-scale structures,
              including the availability of data from full-scale testing.
