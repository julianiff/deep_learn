In this work we will build geochemical evolution
              modules that simultaneously evolve the trace element and isotopic behavior of
              proposed scenarios for mantle convection and differentiation.  These tools will
              model the geochemical evolution of a wide spectrum of elements and isotopic
              systems so that one can readily determine if a given scenario is
              self-consistent across a broad-spectrum of geochemical constraints-only then
              could a rare-gas modeller readily see that his particular model is inconsistent
              with Pb,Sr, or Os isotopic constraints on mantle evolution, or vice versa.  We
              will put these modules within a MATLAB-based graphical environment that will be
              linked to the GERM web-site for broad distribution within the geochemical
              community as both a research and teaching aid.  These tools will also be used
              by us to explore the implications of a particular family of scenarios
              ("two-stage melting") that we feel show considerable promise to reconcile
              current geochemical and geophysical constraints on the large-scale geochemical
              evolution of the crust and mantle.
