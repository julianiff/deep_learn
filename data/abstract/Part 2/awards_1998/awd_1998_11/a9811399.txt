Abstract    :
              The proposed doctoral dissertation research is a comparative-historical study of
              the relationship between banking system structure and economic growth. The
              basic theory underlying the research is that if bankers possess a shared
              institutional preference for lending to commercial borrowers, then society's
              allocation of economic resources is shifted towards investment rather than
              consumption, leading to accelerated economic development. In particular, it is
              hypothesized that the impetus for the industrial revolution in Britain and
              America can be traced to social, rather than economic, factors. The direct
              relationship between bankers' lending practices and the early industrial
              revolution will be explored through the analysis of loan agreements, business
              correspondence, and committee meeting minutes from 18th century bank archives
              in Scotland, England and New York. Preliminary results suggest that differences
              in banking system structure may account for as much as 25% of the
              cross-national variance in growth rates. Data is lacking, however, for those
              countries that do not have commercial banking systems, among which are most of
              the poorest countries in the world. To the extent that conditions in those
              countries resemble pre-industrial conditions in the now-industrialized
              countries, an understanding of how early financial systems first fostered
              development during the Industrial Revolution will shed light on the prospects
              for economic development through banking reform in poor countries today.
