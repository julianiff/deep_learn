Abstract    :
              Abstract - Bequette - 9811927  Dynamics and Control of Process Systems
              (DYCOPS-5) to be held in Corfu, Greece, is the fifth in a series of symposia on
              dynamics and control of chemical reactors, distillation columns and batch
              processes, to be sponsored by the International Federation of Automatic Control
              (IFAC).  IFAC is comprised of various national member organizations around the
              world.  The American Automatic Control Council (AACC) is the U.S.
              representative to IFAC and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers is one
              of seven societies who are members of AACC.  DYCOPS-5 is organized by the
              Technical Chamber of Greece, Athens.    The theme of DYCOPS-5 is "Technology
              Push vs. Technology Pull in the 21st Century".  DYCOPS-5 aims to bring together
              researchers and developers of new methodologies (Technology Push side) with the
              users of these techniques (Technology Pull side).  This sort of interplay is
              important in the environment of global industrial competition.    DYCOPS-5 will
              focus on the examination of new methodologies and challenging applications in
              the following areas:   o Reacting process systems   o Separation process
              systems   o Batch process systems   o Complex and industrial systems   o
              Interaction of design and control
