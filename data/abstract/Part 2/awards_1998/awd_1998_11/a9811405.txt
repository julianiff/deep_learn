Abstract    :
              This dissertation project will analyze changes in the Pacific Northwest salmon
              industry and the social conflicts and environmental risks associated with the
              rise of intensive commercial salmon aquaculture.  In scarcely two decades, the
              salmon industry has shifted from a regional enterprise based upon capture of
              wild Pacific salmon to a global industry shaped by aquacultural production of
              Atlantic salmon.  Aquaculture's ability to manipulate biophysical variables to
              propagate and grow salmon has produced high-value products with year-round
              availability and consistent commodity characteristics.  At the same time,
              intensive aquaculture has encountered objections from wild salmon producers and
              other coastal resource users.  The potential deployment of genetically
              engineering fish in salmon farming raises new questions about effects on
              ecosystems, human communities, and the public interest.  Using interviews,
              historical materials, industry data and documents, legal research, and
              examination of biological science materials, the researcher will investigate
              differences between the wild and farmed salmon sectors, trends in aquacultural
              biotechnologies, and risks associated with potential deployment of genetically
              engineered fish.
