Abstract    :
              The problem of injuries to nurses and other health care workers that are caused
              by lifting is a very serious   and longstanding one.  The objective of this
              research is to determine the fundamentals for the design and   control of
              assistive devices that are either worn or directly operated by health care
              personnel for the   purpose of augmenting human physical strength with the
              device's mechanical strength, while the wearer's   intellect acts as the
              central control system for manipulating the device. In this research work all
              common   maneuvers  needed for lift and  transfer patients will be studied
              first.  To meet the maneuverability   requirements determined in this study,
              several architectures for the device will be designed.  Then the   actuators
              will be designed and built to behave inherently like Hill's model of the human
              arm. Adaptive   control rules will be developed for this assist device which
              prevent human-induced instability in the   presence of variations in the  human
              dynamics.  The control algorithm in the device also transfers to the   nurse's
              arms, as feedback, a scaled-down value of the patient's actual weight.  The
              hypothesis is that these   devices, when used by nurses to maneuver patients,
              reduce the risk of back injuries  in the nurses.
