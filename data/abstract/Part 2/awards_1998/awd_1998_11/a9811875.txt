This proposed work concerns the development of a history of
              the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere over approximately the past two
              hundred years by measuring and interpreting the hydrogen peroxide,
              formaldehyde, and nitric acid concentrations in the snow and firn at South Pole
              station.  The primary goal is to develop a record of past atmospheric
              photochemistry, with a secondary goal of evaluating the degree of spatial or
              temporal averaging necessary to resolve statistically significant changes in
              the concentration of these species over the past 200 years.  The proposed
              approach involves year-round sampling of air and near-surface snow, summer
              sampling and analysis of snow pits and firn cores, and modeling the air-snow
              chemistry in order to interpret the observed concentrations in the firn.  South
              Pole station is ideal for this work because the extreme cold makes the
              chemistry relatively simple, the NOAA Climate Modeling and Diagnostics
              Laboratory provides a context of high quality meteorological and chemical data,
              and the year-round occupation of the station makes year-round sampling
              possible.

Intensive sampling during the austral summer will be done in two
              snow pits around the perimeter of the snow stake field (for accumulation
              observations).  Proximity to the stake field is important in order to maintain
              time control for stratigraphic and chemical horizons and markers.  

The
              modeling program will expand on the framework of physically based models of the
              air-snow exchange of hydrogen peroxide developed and tested by the principal
              investigator during earlier work at South Pole and in central Greenland.
