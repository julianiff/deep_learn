Abstract    :
              Screaton

The PIs will develop a 3-D model of the fluid and thermal flow along
              strike in the Barbados Accretionary Complex considering both thermal and
              geochemical transport. The modeling effort will be directed at understanding of
              the interrelationships between tectonic and gravitational stress, fluid flow
              and thermal and geochemical transport in actively deforming sediments. The
              application of 3-D modeling in this and other complexes will assist in the
              planning of future drilling and seafloor observatory projects and in
              development of global fluid, heat and geochemical budgets.
