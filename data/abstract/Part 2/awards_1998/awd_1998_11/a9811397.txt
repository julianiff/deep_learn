Abstract    :
               From the Malcolm Baldridge Award criteria to a multitude of books on how to
              achieve it, everyone talks about what it takes to be a quality organization.
              But why does it only happen in some places?  This research attempts to
              understand the role of manager personality in developing and maintaining an
              organizational climate that emphasizes service quality and yields customer
              satisfaction.    Past research in such diverse settings as bank branches, truck
              rental sites, and hotels, among others has demonstrated the relationship
              between service climate and customer satisfaction. In a longitudinal study
              using qualitative and quantitative data, this research will test the hypothesis
              that manager personality is a direct cause of manager behavior and a principal
              influence on service climate and customer satisfaction.  The alternative
              hypothesis that climate is a direct influence on managerial behavior is also
              tested.  The research will be conducted in 210 Allstate Insurance company
              claims offices in collaboration with Allstate Research and planning Center
              (ARPC) in Menlo Park, California.  Two major practical applications of the
              research will be (1) the identification of managerial behaviors and the service
              climate they produce and (2) specification of the personality attributes
              related to such managerial behavior.
