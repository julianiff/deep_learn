Abstract    :
              This proposal pursues an older observation that the lyophilization of certain
              enzyme catalysts in the presence of highly ionic, non-buffering salts, e.g.,
              KCl, can increase the catalytic rate in non-aqueous systems by 3-4 orders of
              magnitude. This has been demonstrated primarily on subtilisin. The specific
              aims of the original proposal are:
      To elucidate the mechanism(s) of
              enzyme activation in organic solvents with salts
To extend the concept to a
              broad range of enzymes and reactions.  To utilize the activated enzymes for
              combinatorial biocatalysis.  In the revised and funded proposal, Aim 3 has been
              dropped and a more detailed examination of the mechanism and scope of the
              phenomenon has been added.
