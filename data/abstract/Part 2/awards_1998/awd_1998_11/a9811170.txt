Abstract    :
              9811170  Crowe    This award supports the development of new instrumentation for
              in  situ laser microprobe analysis of d34S with 0.1-0.3 permil  precision and
              20-30 micron spatial resolution.  The proposed  second generation instrument
              differs from current laser  microprobe instruments in three ways.  First, a
              pulsed  ultraviolet laser rather than a continuous-wave infrared laser  will be
              used for combusting samples.  The UV laser will improve  the spatial resolution
              of combustion from the current >100 micron  scale to 20-30 micron while
              minimizing thermal alteration in  zones surrounding the combustion pit. 
              Second, samples will be  purified using a flow-through interface with oxidation
              and  reduction reactors and gas chromatography rather than via  cryogenic
              distillation.  This will provide better control of the  chemical speciation of
              combustion products and will facilitate  efficient transfer of analyte to the
              mass spectrometer.  Finally,  the mass spectrometer will be upgraded to allow
              isotope-ratio-  monitoring rather than dynamically-switched microvolume inlet 
              techniques, thereby reducing sample size requirements by two to  three orders
              of magnitude.  The mass spectrometric portion of  this project will include
              development of new algorithms to  calculate the isotopic composition of sulfur
              from the molecular  spectrum of SO2.  Upon completion, the proposed instrument
              will  be applied to projects in high-temperature geochemistry, economic 
              geology and isotope thermometry for which the spatial resolution  of the
              current laser microprobe is inadequate. Foremost among  these projects are (i)
              fundamental investigations into the  effects of metamorphism on isotope
              thermometry, and applied  studies focusing on (ii) sulfur transport in shallow
              hydrothermal  systems, (iii) coupled biogeochemical cycling of carbon and 
              sulfur and metal mineralization in salt-dome cap rock  environments, and (iv)
              the sulfur isotope geochemistry of  Australian gold deposits.  ***
