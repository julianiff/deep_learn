                                            ABSTRACT                                          
                              FROELICH / 9811199    The  PI  proposes  to continue his
              studies into  the  geochemical  cycling   of  germanium  and  silica  in  the 
              ocean,   and   the  interpretation of Ge/Si-opal records in sediment cores. 
              The  two  major  goals  of  this proposal are to:  1) use  pore  water  and 
              sediment analyses of Ge to study the diagenetic behavior  of  Ge,  and  2) 
              test  the hypothesis that Ge and Si are not fractionated  during biouptake. 
              The samples to be analyzed under this proposal  represent  a unique set of
              marine sediment, pore water,  sediment  trap  materials, which have been
              collected by the  PI  on  recent  cruises.  This proposal provides the
              opportunity to close the  Ge  balance  in the oceans, since diagenetic
              reactions in the suboxic  zone may represent a non-opal "missing Ge-sink"
              needed to balance  the  opal,  fluvial and hydrothermal Ge/Si cycle  in  the 
              ocean.  These  results will permit a better interpretation of the  marine 
              sediment  Ge/Si-opal  and  opal accumulation  records,  and  thus  provide  a
              deeper understanding of the interactions among climate  change, ocean chemistry
              and paleoproductivity.
