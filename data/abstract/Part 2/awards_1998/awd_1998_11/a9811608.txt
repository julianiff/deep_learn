Abstract    :
              9811608  Kangari    This award supports a workshop to evaluate the impact of 
              research visits under the NSF-Japan Foundation Center for  Global Partnership
              (CGP) Fellowship Program on the careers  of its participants.  The PI, Dr.
              Roozbeh Kangari, Professor  and Director, Building Construction Program,
              Georgia  Institute of Technology, was a long-term research visitor to  Japan in
              1989-90 in the Japan-U.S. Fellowship Program that  preceded the CGP Fellowship
              Program which was established in  1992.    Fourteen participants representing a
              range of ages,  subsequent research experience, duration of the CGP 
              Fellowship, science/engineering disciplines, and regional  distribution will be
              invited to participate in the workshop.  One graduate student who is
              knowledgeable about the program  also will participate and assist Dr. Kangari. 
              The workshop  will be held at the National Science Foundation in  Arlington,
              Virginia, May 7 and 8, 1998.    This workshop represents the first formal
              evaluation of the  CGP Program and should be beneficial in strengthening the 
              program in the future and in attracting a larger number of  qualified
              applicants.  Support is provided by the Japan  Foundation Center for Global
              Partnership.  ***
