Abstract    :
                   The goal of this experiment is to understand the relationship between the
              Axial volcano magma chamber, volcanism,  and crustal genesis on the surrounding
              Juan de Fuca Ridge.  This experiment will use the 20-airgun array of the R/V
              Ewing to shoot to an array of 22 ocean-bottom seismometers deployed on Axial
              volcano as part of a different experiment.
