Abstract    :
              This research is on interconnect design in submicron  technologies, with the
              goal of developing a logic synthesis  methodology which would produce highly
              regular layout  structures without large area penalty. Research issues being 
              explored include: the relationship between circuit structure  and its
              incremental restructurability; achieving a network  of given properties through
              a sequence of incremental  changes; simultaneous switching and cross-talk noise
              effects  in RC interconnects; accurate, easy to compute bounds on  crosstalk
              amplitude and duration; modeling the influence of  crosstalk on delay; design
              optimization techniques for  minimizing crosstalk effects in synthesis; and
              modeling of  low-level effects which can be corrected at the routing/wire 
              sizing and/or transistor sizing steps. The project is also  developing a
              methodology to determine crosstalk budgets  based on circuit structure, as well
              as transistor and wire  sizing tools which will consider both crosstalk and
              delay.  Techniques for buffer insertion and spacing, net reordering,  and
              Boolean level regularity are also being investigated.
