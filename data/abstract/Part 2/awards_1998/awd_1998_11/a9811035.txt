Abstract    :
              Collins  9811035  Repeated measurements will be conducted to study the effect 
              of the 1997/98 El  Nino event on the hydrography and velocity fields off 
              Central California.  The  observations will enhance the temporal coverage of
              quarterly  cruises (1/98,  5/98, 7/98 and 11/98) funded by the Naval
              Postgraduate  School and the Naval  Oceanographic Office to monthly in the
              spring and bi-monthly  in the summer.  The main objectives of the work are to
              determine whether the  observed warming  of the surface waters is due to
              onshore advection of fresh  water or poleward flow  of saltier water and
              whether the oceanographic response is  locally or remotely  forced. The
              proposed measurements would complement similar  projects  scheduled to occupy
              off-shore transects from Baja California  to Washington  State. The CalCOFI
              (California Cooperative Oceanic  Fisheries) line #67 that the  PI proposes to
              sample in the Spring/Summer of 1998 has been  extensively  sampled since 1949
              which would provide an accurate  description of the  climatology of the eastern
              boundary current system as well  as comparisons of  the oceanic response for
              the most recent El Ninos. The  processed data will be  made available on a web
              page for use by other scientists.
