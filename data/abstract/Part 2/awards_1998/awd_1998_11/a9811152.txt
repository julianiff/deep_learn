Abstract    :
              9811152  Lamb    The West Virginia Department of Education, in cooperation with
              other partners, will undertake a planning project to establish the foundations
              for Project MERIT, a multiyear, systemic and sustained teacher enhancement
              program for mathematics teacher's grade 7012 in West Virginia.  Submitted under
              the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in
              Mathematics, Grades 7-12, the planning project provides for selection of a
              35-member State Mathematics Team of leaders who will-in turn-review selected
              NSF-supported, comprehensive instructional materials for middle/high school
              mathematics in preparation for Project MERIT; and plan/deliver workshops for
              district and building administrators.  National consultants assist the State
              Team in their review of the materials, and a small team of project leaders
              visits selected model Teacher Enhancement project sites.  Cost sharing is
              estimated at 250% of the NSF award.
