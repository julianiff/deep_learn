Abstract    :
              This project is one of a set of special awards to junior investigators, of small
              amounts of money to allow them to initiative a new research agenda. This
              project will study the causes of variation in coding of text, by comparing
              different methods-coding themes or words-across different informants. Fifty
              informants will write narrative texts of a recent illness. The texts will be
              analyzed by ten coders using two different methods: marking contiguous segments
              of text for themes, and performing a content analysis of key words. Coders will
              do the two tasks in random order. The themes will be tagged in the texts and
              the structures of themes used by each coder will be analyzed. In addition the
              100 key words mentioned most frequently will be coded. A theme by word
              affiliation matrix will be constructed. All pairs of coders will be analyzed
              for similarities and differences to identify core themes and words.
              Prototypical themes and informants will be identified. Tests of intercoder
              agreement will be conducted to see how many or few are required for a consensus
              on themes of varying levels of complexity. The research will advance our
              understanding of the parameters causing variation in coding, a core task in any
              quantitative analysis of text. It will be a first step towards more extensive
              research aiming to advance the analysis of texts to a more reliable and
              scientifically sound methodology.
