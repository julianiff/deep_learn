Abstract    :
              The International Rice Genome Sequencing Initiative has been  formed to promote
              collaboration in sequencing rice genomic  DNA.  The proposed workshop will
              address the U.S. response  to this initiative.    As a member of the Graminae
              and a crop plant, a wealth of  fundamental information about important aspects
              of plant  biology can be learned from the genomic sequence of rice.  Rice is a
              model for learning about yield, hybrid vigor,  single and multigenic disease
              resistance.  Different races  of rice are adapted to a wide variety of
              environmental  situations, from tropical flooding to temperate dry land, so  it
              is a model for real life adaptive responses.  Because it  shares colinear
              genomes, rice is a key to knowledge of the  genomic organization of the other
              grasses.  Comparison of  the sequence of the dicot,  Arabidopsis thaliana, with
              that  of rice, a model monocot, will tell us what genomic  structures these two
              different groups of angiosperms have in  common and how they differ.    The
              purpose of the proposed workshop is to promote and  coordinate U.S. activities
              in rice genomic sequencing with  the International Rice Genome Sequencing
              Initiative.  Topics  to be discussed would include:  1)   Inform interested
              parties about decisions taken on    behalf of the International Initiative and
              to provide a    level playing field for all parties interested in rice   
              sequencing.  2)   Plan U.S. response.  3)   Engage and help U.S. funding
              agencies in planning their    activities.
