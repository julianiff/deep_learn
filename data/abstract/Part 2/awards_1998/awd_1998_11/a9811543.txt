Abstract    :
              This is the first phase of a research project to study Puerto Rican national and
              political identity and how these affect political behavior. The study will
              examine how Puerto Ricans conceptualize their national identity through
              exploring questions about customs, way of life, and attitudes and opinions
              about this topic.  To date most of the research conducted on Puerto Rican
              national identity has been qualitative and not representative of the Puerto
              Rican population.  The infrastructure (i. e., Island wide sampling frame) does
              not exist to support large-scale nationally representative surveys.  This
              project will develop a sampling frame that will later be used to conduct a
              national representative survey of Puerto Rican attitudes about national and
              political identity in phase two of the project.  Sampling selection procedures
              consist of three stages that include municipalities, census tracts and census
              blocks.  The sample will consist of 2,500 households with approximately 5
              households per census block.  Approximately 500 blocks throughout the Island
              will be sampled.  Other activities included in phase one are the conduct of
              focus groups with citizens living throughout the Island and the development of
              a survey instrument for phase two using information gathered in the focus
              groups.
