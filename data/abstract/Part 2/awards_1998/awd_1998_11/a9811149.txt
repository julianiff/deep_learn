In this project, the PI will study the creation and evolution of
              bubbles inside oceanic breaking waves on length scales of the order of
              millimeters to centimeters, and on millisecond time scales.  An optical imaging
              instrument, based on a successful laboratory instrument will be developed and
              deployed in the surf zone, along with an underwater video camera, a pressure
              sensor, and a hydrophone.  In the images thus created, air-water boundaries
              appear as bright lines, larger bubbles appear as bright rings, and smaller
              bubbles appear as bright dots. Patterns in individual images will give a static
              view of bubble formation, while the differences between successive images will
              give a dynamical view of these processes.
