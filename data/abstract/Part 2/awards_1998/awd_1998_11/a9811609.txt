This U.S.-Slovene research project involving Peter
              Davies of the University of Pennsylvania and Danilo Suvorov of the Josef Stefan
              Institute, University of Ljubljana, examines a set of microwave dielectric
              ceramics.  Collaborative efforts will feature a range of steps including
              preparation, crystal chemistry and structure of new powder compositions as well
              as processing and dielectric characterization of the ceramic materials. 
              Results should produce a detailed analysis of the microwave response for
              candidate oxides that include systems with pyrochlore and perovskite related
              crystal structures. The intent is to 1) improve our understanding of the
              critical chemical and structural requirements for a successful ceramic
              resonator and 2) identify new areas for microwave materials development where
              potential exists for creating novel ceramics with higher dielectric constants
              and lower dielectric losses.  If successful, such materials may have
              applicability in microwave-based communication technologies.

This materials
              research project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe
              to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
