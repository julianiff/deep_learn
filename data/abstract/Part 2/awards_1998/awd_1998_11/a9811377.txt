Abstract    :
                9811377  Swager    This Selected Grant for Exploratory Research project will
              focus  on the synthesis and investigation of liquid crystals with  unusual
              forms of chirality and shape.  The use of chiral  sidechains and molecular
              shape will be examined to create systems  that have two opposing organizational
              preferences.  This  competition will provide frustration, and it is expected
              that  these materials will produce interesting situations and give rise  to
              novel phases and properties.  In other systems, the  interactions between the
              chirality and the molecular shape may be  comparative.  Illustrations of the
              types of phases include polar  lamellar structures with NLO properties, biaxial
              nematics for  display applications, and chiral columnar phases.  The columnar 
              phases should display different degrees of chirality with the  application of
              electric fields, which may be used to produce  electro-optical modulators.  %%%
               The response of liquid crystals to electric fields is at the  heart of all
              Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs).  This work seeks to  generate new types of
              liquid crystals with extended organizations  that have a chiral or handed
              sense.  These new liquid crystal  materials will produce a rotation of plane
              polarized light that  is expected to be altered upon their interaction with an
              electric  field.  New phases introduced by competing and opposing  interactions
              are also envisioned.  These new phases as well as  the interaction of the
              materials with electric fields have the  potential to produce a new class of
              optical switching materials.  ***
