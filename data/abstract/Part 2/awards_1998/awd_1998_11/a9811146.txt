                      This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program 
                    sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of     
                the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal       
              investigator is Dr. Eva Marand at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and       
              State University. The project involves the development of       
              polymer-ceramic composites that have applications as membranes for gas       
              separations. The objective of incorporating the ceramic component is        to
              enhance the free volume of the polymer where the ceramic component        acts
              as a scaffold for the polymer chains which are forced to extend.         The
              ceramic particles are covalently linked to the polymer and are        generated
              through sol-gel reactions.                Polymer-Ceramic membranes have a
              tremendous potential in separations        technologies. The ceramic component
              can impart both structural and        transport improvements. The results of
              this work has implications in a        variety of gas separation applications.
