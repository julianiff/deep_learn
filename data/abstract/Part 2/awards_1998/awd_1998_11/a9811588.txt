This three-year award supports US-Italian collaborative
              research in the area of scaling limits relating hydrodynamic and kinetic models
              of physical phenomena between Eric Carlen and Shi Jin, Georgia Institute of
              Technology, and Ester Gabetta, Ugo Ginazza, Giovanni Naldi, and Guiseppe
              Toscani at the University of Pavia, and Lorenzo Pareschi at the University of
              Ferrara in Italy.  The research will be undertaken in both a numeric and
              analytic framework.  The investigators expect to shed new practical and
              theoretical light on the problem of relating the kinetic and hydrodynamic
              descriptions of a wide range of physical phenomena.  

The US and Italian
              investigators bring to this collaboration their expertise in smoothness
              estimates, controlled truncation of the Wild expansion, the numerical solution
              of hydrodynamic problems, and robust numerical methods for multiscale transport
              equations.
