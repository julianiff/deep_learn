Under  this  grant,  PIs will continue the  Hawaiian  Ocean 
              Time Series  (HOTS)  for an additional three years. HOTS  provides  a time 
              history  of physical and chemical properties  at  a  single location  northeast
               of the island of Oahu in  Hawaii.   Research focus  will  be  on  observing
              and understanding  climate-related processes in the North Pacific Subtropical
              gyre, and a particular emphasis in this work will be to attempt to demonstrate
              the value of  maintaining HOTS into the future in support of major
              climaterelated  programs.	Data from HOTS contributes  support  to  two Global  
              Change   programs, WOCE (World   Ocean	Circulation Experiment), and JGOFS
              (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study).
