Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will extend the conceptual framework by which
              scholars seek to understand the complex interplay between disturbance regime
              and environmental gradients in structuring vegetation patterns.  The study will
              be conducted on the barrier islands of the southeastern US Atlantic coast in
              order to assess the relative contributions of two processes in structuring dune
              vegetation:  (1) transverse environmental gradients that shape cross-island
              zonation patterns, and (2) disturbance-related patch dynamics initiated by
              mechanical actions such as those associated with overwash during coastal
              storms.  The latter are thought to interrupt the former, thereby creating the
              potential for more complex and diverse plant assemblages.  Several specific
              hypotheses will be tested on the basis of information collected during
              extensive field campaigns.  Results will inform both the ecological dynamics
              literature as well as providing valuable management information for those
              seeking to protect, restore, and develop coastal systems.
