A serious consequence of
              earthquake-induced strong ground shaking is the 
potential soil failure known
              as liquefaction. In order to arrive at a 
thorough understanding of this
              phenomenon, and to formulate and calibrate 
analytical techniques to predict
              the occurrence of liquefaction and its 
effects, data has to be measured at
              instrumented sites where the in-place 
soil properties have been appropriately
              established, and where ground 
motions have been recorded for an earthquake
              strong enough to have 
generated significant increases in the pore-water
              pressures. Several sites 
around the world (e.g., Treasure Island in
              California) are instrumented 
with accelerometers and pore pressure
              transducers . The pore pressures 
recorded at the Wildlife liquefaction site
              in California during the 1987 
Imperial Valley earthquake, and subsequent
              investigations into the in-situ 
dynamic behavior of pore pressure
              transducers, demonstrated the need to 
develop a reliable pore pressure
              transducer design.

The goals of this research program are: (1) to refine and
              improve the 
design and construction of a piezometer recently developed at the
              
California Institute of Technology (known as the "Caltech" piezometer); (2)
              
to refine the piezometer field installation and in-situ calibration
              
methods, (3) to provide standard methods and guidelines defining the
              
minimum requirements for the design, preparation, installation, and
              
follow-up in-situ calibration and maintenance of piezometers; and (4) study
              
the correlation between pore pressures generated in a saturated granular
              
soil and the liquefaction potential.

Following successful testing, two
              prototype piezometers will be 
constructed and installed at the Treasure
              Island National Geotechnical 
Experimentation Site, close to the existing pore
              pressure transducers, to 
provide (1) additional instrumentation, and (2) a
              direct performance
comparison during future earthquake shaking of the
              "Caltech" transducer and 
the existing transducers.

This project is being
              coordinated with a complementary research program 
headed by Prof. Pedro de
              Alba at the University of New Hampshire.
