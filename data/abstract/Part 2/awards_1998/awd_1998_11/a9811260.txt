              ABSTRACT

OCE-9811260


One of the classical problems of oceanography is
              determining the pathways and velocities of the deep circulation.  Geochemical
              tracers of various types have been used to tackle this problem, but each of
              them seems to raise new questions whenever they are applied.  In this project,
              researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue
              development of a new analytical technique for measuring 230Th and 231Pa in
              small volumes of seawater and propose to apply the technique to the estimation
              of ventilation ages of deep water (i.e., a back-calculation of the time when
              the water mass in question was in contact with the atmosphere before
              downmixing).  Besides studies with Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) water,
              they will also apply the technique to samples from different water masses
              collected on an equatorial Atlantic transect in collaboration with other
              colleagues who will provide comparative chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data.  The
              combination of 230/231 with 3He/3H, an important older technique, and/or CFC
              data is expected to clarify the impact of mixing and source water isotopic
              signature on calculated ventilation ages.
