Abstract
The PI proposes to refine
              development of an in situ continuous water sampler that can be deployed in a
              variety of highly reducing and/or high temperature environments, such as those
              found in hydrothermal vent sites. The work will be accomplished in
              collaboration with Dr. Hans Jannasch at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
              Institute (MBARI), who has developed a prototye of the instrument known as the
              OsmoSampler.  The OsmoSampler uses the osmotic pressure that is created across
              a semi-permeable membrane by solutions of differing salinity to draw water into
              a sample tube. The current instrument has experienced problems when used in
              hydrothermal environments with preservation of samples and biofouling.  The
              PI's plan to test various types of inlet systems and acidification schemes in
              prototypes that will be deployed at several vent sites for extended periods of
              time. Deployments and retrievals will be piggybacked on existing programs and
              will not require NSF-funded shiptime.
