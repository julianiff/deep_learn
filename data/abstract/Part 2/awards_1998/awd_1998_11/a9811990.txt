Abstract    :
              
This project will combine field measurements and numerical modeling to address
              the issue of sediment trasport on shoals associates with a cape.  The authors
              will test the hypothesis that tidally-driven flow plays an important role in
              this wave-dominated setting, and results in a significant offshore transport of
              sediments.  Field measurements will include acoustic doppler current profiler
              and moored current meters to estabish tidal and higher-frquency flows at Cape
              Lookout Shoal, NC.  Fluorescent and sand tracers and optical backscatter will
              be used to assess sediment transport, and temperature/salinity measurements
              will determine the role of estuarine waters.s  Numerical modeling will
              integrate tidal and wind-driven flows with sediment transport patterns. 
              Results of this study are relevant for a wide range of societal issues
              including coastal erosion and pollutant transport.
