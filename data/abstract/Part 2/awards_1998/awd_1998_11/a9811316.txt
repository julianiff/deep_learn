Abstract    :
              Terray  An observational study of the vertical structure of currents  and
              turbulence in the ocean mixed layer will conducted  at two off the New England
              Coast. Special emphasis will be  put on the near surface region that is
              strongly  influenced by surface waves through breaking and Langmuir 
              circulation. This project relates to the more general  question of the coupling
              between the atmosphere and the  ocean by providing a link between surface
              fluxes and the  mixed layer interior in a region that is poorly  characterized.
              The two fields experiments will be conducted  during  winter when the water
              column is approximately unstratified.  One deployment will be on the New
              England Shelf  under conditions of well-developed waves, whereas the second 
              deployment will be in a large bay and will focus on  strongly forced,
              fetch-limited waves.
