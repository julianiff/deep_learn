We will study the effects of hydrothermal alteration on the
              distribution of platinum-group elements (PGE) and U-Th-Pb in altered oceanic
              crust.  Elements from both groups are considered key evidence for important
              differentiation processes on Earth.  The time-integrated effects of
              hydrothermal alteration will be studied on rocks and minerals from DSDP/ODP
              hole 504B, because it provides the most complete cross-section through altered
              oceanic crust.  Samples will be analyzed for Re-Ru-Pd-Os (Os isotopes)-Ir-Pt,
              U-Th-Pb (Pb isotopes), Sr- isotopes, and complementary trace elements mobile
              during hydrothermal alteration (e.g., Li, K, Rb, Cs, Ba, Tl, Sb).  Combining
              isotope and trace element analyses on samples from a variety of alteration
              environments with analyses of minerals from both primary and secondary mineral
              assemblages will enable us to constrain the effects of hydrothermal alteration
              on the redistribution of PGE and U-Th-Pb
in oceanic crust.
