Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the investigation of a scheme that allows for the
              representation of 2D and 3D shapes via compact and versatile geometric models
              which can model a large class of shapes and are amenable to stable and
              efficient numerical implementations.  The models are to be capable of
              representing shapes whose topology is not known a priori.  Geometric models are
              traditionally well suited for representing global shapes but not the local
              details.  In this work, a powerful geometric shape meodeling scheme is
              investigated which allows for the representation of global shapes with local
              detail and permits model shaping via physics-based control as well as
              topological changes.  These models are a blend of geometric and physics-based
              models, and are in spirit "similar" to the now popular deformable
              superquadrics, but differ from them considerably in their expressiveness and
              numerical stability, thereby promising greater applicability.
