Abstract    :
              Abstract - Doyle - 9811053  This grant constitutes support for a workshop
              entitled "Process Measurements and   Control: Industry Needs," to be held at
              the New Orleans Sheraton, March 6-8,   1998.  A broad spectrum of approximately
              20 experts from academia, industry and   government have been invited to make
              presentations in the workshop.  An   additional 30 researchers will participate
              in the workshop's discussion and   breakout sessions.  The workshop will
              deliver a report to the National Science   Foundation (NSF), the National
              Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and   to the Council for Chemical
              Research (CCR).    This is a workshop being co-organized and co-funded by NSF
              and NIST under the   Council for Chemical Research Vision 2020 Committee's
              aegis.  The purpose is to:    1. Survey the current state of the art in
              academic research and industrial   practice in the areas of process
              measurements and process control;    2. Identify major impediments to further
              progress in the field and the adoption   of these methods by industry; and   
              3. Determine highly promising new directions for methodological development and
                application areas.
