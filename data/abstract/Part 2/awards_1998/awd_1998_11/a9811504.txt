Abstract    :
              The NOAA VENTS Program has deployed a series of hydrophone arrays in the South
              Pacific and these arrays have recorded several seismic swarms on the East
              Pacific Rise.  Seismic swarms located at 3 degrees 25 minutes north, at 9
              decrees south, and at 22 degrees south are interpreted as magmatic or volcanic.
              This project will reanalyze the t-phase seismic data dn refine the epicenter
              locations, and then collect a baseline geologic and geophysical data set to
              ground truth the seismic data.
