Abstract    :
              9811381  Bickers  Theoretical and computational research will be continued on 
              this project to study the properties of correlated electrons  in solids within
              the framework of one-body and two-body self-  consistent approximations.  Such
              approximations constitute  the natural generalization of Hartree-Fock theories
              to  systems with strong interactions and large electronic  fluctuations,
              including the cuprate high-temperature  superconductors.  The research proposed
              concentrates on (a)  the extension of the one-body self-consistent field
              approach  to models with arbitrary space-and time-dependent  interactions, and
              (b) the development of a computationally  efficient technique for solving the
              parquet problem in low-  dimensional systems.  These projects are made possible
              by  using a novel representation for two-body scattering  vertices.  %%%  This
              theoretical research project involves developing  computational techniques to
              deal with electronic systems,  such as the high temperature superconductors,
              where the  electrons interact strongly.  In cases such as these,  conventional
              theoretical and computational techniques fail  to provide accurate results.  If
              successful, the project  will have wide application.  ***
