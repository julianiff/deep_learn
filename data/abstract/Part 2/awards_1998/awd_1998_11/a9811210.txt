Abstract    :
              Bursik  Support is provide to conduct an experimental investigation  of the
              sedimentation  processes that lead to the formation of delta deposits 
              (clinoforms) at the mouth of  large rivers like the Mississippi.  Using a
              series of  complex laboratory  experiments, the dominant three-dimensional
              processes  controlling delta  sedimentation will be identified and described
              from a fluid  mechanics  perspective.  These processes will be synthesized into
              a  theoretical model to  address important unanswered questions on the
              stratigraphy  of delta deposits.
