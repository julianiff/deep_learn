Abstract    :
              The PIs will carry out a high-resolution seismic survey to image the structure
              of the southern flank of the Gorda Escarpment and the transiition between the
              Escarpment and Mendocino Ridge.  The survey will be carried out to determine
              whether there are proto-San Andrea's faults in the Vincaino Block or sutures
              between blocks and the Ridge.  The timing of the uplift of the Escarpment will
              be constrained.  This will lead to an insight into the processes that are
              responsible for the transfer of the Gorda Plate crust to the Pacific Plate and
              the understanding of the plate boundary dynamics and evolution.
