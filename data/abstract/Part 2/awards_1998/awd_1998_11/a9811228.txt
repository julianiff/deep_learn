Abstract    :
              The proposed doctoral dissertation research addresses the question of how social
              networks influence the mechanics of conversation, specifically turn-taking. The
              research methodology includes two components: (1) An observational component
              codes turn-taking in meetings of managers in a large corporation. Because
              preliminary research has identified it as important for turn-taking, also
              recorded is the identity of any person addressed by a given speaker. (2) A
              questionnaire component administers a social network questionnaire repeatedly
              at 3-month intervals. Included are sociometric questions pertaining to respect,
              attributions of influence, the age of a relationship, frequency of interaction,
              liking/affect, and mutual confiding. Data analysis entails transforming the
              conversation data into multiple 2-dimensional matrices, with each matrix
              summarizing the incidence of a particular "transition" involving that pair of
              individuals, e.g., the frequency with which ego addressed alter immediately
              following a remark by alter to some third person. A variety of methods for the
              simultaneous analysis of multiple matrices will be employed to relate these
              conversational matrices to those deriving from the questionnaire. The research
              contributes most directly to network analysis, which tends to gloss over the
              mechanics of interaction, and conversation analysis, which has long maintained
              an anti-structural stance.
