Abstract    :
                  P.I.: Sinton  Proposal  Number:   98-11276    Institution:  University  of 
              Hawaii  Title: Eruptive history of the Western Volcanic Zone,  Iceland        
              The objective of this work is to determine the eruptive  history  of  ~170 km
              of Mid-Atlantic Ridge  exposed  in  the  Western  Volcanic Zone of Iceland by
              mapping of lava  flows,  determining their eruptive volumes and other
              characteristics  including  chemical  composition.   Detailed  study  of  the 
              products  of  single eruptions will determine  the  physical  nature  of 
              eruptive vents, lava flow morphologies,  fissure  lengths,  and  eruptive
              volumes, as  well  as  the  chemical  variations  associated  with these
              features.   The  combined  data for all eruptions within the Western Volcanic
              Zone will  constitute  an  unprecedented composite  of  the  frequency, 
              volumes,  chemical variability and spatial  distribution  of  volcanic
              eruptions occurring along a significant portion  of  mid-ocean  ridge.   The
              results will be used  to  infer  the  nature,  size, and processes occurring in
              subvolcanic  magma  reservoirs for this slow spreading but high magma supply
              mid-  ocean ridge.
