Abstract    :
              9811585  Dede    A series of four EHR-related projects will be selected by the
              principal investigators and EHR's Technology Integration in Education (TIE)
              committee for presentation at two sessions of the National Educational
              Computing Conference (NECC) in Dan Diego, CA on June 23, 1998.  In addition two
              sessions will be presented by two of the Collaborative Research on Learning
              Technologies (CRLT) Centers-Center for Innovative Learning Technologies (CILT)
              and Center for the Transfer of Technology to Urban Schools.    The Annual NECC
              is an excellent venue for interconnecting NSF-sponsored researchers in
              educational technology with teacher, administrators, and higher educators
              interested in the mission of the centers and project topics.  The venue will
              advance recent initiatives by REC and EHR by providing formative feedback from
              practitioners and informing the K-16 educational technology community about
              four EHR project and the Centers and the new types of opportunities they offer.
                 The principal investigators will arrange and coordinate the sessions, serve
              as moderators for all sessions to provide an integrated flow of ideas, and
              prepare a final report that summarizes the result and lessons learned from this
              project.  The NECC '98 conference committee will specially feature the four
              sessions.  ***
