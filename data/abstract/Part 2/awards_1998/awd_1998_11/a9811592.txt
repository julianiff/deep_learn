Abstract    :
              IBN 98-11592  ROUTTENBERG      It is well established that only certain cells,
              in a restricted  set of brain structures, are specifically dedicated to the 
              function of memory formation and information storage.  Dr.  Routtenberg, while
              studying the molecular events underlying this  storage process, has discovered
              such a cell in the hippocampus.  This hippocampal structure has been known from
              clinical literature  beginning in 1953 to play a central role in memory
              formation as  its removal gives rise to a profound amnesia.  Dr. Routtenberg 
              will investigate the molecular events occurring in the genome in  these
              individual cells using intronic probes to study DNA  transcription of brain
              growth proteins during the process of  synaptic change underlying information
              storage.
