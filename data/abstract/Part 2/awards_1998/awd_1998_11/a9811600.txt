This planning visit under the U.S.-Russia Cooperative
              Science Program will be to investigate "The Role of the Family in Building
              Russian Civil Society."  The planning visit will be made in May 1998 to Dr.
              Lisa A. Cubbins and Dr. Dana Vannoy of the University of Cincinnati by Dr.
              Marina Malysheva and Dr. Natalia Rimashevskaya of the Institute for the
              Socio-Economic Studies of Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The
              object of the visit is to develop a proposal to NSF by August 1998.  That
              proposal will be for a second wave longitudinal study of Russian families
              during the process of democratization.  The proposed research will be a
              follow-up to the 1995-97 NSF-funded project, "The Effect of Democratization for
              Russian Families," and will focus on the role of the family in building the
              civil society in Russia.      

This research in sociology fulfills the
              program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia
              to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
