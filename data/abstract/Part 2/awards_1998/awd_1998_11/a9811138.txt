Abstract    :
              The two main objectives of this doctoral dissertation research proposal are as
              follows: (1) To explore the questions of why, after the early 1960s,
              highly-skilled professional and technical workers from India have been
              migrating to New York, while their low-skill counterparts have been migrating
              to London; and (2) What are the consequences of these different skill-levels of
              migrants on their relations with their homeland and with the receiving areas?
              Migrants' relationships to various organizational and interpersonal
              environments are hypothesized to affect the types and destination of migration,
              and these environments are expected to vary significantly at both the origin
              and destination of migration. The proposed research examines this through
              quantitative demographic data and semi-structured, qualitative interviews from
              a random sample of first-generation Gujaratis, one of the largest Indian
              immigrant groups in the New York metropolitan area and Greater London. This
              cross-national comparison highlights the wide variation in labor migration
              within the Asian Indian diaspora, and permits us to consider the structural
              conditions that promote those particular flows of immigrants and how they might
              change for the future.
