Abstract    :
              The increasing capacity of integrated circuits (ICs) permits  complex
              components, referred to as intellectual property or  cores, to reside as a
              system on a single IC. A key  difference from the past, where each component
              was a  distinct IC, is that now the component interfaces are  flexible and can
              thus be optimized for a particular system.  This project develops an approach
              for specifying system  behavior such that cores are sufficiently encapsulated
              but  still have optimizable interfaces. The approach addresses  modeling and
              refinement through multiple specification  levels, starting from an
              object-oriented model and ending  with a connection of components, from which
              existing  methodologies take effect. The specification approach is  being
              applied to several examples, which span a variety of  interface architectures
              with diverse performance, power  consumption, and size metrics.
