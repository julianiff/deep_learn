Abstract    :
              OCE 98-11453  Lesher  The recommended project involves funds for two researchers
              from the University of California, Davis to take part in the Danish Lithosphere
              Centre (DLC) drilling cruise to the Southeast Greenland volcanic rifted margin,
              scheduled for August 20, 1998, and for three years of follow-up petrologic
              studies on the volcanic rocks cored.  The primary drilling objectives of the
              cruise are the recovery of basement lithologies (Tertiary lavas, sediments, and
              continental basement) along the feather-edge of the seaward-dipping reflector
              sequences (SDRS)  between latitudes 63 degrees north and 66 degrees north, and
              on the Greenland-Iceland Rise at latitude 68 degrees north. Drill core from
              these sites will be used to achieve three primary research goals: 1) to more
              fully characterize the earliest magmatic products and the tectonic evolution
              associated with continental breakup; 2) to close critical gaps in our
              understanding of mantle sources along the southeast Greenland margin away from
              the axis of the ancestral Iceland mantle plume (expanding on a primary theme of
              ODP Legs 152 and 163); and 3) to unite the volcanic records for the East
              Greenland flood basalt succession, the offshore SDRS comprising the East
              Greenland-Iceland Rise, and the volcanic succession of western Iceland.  Salary
              support is being recommended for the UC Davis participants during the 40 day
              cruise and for 3 years of post-cruise science.  A post-cruise report for
              general distribution will be produced, containing a complete core description,
              site reports, and preliminary results (modeled after the ODP Initial Reports).
              Follow-up analytical work and the synthesis will be a collaborative effort
              between the PI's group at UC Davis, the DLC (funding the drill ship charter)
              and R. Duncan's group at Oregon State University (40Ar/39Ar age
              determinations), building on cooperative science programs related to ODP Legs
              152 and 163 and onshore work in the East Greenland flood basalt province.  The
              UC Davis group will conduct petrog raphic and electron microprobe studies of
              the core material, and will perform whole rock trace element analyses by
              inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Major element analyses (by XRF)
              and radiogenic isotope studies (Sr-Nd-Pb-Os) will be undertaken at the
              Copenhagen Geoscience Center.  This upcoming drilling program will be a direct
              extension of drilling investigations by ODP Legs 152 and 163, and is expected
              to contribute fundamentally to the understanding of rifted margin evolution,
              plume-lithosphere interactions, and the nature of continent-ocean transition. 
              The core recovered and associated scientific discoveries also will be highly
              germane and crucial to the preparation of future proposals for deep water
              drilling in the North Atlantic Ocean for consideration by ODP-IODP.  ***
