Abstract    :
              This dissertation research examines cultural influences on vegetation within the
              Saint Lawrence Lowland in upstate New York.  The specific focus is on the
              impacts of aboriginal populations on landscape prior to European settlement and
              their possible effects on forest dynamics within the broader framework of
              late-Holocene climate change.  Controversies surrounding the extent of Native
              American practices of woodland burning will be addressed.  Sediment cores will
              be extracted and analyzed on the basis of stratigraphy, pollen, charcoal, and
              AMS dating of organic macrofossils.  This paleocological evidence will be
              coupled with other archaeological, ethnobotanical, and paleoenvironmental data
              to reveal vegetation and disturbance histories during known periods of human
              occupation, including pre-contact, post-abandonment, and post European
              settlement periods.  Results will provide insight into human-environment
              interrelations as well as providing an empirical basis for the regional
              archaeology.
