This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
              research project on quantum gravity between Dr. Jorge Pullin, the Pennsylvania
              State University and Dr. Rodolfo Gambini, Universidad de la Republica,
              Montevideo, Uruguay.  The research will deal with nonperturbative quantization
              of general relativity using connection and loop techniques.  In particular,
              they wish to explore the definition of a Hamiltonian constraint in terms of the
              use of the loop derivative, and find physical states for the theory that would
              be annihilated by all constraints.

An important question to be addressed by
              this study is the role that the cosmological constant plays in the space of
              states of the theory.  Up to now, they have found that states with a
              cosmological constant are framing-dependent knot invariants, whereas states
              without a cosmological constant are framing-independent.  Whether this is a
              generic behavior or is confined to certain states only, will be
              investigated.

The approach of both groups to the subject is complementary. 
              The approach combines the background in general relativity and gravitational
              physics of the researchers at Penn State with the expertise of the Montevideo
              group in particle physics.
