Abstract    :
              
The primary mission of the FSU Marine Laboratory is to support and foster,
              research and training programs
in the coastal sciences.  The laboratory is
              known for providing high quality seawater for experimental work
and easy
              access to a variety of coastal habitats.  The laboratory is utilized by FSU
              faculty, staff, and students
from several campus-based departments, especially
              the Departments of Biological Sciences and Oceanography, as well as visitors
              from other universities and organizations.  The laboratory supports research,
              student training, and public outreach programs.  All of these programs involve
              the laboratory maintenance and/or manipulation of marine organisms and each
              requires seawater.  The present seawater intake system is located in shallow
              water.  Because of this location the laboratory is subject to frequent
              disruptions in service owing to damage to the pipe and intake by fisherman and
              storms.  During
extreme low tides the intake manifold lies exposed and
              resuspended sediments arising from turbulence cause damage to the pumps.  These
              problems limit service and make the system extremely costly to maintain.  This
              project will allow the relocation of intake manifold to deeper water and the
              relocation and burial of the intake lines.  Completion of this project will
              insure that the laboratory is able to continue to provide the high quality
              seawater that is needed for the many research and training activities that take
              place at the laboratory.
