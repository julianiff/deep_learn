Abstract    :
              9811533  Batiza    One  of  the primary reasons that geologists study  basaltic 
              lavas  is  their  utility as probes of  mantle  and  crustal  processes. 
              However, those very processes we wish  to  study  erase  the evidence of
              processes that are active earlier  in  the  history  of  the magmatic system. 
              One means  by  which  magmas  can be preserved is as melt inclusions and 
              chemical  zoning  in crystals formed as the system evolves.   Ideally,  each
              inclusion represents a "snapshot" of the liquid trapped  by  the growth of the
              host crystal, preserving the character  of intermediate steps in the formation
              of a suite of magmas.  The  goal  of this research is to use information from 
              melt  inclusions  from lavas sampled from areas on  and  near  the  East
              Pacific Rise characterized by different levels of magma  flux, and from lavas
              erupted from volcanic centers near  but  not  actually on the axis of the
              spreading center (off  axis  seamounts).   This information will help us to
              evaluate  the  magnitude  of the compositional heterogeneity in the  mantle 
              and  of  mantle  versus  crustal processes,  and  to  better  constrain models
              of how the mantle melts.
