Kwasik
This award is a one-year renewal of an award to Professor
              Slawomir Kwasik and a graduate student of Tulane University to support
              collaboration in mathematics research with Professor Bjorn Jahren and others of
              the Department of Mathematics of the University of Oslo, Norway.  The research
              studies the relationship between algebraic K-theory and pseudo-isotopy of
              manifolds, and applies new methods employing Waldhausen's A-theory to study
              various geometric questions concerning the topology of manifolds.  The research
              is strengthened by the experience of Dr. Kwasik in the more geometric aspects
              of pseudo-isotopy theory but relies primarily on the expertise and new approach
              developed by Professor Jahren.  There is still a great deal of interest in
              research in the above areas.  Significant progress has already been made in the
              algebraic aspects of these theories, but work is still new on the geometrical
              side.  Indeed the strongest centers pursuing this research are in Northern
              Europe, and the proposed collaboration with a Norwegian group will provide
              access to the latest research developments for Dr. Kwasik as he continues to
              strengthen the research with his Norwegian counterpart.  Dr. Kwasik and his
              collaborator have made strong progress on the original research goals, and will
              be able to complete those goals with the additional year's funding.
