Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9811172  Shaw H. Chen/U. of Rochester    Equipment funds are
              provided for a luminescence spectrometer (LS-50B, Perkin-Elmer) to support an
              NSF-funded project on glass-forming crystals.  The central theme of the
              research to be supported by the requested instrument is polarized light
              emission from ordered solid films.  Specifically, linearly and circularly
              polarized luminescence from light-emitters embedded in nonfluorescent nematic
              and chiral-nematic liquid crystalline glassy hosts will be experimentally
              characterized.  Comprehensive understanding will be furnished through
              interpretation of the observed degrees of polarized emission within the
              framework of a theory in which the adsorption, generation, and propagation of
              light in structures media are all accounted for.  In addition to new
              fundamental insight into these complex optical processes, the results are
              expected to promote technological advances in optics and optoelectronics.  At
              the present time, group of six post-doctoral and Materials Science PhD students
              plus two Chemical Engineering undergraduate students will benefit from working
              with luminescence spectrometer as part of optoelectronic materials research.
