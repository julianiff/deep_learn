Title:  Helium-carbon dioxide
              relationships in mid-ocean ridge basalts and upper mantle geodynamics

Carbon
              and water have been recycled over geologic time through subduction of oceanic
              crust plus sediments, possibly in significant quantities to the deep mantle. 
              In contrast, helium isotope systematics of oceanic rocks support the hypothesis
              of mantle plumes rising from regions deep in the Earth which are relatively
              undegassed of their primordial volatile inventory.  The extent to which major
              volatiles released during volcanism, such as carbon dioxide and water, are
              juvenile rather than recycled by plate tectonics is therefore a fundamental
              question in geochemistry.  The geodynamic cycle of helium is closely linked to
              that of carbon.  There are systematic geographic variations in 3He/4He ratio
              along the mid-ocean ridge system, but their exact cause is not always well
              understood.  In some cases they may be tied to localized upwelling of high
              3He/4He material from the deep mantle.  In other cases they may be due to
              differences in the addition of 4He from the radioactive decay of U and Th.  In
              principle, an accurate knowledge of variations in the carbon dioxide/helium
              ration cna be used to distinguish between these possibilities, but the full
              development of such an approach depends on a better definition of fine-scale
              variations in the mantle CO2/He ratio.  The purpose of this study is to
              accurately determine the 3He/4He and CO2/He rations for upper mantle regions
              beneath the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean from measurements on mid-ocean
              ridge basalts.
