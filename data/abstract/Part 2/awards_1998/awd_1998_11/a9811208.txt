Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OCE-9811208 / 9815190 / 9815179 / 9815187    The well-lit surface
              waters of the world ocean is a region of material exchange with the atmosphere
              as well as a region characterized by a myriad of chemical reactions, many of
              which are driven by sunlight. In this project, the nvestigators will quantify
              and model the diel cycling of carbonyl sulfide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen
              peroxide in the upper ocean.  All three species are generated by solar
              photolysis of colored dissolved organic matter.  High resolution determinations
              of these three species will be made at sea together with appropriate optical,
              biological, and meterological measurements.  Laboratory experiments and
              mathematical models would be used to constrain the possible mechanisms of
              interconversion and to estimate unmeasured fluxes.  The investigators expect to
              achieve an unprecedented understanding of the chemistry of these
              globally-important chemical species in the sea as well as their exchange
              between the ocean and lower atmosphere.
