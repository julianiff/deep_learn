	Cordilleran metamorphic core complexes of the western US
              manifest large-scale Cenozoic crustal extension.  Slip along the detachment
              faults documents lateral displacement, but other constraints on uplift and
              timing are required to develop realistic models of this phenomenon. 
              Thermochronologic data have provided the best quantitative constraints on the
              cooling, uplift and slip rates, however inherent in the interpretation of these
              data is the assumption that cooling of the footwall occurred via conduction in
              response to uplift.  Recent work has indicated the possibility that cooling
              occurred from advective extraction of heat from the lower plate by surface
              water flowing down the detachment.  This project is aimed at testing this new
              idea.  Results have many implications related to core complexes and rates of
              uplift.
