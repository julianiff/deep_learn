Abstract    :
              The investigators obtain new observations of magnetic structures in the solar
              atmosphere to measure velocities of their elements with higher accuracy.  Using
              a CCD camera that can acquire and save images at a higher rate, they are
              measuring and correcting for images over a 10-second sampling interval. 
              Recording data on shorter time scales allows measurement of very small motions
              of photospheric bright points, particularly the vortical motions predicted from
              3-D modeling and occasionally observed.  These motions play an important role
              in heating the chromosphere and corona, and results are tested against models
              of 3-D structure to determine their implications in understanding this
              phenomena.
