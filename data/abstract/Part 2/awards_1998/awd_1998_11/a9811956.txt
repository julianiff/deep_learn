Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the risk framing practices of experts and
              non-experts by examining the symbolic and institutional cultures in which
              actors translate perceptions of risk into formal risk-related policy. 
              Conceiving of biotechnological agriculture as a sociotechnical system, the
              project will compare the development of the process of risk assessment in an
              expert regulatory apparatus with the emerging risk perception practices of
              non-experts through three site-specific case studies.  The study seeks to
              understand how French scientists, farmers, and consumers perceive and assess
              risk, investigating the extent to which divergent framings of risk within and
              between groups reflect underlying cultural concerns.  Arguing that risk
              construction is both constrained and shaped by complex cultural processes, this
              dissertation problematizes and compares the risk framing process of experts and
              non-experts to illustrate the knowledge flows and organizational structure of
              three key institutions engaged in framing the popular debate concerning the
              regulation of genetically modified crops in France. The general approach will
              be to trace the path of one particular transgenic plant variety as it moves
              from its introduction into French regulatory apparatuses into the wider society
              as a whole.  Utilizing ethnographic methods, critical reading strategies of
              archival and current print media, and comparative analysis, the study will
              investigate the processes by which knowledge regarding risk in generated and
              flows within and between expert and non-expert institutions.  Such research
              will enable an examination into the cultural constraints that shape the French
              discussion of biotechnological risk.
