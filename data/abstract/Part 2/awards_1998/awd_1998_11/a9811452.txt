Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to provide research and technical solutions for
              major problems in the Object Database Management Group's (ODMG) Standard, the
              currently proposed industrial standard for object-oriented databases. The main
              expected contributions of this project to the ODMG Standard are in the
              underlying type systems, the model of persistence, and the constraint language.
              The approach is based on establishing a well-defined family of object models
              replacing the existing single and inadequate ODMG Object Model. The expected
              results also include some implementation models and techniques applicable to
              the technology proposed by the ODMG Standard. As the ODMG Standard contains a
              binding for the Java programming language, some results of this project will
              also be applicable to the Java technology in general. The research team will
              play an active role in transferring results of this project to the ODMG by
              making specific proposals to the future releases of the Standard. The results
              of this project are intended to contribute to proliferation of a whole
              generation of commercial object-oriented database management systems compliant
              with a well-defined Standard that reflects properly the state of the
              object-oriented research.
