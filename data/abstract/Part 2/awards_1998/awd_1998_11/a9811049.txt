Abstract    :
                Almost 80 billion dollars is spent annually on nursing home care. Long term
              care costs will continue to rise as the proportion of the U.S. population aged
              65 and older increases from 13% in 2000 to 41% by 2040. Policy makers recognize
              the need to move from a reactive regulatory model of quality assurance to a
              more proactive one.  This research seeks to understand how to improve the
              efficiency and effectiveness of long term care delivery systems through
              implementing strategic performance measurement systems and quality management
              practices. A longitudinal study conducted in partnership with two Minnesota
              long term care corporations, representing 75 nursing homes, will test the
              interrelationship between corporate level performance measurement systems and
              quality management practices at the business unit (e.g. nursing home) level. It
              will also develop and implement corporate wide performance measurement systems
              that inform decisions for targeting quality management interventions within
              their long term care facilities.  A survey for assessing quality management
              practices in nursing homes will be developed based on the structure of the 1998
              Baldrige criteria and 1995 pilot  health care criteria, as well as  informed by
              research on quality management measurement and input from national long term
              care experts. The survey will be administered to management and staff in each
              nursing home prior to implementation of the performance measurement systems and
              on two subsequent occasions.  Nursing home performance outcomes will be
              measured using data from the corporations' performance measurement systems.
              Resident and family satisfaction surveys on resident quality of life and
              perceived quality of care will augment the performance measurement systems'
              information. A typology of nursing homes will be developed from the
              constellation of quality management practices and outcomes.
