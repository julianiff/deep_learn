Abstract    :
              McCreary  A modeling study of the Tsuchiya Jets will be conducted  using a suit
              of ocean  models. The Tsuchiya Jets are eastward currents located on  either
              side of the  equator along thermal fronts at the poleward edges of  thermostad
              water, that is,  at latitudes varying from 2 to 5 degrees north and south of 
              the equator and  depths of 200 m to 500 m. The underlying hypothesis is that 
              these jets are  arrested fronts where the inflow of upper intermediate water 
              in the South pacific  and eastern boundary upwelling provide a source and sink
              of  water with different  thermal structure.
