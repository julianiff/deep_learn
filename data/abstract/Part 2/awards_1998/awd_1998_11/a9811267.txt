Spatial Models of Rocky Subtidal Communities

Subtidal
              communities on hard substrates are characterized by high diversity, intense
              competition for space, small-scale turnover, and large-scale stability. This
              research project  will develop a series of four models for subtidal
              communities, using a detailed, long-term data set from the Gulf of Maine. Model
              I is a linear Markov chain model describing the replacement of individuals
              within the community and using tools from stochastic process theory to
              characterize succession and convergence in the community and develop
              perturbation analysis to characterize the response to changes in transition
              probabilities. Model 2 is a nonlinear version of Model 1;  it includes
              density-dependence in rates of transition and will incorporate new, maximum
              likelihood-based methods for parameter estimations.  Model 3 is a stochastic
              cellular automaton, which embeds the framework of Models I and 2 in an explicit
              spatial setting. This model will be used to investigate the effects of spatial
              pattern in subtidal communities. Model 4 is also a cellular automaton, but is
              developed directly from measurements of the mechanisms (recruitment, growth,
              disturbance, and competition) that generate species transitions. This research
              will provide new methods for studying community dynamics in general, and an
              increased understanding of rocky subtidal communities.
