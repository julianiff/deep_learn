Abstract    :
              The PI has developed a methodology to group token elements in 2-D or 3-D, in the
               presence of noise and outliers.  These tokens can take form of points, edgels,
              surface elements, or any combination of these.  Each site collects all the
              votes cast at its location and encodes them.  A local, parallel routine then
              simultaneously detects junctions, curves, regions and surfaces.  The method is
              non-iterative, requires no initial guess, and the only free parameter is scale.
               This research will extend the foundation work in three directions:
              formalization, validation, and extensions.  Formalization will unify the
              different elements using tensor calculus for representation, and non-linear
              polling for  data communication, and produce integrated descriptions for
              features.  Validation will be performed via controlled experiments, with
              various inputs and known amounts of noise, and results will be compared with
              imagery and methods from other sites.  Extensions will be applied to stereo,
              motion segmentation, and shape description.
