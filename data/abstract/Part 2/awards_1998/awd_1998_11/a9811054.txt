In this work we will build geochemical evolution modules that
              simultaneously evolve the trace element and isotopic behavior of proposed
              scenarios for mantle convection and differentiation.  These tools will model
              the geochemical evolution of a wide spectrum of elements and isotopic systems
              so that one can readily determine if a given scenario is self-consistent across
              a broad-spectrum of geochemical constraints-only then could a rare-gas modeller
              readily see that his particular model is inconsistent with Pb,Sr, or Os
              isotopic constraints on mantle evolution, or vice versa.  We will put these
              modules within a MATLAB-based graphical environment that will be linked to the
              GERM web-site for broad distribution within the geochemical community as both a
              research and teaching aid.  These tools will also be used by us to explore the
              implications of a particular family of scenarios ("two-stage melting") that we
              feel show considerable promise to reconcile current geochemical and geophysical
              constraints on the large-scale geochemical evolution of the crust and mantle.
