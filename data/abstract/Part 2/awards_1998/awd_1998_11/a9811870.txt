	This award provides seventy- percent partial funding support
              for the acquisition of a Mossbauer spectrometer system to be installed and
              operated in the Department of Geology and Geography at Mount Holyoke College.
              The remaining funds necessary for the acquisition will be provided by the
              College. The Mossbauer system is to be used for research and teaching by the
              Principal Investigator at Mount Holyoke and her colleagues in the neighboring
              five-college group (Amherst College, Hampshire College, Smith College, and the
              University of Massachusetts, in addition to Mount Holyoke). Use of the
              spectrometer will be focused mainly on measuring the oxidation states of Fe in
              minerals.
