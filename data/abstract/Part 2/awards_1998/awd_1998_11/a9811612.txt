Abstract    :
                        Nontechnical Abstract  9811612  PI: Hunt, J.    A central problem in
              biology is the relationship between an  organisms genes and its development. 
              Each cell of an  organism contains the same genes and yet some develop into 
              liver cells, others into nerve cells and so on.  A similar  phenomenon at the
              whole-organism level occurs when closely  related individuals, say siblings,
              develop in different  environment conditions that lead to substantial
              differences  in the growth patterns or adult morphology, physiology and 
              behavior.  Cast development in social insects is one of the  best examples of
              this phenomenon.  By quantitatively  exploring the many differences between
              queens and workers in  the paper wasp, Polistes metricus, this research will 
              explore possible explanations for caste determination that  go beyond the
              traditional idea that caste determination  occurs through behavioral
              interactions among adults in this  and other  primitively  social species.  It
              explores the  hypothesis that most caste differences can be linked to 
              nutrition during development.    The outcomes of these studies could have an
              important impact  on ideas about how caste is determined in many social insect 
              species.  Such studies are important for understanding the  ways in which
              subtle environmental differences can  profoundly influence adult morphology,
              physiology and  behavior.
