Abstract    :
              9811262  Zhang    The project is for a laboratory study of ripples and their 
              role in dissipating wind wave and generating turbulence.  Both mechanically and
              wind generated waves will be studied,  and the objective is to measure wave
              dissipation and mixing  directly.  The aim is to attain a better understanding
              of  ocean wave and mixing processes.
