Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Jingsong Zhang will pursue molecular beam studies of
              prototypical free radicals.  This research program will be developed in three
              main areas: (1) photochemistry of small radicals such as C2H3, OH, and other
              small alkyl and alkoxy radicals, (2) benchmark radical reactions involving
              systems such as OH + CO and H + O2, and (3) energy transfer/state-resolved
              inelastic scattering in small model systems involving atomic hydrogen and
              colliding partners O2, CO2, and CO.  Velocity distributions of the hydrogen
              atom products or scattering probes will be obtained via the high resolution
              high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique.  The detailed
              state-resolved product energy and angular distributions obtained are expected
              to provide new insights into the photodissociation and reaction dynamics of
              these free radicals, and these benchmarks will in turn offer stringent tests
              for high-level theories.  

Free radicals are short-lived, highly reactive
              species that have one or more unpaired electrons.  They play dominant roles in
              much of chemistry.  The gas phase free radicals chosen for study in this
              project are of current interest and of practical importance for understanding
              atmospheric reactions and chemical combustion phenomena.
