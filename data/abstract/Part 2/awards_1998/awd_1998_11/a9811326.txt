Abstract    :
              The PI will join a funded cruise on the Tokelau-Gilbert seamount chain to
              collect magnetic data and calculate paleomagnetic poles with anomaly inversion
              technique.  He will do the inversion on 12 Hawaii-Emperor seamounts and will
              use the pole positions to calculate a Late Cretacceous-Early Tertiary apparent
              polar wander path for th Pacific plate.  He will also attempt to understand the
              nature of the Hawaii-Emperor bend, whether it is due to hot spot motion or due
              to change in plate motion.  This work will enhance the value of the
              Tokelau-Gilbert survey by providing additional clues about the timing of
              volcanism in these chains and about Pacific tectonics, long-term geomagnetic
              filed geometry and true polar wander.  Two additional days of shiptime will be
              added to the original cruise for adequate magnetic coverage of the
              seamounts.
