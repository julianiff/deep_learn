The objectives of this proposal are to derive a dispersion
              relation, conditions on numerical stability and accuracy, and an absorbing
              boundary condition for the vector path integral time-domain method (PITD) and
              to explore its stability as an electromagnetic scattering technique.  The PITD
              method is, the first full wave electromagnetic field scattering formulation
              based on the path integral and also the first complete path integral expression
              for the electromagnetic field in the time domain.

The path integral
              time-domain method could be used in the design of numerous products including,
              high frequency microwave or optical circuitry, antennas and multipath signal
              analysis for personal communications devices, low frequency well logging tools
              for geophysical exploration of natural resources, and composite materials and
              paints to absorb stray electromagnetic fields.
