Abstract    :
              Political theorists generally agree that civic participation has a significant
              effect on the size and scope of government in democratic societies, but
              disagree as to the precise effect. This dissertation research project will
              compare the number of civic associations in the largest cities in the United
              States, France, and England with their relative municipal expenditures and
              voter participation rates for two fiscal years, 1880 and 1890, examining the
              effect of changes in "associationalism" on both municipal social spending and
              voter turn-out over time. The study will examine the relevance of three
              theoretical conceptions of associationalism with respect to three different
              national contexts: (1) a Neo-Tocquevillian perspective that views associational
              activity as an alternative to government intervention; (2) a Social movements
              perspective that views associations as interest-groups mobilized to stimulate
              government action in areas germane to their specific pursuits; and (3) a Social
              capital perspective that is neutral with respect to the impact of
              associationalism on the size of government, but sees associational activity as
              a stimulus to greater political participation. The results of this research
              will shed new light on the relationship between governmental and
              extra-governmental organizations in three contrasting political systems:
              France, where freedom of associationalism was limited and municipal affairs
              managed by national administrators; Britain, where associationalism was
              connected to a long history of class-based occupational organizations and
              municipal autonomy was limited by Parliamentary oversight; and (3) the U.S.,
              where associationalism was least restrained by political and economic
              constraints and municipal autonomy was greatest.
