     This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program 
     sub-element of the Interfacial,
              Transport and Separations Program of 
     the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division. The principal 
     investigator is Dr. Andrew Zydney at the
              University of Delaware. The 
     project involves the development multilayer
              membrane structures for 
     protein separations. It is based on the
              interesting concept that 
     selectivity to protein separations can be
              enhanced by designing a 
     membrane structure with a top layer of fairly
              open pore structure and 
     a bottom layer of smaller pore structure. The
              research will examine 
     the effects of concentration polarization on
              species permeability, and 
     the extent of membrane fouling and
              cleanability. The studies will 
     demonstrate the feasibility of using
              multilayer membranes for protein 
     separations, providing the necessary
              framework for the subsequent 
     optimization of these membrane structures
              for the actual purification 
     of specific protein systems encountered in
              the production of high 
     value proteins.
