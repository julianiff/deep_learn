Abstract    :
              9811907  Lewis    College and universities nationwide lament the increasing
              difficulty of enrolling ethnically and linguistically diverse student bodies
              that reflect the population of the nation.  Proposition 209 in California, the
              Hopwood Decision in Texas, and the growing trend toward such legislation in
              other states (proposed in Michigan and Washington) have further focused the
              discussion of who is able to attend college.  With the decreasing market value
              of a high school diploma and an increasingly diverse workforce, one third of
              whom are members of minority groups (SCANS, Report, 1992), a premium must be
              placed on a college education for all ethnic groups.    For the past year, RAND
              and AVID had been collaborating on a new model of networked resources called
              AVIDnet.  They have already produced surveys, focus groups, and preliminary
              designs of systems that would use technology to provide an infrastructure of
              support for expanding AVID Programs.  This effort represents one of the first
              trials of its kind to demonstrate how rich, networked interactive media can
              directly be made to serve the needs of the public-school teaching and learning
              community at middle and senior high grade levels.    The purpose of the design,
              implementation, and evaluation proposed in this Planning Grant and in future
              larger-scale research, is to extract valuable lessons in real-time from the
              AVIDnet development experience.  Results of the research would be expected not
              only to inform future uses of AVIDnet but also to support efforts undertaken by
              others to enhance teaching and learning through effective use of these new
              media.
