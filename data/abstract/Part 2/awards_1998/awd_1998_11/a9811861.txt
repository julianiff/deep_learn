This study will examine the origin, evolution morphological
              and sedimentological characteristics of natural levees in alluvial floodplains,
              concentrating on the upper Columbia River near Golden, British Columbia, and
              the Saskatchewan River at the Cumberland Marshes, eastern Saskatchewan. 
              Despite common depictions of levees as being relatively simple features, they
              are quite complex, displaying a wide range of sizes, shapes, slopes, and
              textural attributes that likely reflect controls of channel and floodplain
              configurations, channel history, sediment load, flood character and flood
              history.  This three-part investigation will include (1) measurement and
              analysis of morphometric parameters of levees, (2) hydraulic field measurements
              and mathematical modeling of modern levee formation, and (3) sedimentological
              investigations of levee deposits, focusing on the question of what can be
              inferred about channel history and evolutionary patterns of levees from their
              deposits.  The results of this project are expected to (i) permit testing of a
              proposed conceptual model for the development and growth of natural levees
              concurrently with the evolution of channels following avulsion in river
              floodplains, (ii) provide a clearer sense of the relative importance of
              diffusive and adjective mechanisms of channel-to-floodplain sediment transfer
              during different stages of levee development, and (iii) result in a better
              understanding of levee deposits and their relative importance in successions of
              alluvial sediments.
