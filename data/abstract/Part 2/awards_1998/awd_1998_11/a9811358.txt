Abstract    :
              Griffa    Support is provided to employ the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate  Model 
              (MICOM) in a very high resolution configuration (1/12 degree  grid, 6km 
              average grid size) to address questions related to the best  use and 
              interpretation of Lagrangian drifter and float observations.  The study will 
              focus on the North Atlantic Basin where there is large  observational base. 
              This project is part of the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE). 
              Synthetic upper layer drifters and isopycnic floats would be  introduced into 
              the model and their trajectories compared with data from  comparable floats  in
              the real ocean collected during the WOCE observational  period and before.
