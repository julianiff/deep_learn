Abstract    :
              9811427  Felbeck  Deception Island is a flooded caldera in the South Shetland 
              Islands, Antarctica.  The most recent eruption was in the  1970s causing the
              formation of new islands in the caldera  and various other structures.  It
              harbors many hot springs  and fumaroles submerged in the caldera and
              intertidally.  Sulfide and methane are prominent chemicals in the  outflowing
              waters.  Bacterial densities in the caldera reach  unusually high values
              probably due to the input of reduced  chemicals as energy sources.  The
              environment around the  springs resembles that found at hydrothermal vents
              where  whole communities are based on the input of chemical energy  by the hot
              waters.  Similarities to hydrothermal vent  environments include cold waters
              surrounding the hot springs  resulting in large distances to the next warm
              water habitat  and a lack of external food sources.  The latter is due to  ice
              cover during winter at Deception Island and the large  distance to the euphotic
              zone at the vent sites.  These  parameters encourage the evolution of
              alternative ways to  support life such as the establishment of a bacterial 
              symbiosis.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research  project will focus on an
              examination of the warm springs  around Deception Island for the presence of
              marine  invertebrates with chemoautotrophic symbionts.  Maps will be  made of
              any submerged fumaroles and of warm and hot springs  in the intertidal zone. 
              If animals are found near the  fumaroles or in the hot springs, specimens will
              be  collected.  Collected specimens will be examined for the  presence of
              chemoautotrophic bacteria and other adaptations  to a hot sulfide- and
              methane-rich environment using enzyme  text experimental incubations to analyze
              metabolic pathways  and microscopic examination.
