Abstract    :
              This project involves a systematic investigation of behavioral differences
              between populations of wild orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus).  The widespread tool
              use among orangutans at Suaq Balimbing (Sumatra, Indonesia) suggests that
              orangutans have population differences in behavior similar to those found in
              chimpanzees.  Focal animal observation at three established field sites (Suaq
              Balimbing, Ketambe, and Cabang Panti) will answer the following questions:  1. 
              Is there additional evidence of cultural variation in orangutans?  2.  What are
              the minimum levels of opportunity for invention, expression and social learning
              that permit cultural behavior? The hypothesis that the opportunities for social
              learning are the critical factor in the expression of these cultural behaviors
              will be tested.  Improved understanding of the cultural capacity of the
              orangutan will provide insight into the cultural capacities of the last common
              ancestor of the great apes and the evolution of culture as a key human
              adaptation.
