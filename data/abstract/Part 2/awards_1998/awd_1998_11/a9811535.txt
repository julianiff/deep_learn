Abstract    :
              This is a cooperative effort by the U.S. scientists involved  in the collection 
              and analysis of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-13,  and CCL4)  data as
              part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment  (WOCE).  The  primary goal of
              this proposal is to make the global CFC data  set available to  the scientific
              community in a usable form.  Specific  objectives include:  Finalization and
              quality control of the data, and  installation on a readily  available web
              site; Preparation of manuscripts on ocean  processes elucidated  by the CFC
              data, with particular focus on one for each major  ocean basin,  and a
              collaborative paper on the global synthesis; and,  Continuation of  production
              of various data products integrating the CFC data  with other  WOCE data sets. 
              The CFC data sets are particularly directed  at  understanding water mass
              formation, flow pathways, time  scales and rates  of spreading, ventilation and
              subduction and mixing rates,  constraints on  biogeochemical processes, and
              model validation.
