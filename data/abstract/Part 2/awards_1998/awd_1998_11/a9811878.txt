Abstract    :
              
This research involves the study, by means of PASSCAL portable
broadband
              seismometers in Argentina and Chile, of the structure
beneath the south
              central Andes where a major change in subducting
slab geometry occurs.  The
              research will be done in conjunction
with research institutes from Chile,
              Argentina, France, and
Germany.  At approximately 33.3 degrees South, the
              subducting Nazca
slab changes from a horizontal slab geometry without any
              active
volcanism to the north, to a 30-degree dipping slab with an
              active
volcanic arc to the south.  This north-south change in slab dip is
one
              of the most dramatic bends or warps in a Wadati-Benioff zone
geometry anywhere
              globally.  At 31 degrees South, the flattened
slab extends 300 km to the east
              before resuming its descent into
the mantle.  This segment has high elevations
              and large amounts of
tectonic shortening.  Across the dipping slab segment,
              the 
elevation decreases, as does the amount of tectonic shortening.
Two
              PASSCAL transects will be deployed:  one near 30.5 degrees South 
above the
              horizontal slab segment and one at 36 degrees South above 
the dipping slab
              segment.  The seismic data will be gathered from 
natural earthquakes and
              inverted to answer questions involving the
structure of the subducting slab
              across the transition, surrounding
mantle structure, mountain building, and
              earthquake generation
processes.
