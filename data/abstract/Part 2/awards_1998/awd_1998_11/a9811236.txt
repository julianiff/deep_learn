Abstract    :
              Fryer. et. al.

The PIs will investigate the blueschist samples collected
              during earlier cruises from the Mariana Forearc.  The Mariana is the only area
              where direct samples are available from deep-seated material brought to the
              seafloor by mud volcanoes with deep faults acting as conduits for this deep
              forearc material.  Isotopic studies of the pore fluids, enclosing solid
              material and fluid/gas inclusions will reflect the source regions and enroute
              water-rock interactions.  The study will provide better constraints on
              temperature-pressure conditions of the deep forearc mantle wedge near the
              decollement and nature of the water-rock interactions in convergent
              margins.
