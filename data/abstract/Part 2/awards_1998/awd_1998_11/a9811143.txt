              9811143  Cathles     Cornell University  Title: 3D modeling of hydrothermal
              venting at fast-spreading  mid ocean ridges    The  remarkable uniformity in
              the spacing of mid-ocean ridge  vents and volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits
              (thought  to  have formed at ancient ridges) has long been recognized  but 
              remains unexplained.  Also not understood is the reason  for  the size
              distribution of deposits formed at the same time in  ~40  km  diameter massive
              sulfide "camps".  Furthermore,  in  two  well-defined cases we have studied,
              the spacing of both  vents and deposits is about 1/3 that expected from the
              depth  of   burial  of  the  sill-shaped  heat  source.    However,  numerical 
               models  we  have  constructed  show  that   this  discharge  spacing can be
              explained if it is  controlled  by  the  thickness at which the thermal
              boundary above the sill-  shaped  intrusion first becomes convectively 
              unstable.   In  this  case,  the spacing of hydrothermal vents (and  massive 
              sulfide  deposits)  provides a  direct  measure  of  crustal  permeability,  
              an  important  geological  parameter.    Our  numerical modeling also shows
              that forced convection at sill  edges  (corresponding perhaps to deval offsets
              of  mid-ocean  ridges) can be an order of magnitude stronger than the  free 
              convection which occurs over the sill interior.  This may be  the  fundamental 
              explanation for the size  distribution  so  commonly  observed  in  massive 
              sulfide  deposits.    These  phenomena  and  others will be investigated  by 
              2D  and  3D  numerical computer modeling under funding from the NSF.   It  is
              expected that the work will advance understanding of both  convection  at 
              mid-ocean ridges and the  spacing  and  size  distribution of massive sulfide
              deposits, and simultaneously  benefit both science and the exploration
              industry.
