Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will assess the causes of migration and the
              consequences of in-migration on receiving communities in the Western United
              States.  The study will combine analysis of regional trends and archival
              research to document the changes that occur as well as the
              perceptions/political positions that different groups within the community have
              toward growth change.  The theoretical framework hypothesizes that both
              economic and cultural dimensions will influence the politics of restructuring. 
              It relies heavily on the theory of local dependence and on the concept of the
              growth machine forwarded by Logan and Molotch (1987).  Various scales of
              analysis will be used, and links to emerging theories in geography and regional
              science will be made.  The results will enhance our understanding of
              contemporary patterns of change in the rural west, especially as they pertain
              to shifting employment opportunities, land-use strategies, and population
              diversity.
