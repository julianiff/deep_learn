Description:  This award supports the US-India  Cooperative 
              Research: Investigations of the  Signature of the Land-Surface  Processes in
              the  Atmospheric Boundary Layer.  The collaborators  are US PI Larry Mahrt,
              Oregon State University  (OSU) and S.S. Parasnis, Indian Institute of Tropical
              Meteorology (IITM), Pune.  The PIs  will use the Atmospheric Boundary Layer
              (ABL)  model to jointly analyze unique field data  collected by IITM in a
              semi-arid region of Northwest India.  The proposed experiments  should advance
              our understanding of the coupled  land-atmosphere system for this particular
              region, and improve upon existing numerical  models.  

Scope:  This is a new
              collaboration linking OSU with the IITM, Pune. The PI is highly regarded  in
              the field of boundary layer and surface process research.  The activity, which
              will supplement the knowledge base for the OSU ABL  model and broaden
              understanding of the exchange processes of the coupled land-atmospherie system,
              is mutually beneficial.
