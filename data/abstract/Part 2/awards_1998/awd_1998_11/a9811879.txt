Abstract    :
              Thompson proposes to conduct a 40-month investigation of high school student
              learning difficulties when they participate in new instruction mehtods for
              probabilistic and statistical reasoning.  It also investigates how teachers
              might be effectively engaged in the teaching of students how to reason
              stochastically.  The project will focus on college-bound humanities-oriented
              high school students in a sememster course on probability and statistics using
              specifically designed activities and instruction.  A second phase of the
              project will engage a group of high school teachers of Algebra I and Algebra II
              in rethinking how students learn from statistics instruction.  A 4-week
              workshop for teachers will be held in the second phase.  Data will collected by
              videotape, student interviews, teacher interviews, and from examples of
              teachers' written work.

Insights gained from the project will inform
              revisions of student and instructor materials.  Results will be disseminated to
              researchers through articles in professional journals and to practitioners
              through trade journals and regional workshops.
