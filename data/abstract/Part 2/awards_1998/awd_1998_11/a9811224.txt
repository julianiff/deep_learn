              Abstract

The PI will extend his Oligo-Miocene work on the recalibration of
              magnetic polarity time scale into the Late Cretaceous through Eocene interval. 
              He will use spreading distances measured by finite rotation technique assuming
              relatively constant spreading rates at the ridge axes for million of years
              changing quickly to other constant rates.  This assumption has been confirmed
              by the work on the last 10 million years, which has independent time scale
              calibration.  Two to four intervals of apparent constant spreading on stable
              plate pairs is to be expected, with changes at time of tectonic
              reorganizations, such as the one at 6 Ma in the Pacific.  Recalibration of the
              Paleogene geomagnetic polarity time scale is crucial to a better numerical time
              scale for the entire Cenozoic.
