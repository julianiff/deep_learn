Abstract    :
              This project will initiate long-term monitoring of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to
              characterize the seismicity of this slow-spreading ridge over a wide range of
              event sizes.  The goal is to obtain a first-order understanding of the spatial
              and temporal patterns in overall seismicity, and the partitioning between
              magmatic and tectonic events, with the long-term goal of incorporating this
              information into a model for spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Six
              autonomous underwater hydrophones will be moored within the SOFAR sound channel
              between 15 degrees and 35 degrees north on the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic
              Ridge.  The array will be deployed for two years.
