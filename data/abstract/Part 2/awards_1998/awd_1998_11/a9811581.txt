This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for 15 senior US scientists and 10 US and Latin American students to
              participate in the Second San Luis Symposium on Surfaces, Interfaces and
              Catalysis, to be held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on April 12-19, 1999. 
              Organizers are Dr. Wilfred Tysoe, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and Dr.
              Giorgio Zgrablich, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina. Topic of the
              conference will be "Chemistry and Physics in Two Dimensions:  Experimental and
              Theoretical Studies of Adsorption, Reactivity and Heterogeneous Catalysis." 
              The guiding body of the conference will be an international organizing
              committee comprising scientists in the area of surface science from the United
              States, Europe and Latin America.  The goal is to facilitate collaborations,
              interactions, and transfer of ideas between countries, with the long term goal
              of  fostering north-south scientific interactions.  The symposium will  include
              both a research part and a summer school. The summer school will allow students
              to take advantage of the presence of a number of experts in the area of surface
              science from US, Latin America and Europe.
