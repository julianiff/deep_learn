Abstract    :
                9811483  Carbotte    This project will continue anaylsis of multichannel
              seismic data collected in 1995   along two contrasting segments of the East
              Pacific Rise at 16 degrees north.  The   data set is of very high quality and
              is suited for further study.  Questions to be   addressed include:  How does
              the physical state of the magma lens vary with the   tectonic and magmatic
              segmentation of the ridge?  Are discrete magma lenses   associated with the
              segmentation of the summit caldera?  How does the layer   2A/2B transition zone
              evolve and what are the implications for the geological   significance of this
              layer and for accretion processes?
