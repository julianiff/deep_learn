Abstract    :
              9811534  Shimizu    This  is  an  exploratory work for determining  Pb  isotopic
               compositions in situ in primitive MORB melt inclusions using  a  Cameca IMS
              1270 ion microprobe.  In order to address  the  question  of  the  origin of
              the garnet signature  in  MORB,  emphasis  will  be placed on whether there is 
              a  systematic  shift  of Pb isotopic compositions on melts with geochemical 
              garnet  signatures toward the HIMU mantle  component.   Melt  inclusion  suites
               in  which  garnet  signatures  have  been  recognized  by  trace element
              patterns and by  230Th  excess  will be examined.
