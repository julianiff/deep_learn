Abstract    :
                                            ABSTRACT                         Bruland : 
              OCE-9811114      The PI proposes to examine phytoplankton Fe and Zn limitation 
              in  coastal  upwelling  areas.  It is speculated that  variations  in  fluvial
              input combined with physical differences in the width  of  the  continental
              shelf and rates of upwelling, lead to variations  in Fe and Zn concentrations
              that can influence phytoplankton, and  in  particular,  diatom growth rates. 
              The PI proposes  to  study  trace  metal cycling in the central California
              upwelling area  in  1999  and  off  Peru  in  2000, in close  collaboration 
              with  D.  Hutchins, who's research focuses more on the biological  response  to
               variations  in Fe and Zn.  The results of this proposal  will  have  broad 
              impact on our understanding of the  functioning  and  controls on primary
              production in coastal upwelling regions.  The  Fe limitation hypothesis being
              studied here, is of great interest  to  a range of marine and non-marine
              scientists due to its impact  on issues of ocean carbon cycling and climate
              regulation.
