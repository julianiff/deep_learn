Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    The principal investigator will participate in a cruise of the
              French R/V Atalante to survey two areas of the MidAtlantic Ridge near the
              Azores hotspot.  The survey will include the ridge axis and extend off axis to
              crustal ages of 10-13 million years and will collect fine-scale morphological
              and geophysical data.  Questions to be addressed include:  Is there a coherent,
              multi-segment, long-wavelength signal in crustal thickness variation associated
              with the Azores-ridge interaction?  How does the degree of intrasegment
              asymmetries depend on the excess magma supply associated with the Azores
              hotspot?  How does the episodicity of magmatic/amagmatic cycles depend on the
              excess magma supply?
