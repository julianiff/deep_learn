Abstract    :
              This award provides funding  for five years of support to participate in the
              U.S. component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US
              ITASE).   US ITASE is made up of four major research disciplines: meteorology,
              remote sensing, ice coring, and surface glaciology and geophysics.  US ITASE
              hopes to answer questions about the mass balance over West Antarctica and the
              influence of major atmospheric circulation systems and oceanic circulation on
              the moisture flux over West Antarctica.  In addition, questions about the
              controls on climate variations over seasonal, inter-annual, decadal and
              centennial scales will be addressed.  Other factors to be examined by US ITASE
              relate to the impact of anthropogenic activity on the climate and atmospheric
              chemistry of West Antarctica as well as the variations in biogeochemical
              cycling of sulfur and nitrogen compounds over the last 200 years.  This project
              will perform analyses of the glaciochemistry (i.e. major anions and cations) of
              shallow and intermediate depth ice cores collected on the US ITASE traverses. 
              The ionic composition of polar ice cores provides not only a stratigraphic tool
              for relative dating but also documents changes in chemical species source
              emissions and allows characterization of the major atmospheric circulation
              systems affecting the West Antarctic ice sheet.
