Abstract    :
                One way to study the properties of normal adult language is to focus on these
              properties in other populations in whom language is just developing or in whom
              it has broken down. This approach to the study of language depends on finding a
              common pattern across different language users that can give us insight into
              how language works as a whole. This dissertation research project will use
              three populations (young children with normally developing language, slightly
              older children with specific language impairment, and adults with nonfluent
              aphasia) to address what role prosody (e.g., the rhythm structure of words and
              sentences) plays in their speech and how mental representations of language
              affect the production of speech. Specifically, the research will examine a
              particular phenomenon common to the speech of these populations: the omission
              of initial unstressed syllables within multisyllabic words. Acoustic data will
              be used to investigate the question of whether, when children or language
              disordered populations omit these syllables, their mental representation of the
              prosody of the words remains intact, and how prosodic structure is preserved in
              their productions.
