Abstract    :
              The 1998 IEEE Infocom Conference on Computer Communications will be held  in San
              Francisco, California, from March 29 to April 2, 1998.  This  conference is the
              pre-eminent technical conference for presenting new  results in all areas of
              computer communications.  This proposal requests  funding to assist
              approximately a dozen United States-based graduate  students, post-docs and
              faculty in attending this meeting.   Participation in conferences such as
              Infocom is an extremely important  part of the graduate school experience,
              providing the opportunity to  interact with more senior researchers and be
              exposed to leading edge  work in the field.  It is also vital to the continued
              development of  post-docs and faculty, particularly those relatively new to the
              rapidly  growing field of computer communications.  The support requested in
              this  proposal will enable the participation of students, post-docs and 
              faculty who would otherwise be unable to attend Infocom'98.
