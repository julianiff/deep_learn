Abstract    :
              The foci of this research extend to total synthesis and methodology  
              development.  Specific molecular targets include the TNF-alpha antagonist  
              vinigrol, the potent insecticidal alkaloid haplophytine, the octacyclic  
              polyterpenoid octacyclononaprenol, the plant hormone precursor  
              3alpha-hydroxy-ent-kaurene and the potent steroidal contraceptive agent  
              desogestrel.  Among the topics of study in new methodology are  
              enantioselective catalytic phase transfer alkylation of enolates, design   and
              application of chiral super Lewis acids as catalysts for   enantioselective
              synthesis, new oxazaborolidine catalysts for the   enantioselective reduction
              of carbonyl groups, a new process for the   synthesis of chiral alpha-stannyl-
              and alpha-lithio-carbinols, and new   stereospecific methods for the synthesis
              of olefins by fragment coupling   and the application of theses products to the
              synthesis of complex   polycyclic structures by cation-olefin cyclization. With
              this renewal   award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
              supporting the   research of Dr. Elias J. Corey of the Department of Chemistry
              and   Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Professor Corey will focus his  
              work on the development of multistep synthetic pathways to  complex,  
              bioactive organic compounds and on the discovery of new and general   methods
              for the construction of organic molecules.
