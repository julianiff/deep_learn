Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   Program
              is part of the NSF 98-20 Nanotechnology initiative and supports   research in
              the laboratories of Dr. Joseph T. Hupp at Northwestern   University. The
              research to be performed involves the fabrication of   nanochannel membranes
              based upon facial-tricarbonyl rhenium moieties   linked by pyridine derivatives
              or pyridine functionalized porphyrins.   Specific topics to be studied include:
              ultrafiltration based upon   nanochannel size or modulated ultrafiltration
              based upon   oxidation/reduction of pyridine-alkylthiol functionalized
              cavities;   affinity membrane separation that utilizes functionalized guest
              ligands   to modify the interior of nanochannels; membrane catalytic reactors
              that   are constructed by the encapsulation of chiral metalloporphyrins in  
              nanochannels; and transport modeling of adsorption and transport through  
              nanopores.  Nanoporous molecular materials are expected to achieve very high  
              selectivity and efficiency in chemical separation processes. These new  
              materials may have applications in the pharmaceutical, specialty   chemical,
              semiconductor, and petrochemical industries.
