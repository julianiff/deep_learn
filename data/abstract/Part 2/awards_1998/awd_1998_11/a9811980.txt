Abstract    :
              A crucial challenge for global query optimization in a multidatabase system is
              that some required local information such as local cost models may not be
              available at the global level due to local autonomy. A number of techniques to
              tackle this challenge have been suggested in the literature recently. However,
              they are suitable only for a static system environment. This research project
              explores theory and methods to establish dynamic cost models for a
              multidatabase system. Previous work on a query sampling method for establishing
              cost models in a static system environment is extended to a dynamic system
              environment. The methodologies adopted in this project include a qualitative
              approach, which introduces qualitative variables into cost models, and an
              adaptive approach, which adaptively incorporates dynamic cost information
              observed from execution of user queries into cost models. All approaches are
              evaluated and compared in order to determine the most promising one to
              establish dynamic cost models for multidatabase systems. Theoretical and
              experimental studies on query optimization that takes advantage of dynamic cost
              models are also conducted. The project will provide theory, algorithms, and
              implementation techniques for the design and development of an efficient
              multidatabase system.
