Abstract    :
                9811289  Rossby    Funding is provided to design and build a light-weight,
              inexpensive sound source for ocean circulation   and other ocean research
              applications.  Tracking the paths of neutrally-buoyant floats within the ocean 
               has relied on heavy and expensive acoustical sound sources.  The new acoustic
              projector is based on   the classical resonant pipe design, but uses syntactic
              foam to shape the resonant cavity instead of steel   or aluminum.  The new
              design is intended to be less costly than existing devices and more buoyant,  
              thereby reducing deployment and mooring costs. In parallel with the acoustic
              projector design, the   necessary electronics and power pack will be designed
              and built. These will include the timing circuitry   and output amplifiers. By
              using a modular design approach, the navigation function (clock) can be  
              swapped out and replaced with an acoustic telemetry function (transponder). The
              new sound source is   intended to meet the needs of research programs requiring
              limited area coverage, including areas with   complex topography, and the
              growing need for real-time acoustic telemetry from ocean bottom  
              instrumentation.
