Abstract    :
              Investigators address the roots of mean circulations in the solar interior. 
              Using similar problems in Earth's atmosphere as an analogy, they believe
              gravity-wave/mean-flow coupling in the stable solar interior is pivotal.  While
              dynamics of coherent downwellings at the convection zone base are believed to
              control scales, energetics and distribution of gravity waves generated in the
              interior, little is understood of their efficiency as an excitation source. 
              Estimates for plume penetration vary widely, and nothing is understood of plume
              scales and stability in three dimensional rotation, shear and stratification. 
              These numerical studies include compressible, anelastic, and incompressible
              simulations focusing on plume dynamics to clarify relevant processes at the
              highest attainable Reynolds numbers.  Their analytic studies address vortex
              dynamics and instabilities accompanying plume evolutions in sheared and
              stratified flows and gravity waves excited by penetrative convection as they
              propagate to greater depths.  Insuring numerical results and their implications
              for gravity-wave excitation are not constrained by model resolution, they are
              able to further quantify gravity wave forcing of the solar interior.  Results
              will yield a far more complete understanding of plume dynamics and the scales
              and character of gravity-wave excitation in the solar interior.  In sum, they
              provide important interpretations of the convective/stratified interface of the
              Sun, the dynamics controlling the interface, and the implications for the solar
              interior.
