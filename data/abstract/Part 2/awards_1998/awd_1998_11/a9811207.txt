Abstract

The PIs will study large-scale seafloor morphology
              focusing on the poorly understood feature known as megaripples with heights of
              up to 50 cm and length between 1 and 10 m.  Quaternary bedforms have so far
              only been studied along the North Carolina coast and the study will provide an
              opportunity to greatly increase our knowledge regarding small scale morphology
              by taking part in a 3D experiment planned in the Netherlands and the U.K.  The
              Dutch scientists have built instrumentation that will be deployed on the
              beaches in Holland and England.  The PIs will mount acoustic altimeters and
              side-scan sonar on the Dutch instruments to measure small-scale morphology of
              the bedform features.
