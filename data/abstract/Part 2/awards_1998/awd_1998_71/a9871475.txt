Abstract    :
              9871475  Cladis    The purpose of this award is to provide partial support to a 
              Special Symposium of the 28th Annual Meeting of the Fine Particle  Society to
              be held in Dallas, TX, April 1-3, 1998.  The invited  scientists have recently
              been credited with several breakthroughs  in advancing our fundamental
              knowledge of, therefore awareness of  potential applications for, liquid
              crystalline polymers and  elastomers.  At the Special Symposium, they willl
              share their  knowledge and perspectives of these highly novel materials, first 
              successfully synthesized and studied in Europe, with US  scientists
              particularly interested in their biomedical  applications.  %%%  Liquid
              Crystalline polymers come in two groups, those where the  liquid crystalline
              elements are linked on a linear chain and  those where they hang as side groups
              from polymer chains.  The  first are known as main-chain liquid crystalline
              polymers and the  second as side-chain liquid crystalline polymers.  While
              there is  US based expertise on main chain liquid crystalline polymers,  there
              is far less for side-chain liquid crystalline polymers and  elastomers. 
              Awareness of the range of applications for side-  chain liquid crystalline
              polymers and elastomers was recently  dramatically broadened by theoretical
              studies showing they could  have novel applications as artificial muscles. 
              Because know-how  has been developed in Europe to prepare liquid single
              crystalline  elastomers and polymers, such important theoretical conclusions 
              can be supported by experiments and materials characterizations.  As a result,
              applications, particularly in the biomedical domain,  based on these novel
              materials is ripe for further development in  biomedical engineering.  ***
