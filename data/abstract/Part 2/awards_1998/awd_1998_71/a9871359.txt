Abstract    :
                                                     This proposal seeks funds to develop a
              free-fall system  for the observation of physical and planktonic microstincture
               in the ocean. A major problem in acquiring uncontaminated  data is the
              relative motion between the ship and the sea, in  particular, ship heave. In
              spite of several different  designs, the hydrowire linking the instrument to
              the ship  causes motion of the instrument package. This induced motion  may be
              stirring the microscale optical structures that we are  trying to measure and
              contaminating measurements of  zooplankton swimming behaviors.         The
              ideal platform for making these observations is a  fxee-falling system which
              would be uncontaminated by ship  motion. Such a system will acquire physical
              and biological  data in the undisturbed waters ahead of the instrument  package
              giving a three-dimensional view of the structures and  dynamics of plankton on
              the scale of the organisms ambits.  The information generated by this
              combination of optical and  acoustic imaging will be unique and fundamentally
              alter the  way we view the oceanic plankton.
