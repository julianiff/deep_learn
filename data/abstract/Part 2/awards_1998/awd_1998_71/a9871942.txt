Abstract    :
              9871942  Coleman  Constructing a Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the
              NTS  In order to move Nevada s university system to a world-class level  of
              competitiveness, a panel of nationally recognized experts has  recommended that
              the State of Nevada: (1) develop state centers of  excellence, based on
              scientific strength, uniqueness, fundability,  and consistency with the state s
              long-range science plan and (2)  exploit the unique opportunities of the Nevada
              Test Site (NTS). The  experts also explicitly identified Nevada s Global
              Environmental  Change Program (NevGEC) as a potential target area. The current 
              project is consistent with these recommendations and will add the  experimental
              infrastructure and remote sensing technology necessary  to integrate
              investigations of potential long-term changes of a  desert ecosystem to
              increased precipitation, increased nitrogen  deposition, and degradation of a
              microbiotic crust that lives on  the surface of desert soil to ongoing work on
              the effects of  elevated CO2 on an intact desert ecosystem at the Nevada Desert
               Face Facility (NDFF) on the NTS. This project will:  (1) help  solidify a
              scientific center of excellence in Nevada and thus  potentially have a very
              positive short-term impact on Nevada s  research competitiveness; (2) benefit
              the entire state as the  NevGEC Program is a unique collaboration between the
              three main  research institutions in Nevada; (3) address an issue of ecological
               importance to Nevada and to the world, and (4) create a world-class  research
              facility on the NTS, a site that is critical to Nevada s  long-term economic
              development.
