Abstract    :
              EIA-9871159  Nawab, S. Hamid  Castanon, David A.  Boston University    MRI: 
              Acquisition of Computer Facilities to Support an Interdisciplinary Multidata
              Signal and Imaging Processing Laboratory    The requested instrumentation will
              serve to establish a dedicated interdisciplinary signal and image processing
              facility, serving a core of eight faculty members and their students in the
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Boston University.  The
              equipment is intended to develop a unified signal and image processing
              computing facility in the department.  This facility will support student and
              faculty research projects, enabling new multi-modal signal and image processing
              projects through access to a variety of I/O devices and enhancing current and
              pending research projects by making cross-disciplinary work much easier with
              the existence of a common software environment and fast data storage and
              computing platforms.  The proposed equipment consists of, 1) a computational
              engine with significant core memory to provide the necessary tools for tracking
              the challenging computational problems; 2) a dedicated data server; 3) a number
              of satellite computers of varying computational power and type, and 4) a wide
              variety of input and output devices chosen to provide state-of-the-art capture,
              storage, manipulations, and presentation capabilities in major functional areas
              associated with signal and image processing research and education.
