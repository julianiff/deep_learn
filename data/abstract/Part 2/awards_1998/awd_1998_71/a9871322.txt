The Colorado Center for Advanced Ceramics at the Colorado
              School of Mines (CMS) will purchase a mechanical properties microprobe
              dedicated to support research, research training, and education in engineering.
               In addition to providing valuable, and in some cases, critical data for a
              large number of research programs at CSM, the equipment will foster interaction
              between research programs within several departments and institutions.  

The
              equipment is critical for several research programs, which require the
              characterization of materials on a fine scale.  A primary area of research aims
              to describe the structures/properties relationships in thin films and coatings.
               A second area is the understanding of processing and properties of ceramic
              based composites.  A third area is the fundamental characterization of the
              coatings and constituents of advanced steels.  In-situ constituent property
              characterization in composites and steels is very important if one is to model
              the overall mechanical response.
