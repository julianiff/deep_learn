              ABSTRACT     CTS-9871406  Kathleen Johnston, Steven A. Jones, James L. Maxwell 
              Louisiana Tech University    Title: The Multidisciplinary Equipment Enhancement
              Project    Louisiana Tech University will purchase research equipment to be
              shared by a multidisciplinary team headed by Prof. K. Johnston. The university
              will cost-share over 45% of the acquisition. The equipment includes a Cosmic
              Ray Test Stand with Data Acquisition, a Circuit Board Design Station, a
              Particle Image Velocimetry System, a Laser Doppler Velocimetry System, and a
              Computer-Network System. The shared instrumentation will be managed by the
              Center for Applied Physical Studies at Louisiana Tech University, for research
              in Particle Physics, Fluids Engineering, Micromanufacturing and Biomedical
              Engineering. The four groups are linked at the project level, for example in
              the Positron Emission Tomography project.
