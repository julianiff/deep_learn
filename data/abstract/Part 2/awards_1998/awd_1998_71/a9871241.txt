Abstract    :
              9871241 Kilduff ACQUISITION OF INSTRUMENTATION FOR RESEARCH ON AQUEOUS COLLOIDS
              AND PARTICLES IN NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY ENGINEERED SYSTEMS This is a
              proposal to provide support for instrumentation that will be utilized to
              support research on the role that colloids and particles in aqueous suspension
              play in transport and fate of environmental pollutants.  Studies will be
              conducted that focus on colloids and particles that affect potable water
              quality, influence the performance of water treatment processes, contribute to
              the formation of sediments and control their release of contaminants to the
              environment, and that affect the cycling of carbon and other nutrients under
              the influence of biological, chemical and geologic processes.  Specifically,
              the research will address the role of organic colloids in formation of
              carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic disinfection byproducts; impact of microbial
              colloids including viruses, bacteria and protozoa on water quality; role of
              particles in formation of sediments and release of associated contaminants and
              in mediating the cyclic movement of carbon and other nutrients.

The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted in response to the 1998 Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) Program Instrument Development and Acquisition
              Solicitation.  The instrumentation will be used in research being conducted in
              a collaborative effort between and among faculty in Rensselaer Polytechnic
              Institute's Departments of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Biology, and
              Earth and Environmental Science and is expected to assist it in developing a
              strong, multidisciplinary research focus on colloidal and particulate aqueous
              constituents.
