Abstract    :
              9871365  Price  The goal of this research is to develop a new high  performance
              scanning cytometer for bioengineering research.  Scanning flow cytometry
              involves imaging cells and cell  response while under flow, shear or strain
              conditions.  This  research could significantly improve both the resolution and
               time constraints governing the current state-of-the-art.  The specific aims
              include:  (1) developing the cytometry  hardware for high-resolution, high
              speed two dimensional  scanning cytometry, (2) implementing cell classifier and
               software interfaces, (3) developing a multi-day time-lapse  station for laser
              ablation or micromanipulator sorting, and  (4) initiating the development of
              high speed three  dimensional scanning cytometry.  ***
