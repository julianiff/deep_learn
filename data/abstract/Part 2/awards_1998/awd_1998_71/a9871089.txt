Abstract    :
                     The proposal involves the acquisition of a confocal laser  scanning
              microscope (CLSM) and image analysis system for a group  of cell, molecular and
              neurobiologists whose work focuses on cell  adhesion and movement, gene
              expression, protein function and  localization and neural development. The
              components were chosen to  provide 1) capability for confocal fluorescence
              imaging for  different fluorochromes in the visible spectrum, 2) ability to 
              record matching DIC images with the CLSM to assist in precise  localization of
              fluorescent labelled structures, 3) an ability to  take time-lapse confocal
              images at multiple positions in a  specimen and autofocus on the structures, 4)
              an ability to record  movements of cells using video-DIC as a framework against
              which  time-lapse CLSM images can be evaluated, 5) an ability to store  digital
              images and transfer them to a second work station for  further analysis, 6) a
              capability for mass storage of images on  computer disks and for writing to
              CDs, and 7) the ability to print  publication quality color as well as black
              and white micrographs.
