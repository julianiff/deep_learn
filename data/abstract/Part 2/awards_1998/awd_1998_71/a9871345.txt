Abstract    :
              EIA-9871345  Paul, Jerome L.  Bhatnagar, Raj K.  University of Cincinnati   
              MRI: Acquisition of a Research Network for Distributing Computing    The
              Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
              Cincinnati, in cooperation with the College of Engineering and the State of
              Ohio, proposes to acquire a high-speed research network of computer
              workstations.  The testbed will be used to support the needs of a variety for
              distributed computing systems and network protocol research projects.  The
              testbed will include a cluster of high-performance workstations locally
              connected by a high-speed LAN, with wide area connectivity provided to the
              Statewide ATM research network OCARNet.  The projects supported by the proposed
              network will exploit fundamental interconnections between theory, systems and
              applications of distributed computing, and include: validation of routing
              schemes in distributed computing environments; optimistic compiler
              optimizations; distributed decision support and data mining, and development of
              a collaborative computing environment.
