Abstract    :
              9871450  Matyjaszewski    The proposed research explores the synthesis and
              characterization  of inorganic / organic hybrid materials produced by
              controlled  polymerization of both segments.  Diblock, triblock, star and 
              comb-like copolymers will be the fundamental architectures  utilized in the
              design of the hybrids.  Polysilylenes,  polyphosphazenes and polysiloxanes will
              be used as the inorganic  segments.  Atom transfer radical polymerization
              (ATRP) of  styrenes, acrylates and methacrylates will afford organic  segments
              with predetermined molecular weights and low  polydisperisties.  The product
              composition, molecular weight,  polydispersities and architecture of the
              hybrids will influence  component miscibilities, morphologies, thermal and
              mechanical  properties.  The structural parameters of inorganic and organic 
              segments will be systematically varied to correlate them with the  macroscopic
              properties of hybrids.  %%%  Inorganic and organic polymers have several
              advantages but also  some drawbacks specific for each category.  The hybrid
              materials  synthesized by combining inorganic and organic polymers via 
              covalent linkages should enable optimization of the electronic,  optical,
              biological and environmental properties of one segment  in conjunction with
              improved mechanical properties and  processibility imparted by the other and
              explore new properties  specific for the hybrid structure.  ***
