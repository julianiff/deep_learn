Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation Program  will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at The University of California in Los   Angeles to
              acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer with a   charge-coupled device
              (CCD) area detector. This equipment will enhance   research in a number of
              areas including the following: (1) synthesis,   reactivity and catalysis of
              novel metallacarboranes, (2) studies on the   total synthesis and
              functionalization chemistry of fullerenes, (3) N-type   dopable conducting
              polymers for use as transparent cathodes in polymer   LED's, (4) transition
              metals in catalysis, and (5) organic crystal   chemistry.   The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full
              three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the
              precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule
              and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
