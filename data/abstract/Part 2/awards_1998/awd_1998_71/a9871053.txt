Abstract    :
              EIA-9871053  Sameh, Ahmed  Purdue University    MRI: Acquisition of a
              Computational Environment for Scientific Computing    This project proposes the
              acquisition of a multi-use computing platform to serve as a joint,
              top-of-the-line resource of cutting-edge research in high performance
              computing, geometric modeling and visualization and system software support for
              parallel computers.  The proposed infrastructure consists of a 32 processor SGI
              Origin 2000 (with 195 MHz R10000 processors upgradable to 250 MHz R10000, and
              subsequently to 300 MHz R12000 processors) and Infinite Reality Graphics (two
              pipes).  This infrastructure is an ideal platform for supporting various
              research activities.  It provides system software designers with a memory
              organization on which they can test and develop software capable of optimizing
              applications for deep cache hierarchies.  The distributed shared memory
              provides application developers an easy transition from serial to parallel
              programs using threaded and directive-based APIs while still supporting message
              passing libraries such as MPI.  The infinite reality engines provide powerful
              graphics and visualization capabilities for supporting computer-intensive
              design and simulation applications.  With the upgrade path to R12000 CPUs, the
              infrastructure is likely to remain a state-of-the-are computing facility for
              the next several years.
