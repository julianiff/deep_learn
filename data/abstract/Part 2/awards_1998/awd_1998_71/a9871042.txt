              Sobolewski  University of Rochester    Title: Acquisition of SEM/EDX for
              Materials and Device Research    The College Microscopy Lab at the University
              of Rochester will purchase a Philips Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope
              with EDX analysis system. The laboratory serves eight academic departments, a
              program in Biomedical Engineering, the Center for Optics Manufacturing, and the
              Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Projects include circular grating lasers,
              nanoparticle-enhanced photodetection, glass micro-optics, genetics of plant
              reproductive development, laser fusion targets, magneto rheological finishing,
              and ceramics composites CVD. Cost-sharing of over 38% is provided by the
              university.
