Abstract    :
                                                The purchase of an SGI Origin 2000 computer is
              proposed to  enable research in computationally demanding areas of  chemistry
              and structural biology.  This computational  resource will be dedicated to the
              following research areas:  (1) development and application of improved
              computational  procedures (i.e., direct methods) for determining structures  of
              very large molecules in which data were obtained by X-ray  diffraction, (2)
              application of quantum mechanical based  methods to aid the interpretation of
              X-ray diffraction  studies of transient species, (3) development and 
              application of hybrid quantum mechanical and molecular  mechanical methods for
              theoretical studies of molecules in  condensed phases, and (4) development and
              application of  improved computational methods for determining the structure 
              and energetics of large molecular systems.  The  computational facility will be
              maintained by the Center for  Computational Research at the University at
              Buffalo.  This  is a new Center created to broadly stimulate and facilitate 
              large-scale computational research at SUNY-Buffalo.
