Abstract    :
              EIA-9871329  Lauffenburger, Douglas A.  MIT    MRI:  Development of the MIT QMIP
              Network    This request pertains to an innovative initiative that brings
              together investigators from HST, CBE and the School of Engineering to further
              support an MIT wide microscopy network.  Three phases are involved: Phase I -
              The Light, fluorescent, confocal, atomic-force, and transmission electron
              microscopes will be connected to a central server/router.  Acquired images will
              be transported via high-speed ATM connections and downloaded to large capacity
              storage systems so that more complex, computer-intensive processing methods can
              be employed.  Phase II - An advanced object-oriented programming environment
              and associated database will be established.  Phase III -The network will be
              extended to an even wider group of investigators both on and off campus. 
              Accessibility of the network through the Internet will provide a powerful
              teaching tool that can be tapped by other less-advantaged institutions with a
              relatively small investment.
