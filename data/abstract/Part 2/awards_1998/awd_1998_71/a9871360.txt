Abstract    :
              ***  9871360  Khitrova  Cw and femtosecond laser/detector systems will be used
              in  the study of quantum-confined systems, both semiconductor  quantum wells
              and atoms in optical lattices.  Attention will  be directed toward the
              similarities between the two systems,  in that both are examples of localized
              structures in  periodic potentials.  This work is funded through the Major 
              Research Instrumentation Program.  ***
