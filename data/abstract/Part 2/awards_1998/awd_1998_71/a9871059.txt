Abstract    :
              Abstract  9871059  Evenson  Cosmic rays of galactic origin are deflected by the
              magnetic fields, which originate in the sun and carried outward into
              interplanetary space by the solar wind. Thus, researchers can detect
              disturbances in the solar wind by monitoring the arrival of the cosmic rays at
              Earth, and some mapping of the solar wind is even possible by measuring both
              the direction and flux of the cosmic rays.  A confusing aspect of actually
              making measurements from Earth's surface is that the incoming cosmic rays are
              also deflected by Earth's magnetic field.  It is for that reason that one can
              actually determine the direction of origin of those cosmic rays that strike the
              atmosphere.  However, because of the constant changes in the magnetic field it
              is quite valuable to make measurements of the cosmic flux while transporting a
              detector over a wide range of magnetic latitudes to larger fixed sites.  This
              Major Research Infrastructure award will build a modern cosmic ray monitor to
              be located on one of the two USCG icebreakers which are used annually to break
              a channel into the US Antarctic station, McMurdo.   When combined with a
              similar, but older, unit that is provided by the University of Hobart
              (Australia) it will be possible to make annual latitudinal surveys from Seattle
              to McMurdo and other sites, where detectors are located, with occasional trips
              to the Arctic.  A significant amount of the necessary new equipment will be
              provided by the University of Tasmania (Australia).  ***
