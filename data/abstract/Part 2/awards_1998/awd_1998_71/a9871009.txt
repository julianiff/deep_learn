Abstract    :
              9871009  Marcantonio  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Tulane
              University in collaboration with Xavier University of Louisiana provides an
              inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for study of a variety of topics
              requiring study of trace elements, and emphasizing environmental and marine
              sciences.  It will be particularly used in the analysis of uranium isotopes in
              coastal sediments, uranium-thorium disequilibrium in deep ocean sediments, and
              lead isotopes and other heavy metals in coastal and bayou samples from
              Louisiana and adjacent regions.  The facility will be housed in the existing
              Center for Bioenvironmental Research.  Faculty at both Tulane and Xavier plan
              to involve students, both graduate and undergraduate, in operation and
              application of this system to research problems.   The project is supported
              jointly by the Division of Ocean Sciences and Division of Earth Sciences at
              NSF.  Tulane University will provide cost-share support for 30% of total
              project costs.  ***
