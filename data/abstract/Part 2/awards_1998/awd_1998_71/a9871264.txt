Abstract    :
              Abstract  Babu      Funds are awarded to acquire an atomic force microscope
              capable of handling samples as large as 150 mm in diameter silicon wafers, a
              stand-alone nanoindentor, a multiple wavelength spectroscopic ellipsomenter,
              and a sputter deposition system to enhance the existing thin film
              characterization laboratory.  These instruments will be used to produce
              metallic films to be planarized and to confirm the relationships suggested by
              preliminary experiments between some of the mechanical properties (hardness,
              elastic modulus) of these films and those of the abrasive powders in the
              slurry.  In situ measurements will be made of hardness and elastic modulus
              during polishing.  Complete wafer scale mapping of the evolution of the surface
              morphology and defect structures during polishing and cleaning to determine
              within-wafer-non-uniformity.
