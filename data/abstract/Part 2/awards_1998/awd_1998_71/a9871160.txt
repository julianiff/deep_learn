Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist
              faculty in the Department of Chemistry at The University of North   Carolina in
              Charlotte to acquire a liquid chromatography-mass   spectrometry instrument for
              the Regional Analytical Chemistry Laboratory.    This dedicated atmospheric
              pressure ionization triple quadrupole mass   spectrometer with high performance
              liquid chromatograph will facilitate a   number of research projects in
              biochemistry, organometallic chemistry,   organic (including polymer)
              chemistry, and environmental chemistry.    High performance liquid
              chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric   detection is an extremely
              sensitive yet very selective tool for   identifying components of mixtures. 
              This instrument will become part of   The University of North
              Carolina-Charlotte's Regional Analytical   Chemistry Laboratory (RACHEL) in
              support of university-wide research and   the academic and industrial research
              infrastructure of the Southern   Piedmont section of the Carolinas.
