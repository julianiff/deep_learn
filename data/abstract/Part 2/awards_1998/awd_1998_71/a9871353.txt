Abstract    :
              This MRI project supports part of the development and construction of an
              instrument which will provide information on both the composition of
              atmospheric semi-volatile aerosols particles and the associated gas phase
              species in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere region. The development
              work will be accomplished through a collaboration between the California
              Institute of Technology, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),
              Georgia Tech, and CDI Corporation. The instrument will be light-weight and
              autonomously operated on board of an ER-2 research aircraft. The technique of
              selected ion chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (SICIMS) will be combined
              with novel virtual impactor inlets to separate the gas phase from the aerosols.
              Central to this program is the design of a suitable calibration system that can
              be used during atmospheric observations. Also as part of this program,
              laboratory studies will be carried out at Caltech to develop and calibrate new
              ion techniques for detection of atmospherically important species such as
              peroxynitric acid and ammonia.
