Abstract    :
              9871100  Wheless  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Old Dominion
              University in Virginia provides a high performance multi-processor computer for
              modeling and visualization in the ocean sciences.  It will be particularly used
              in research on Chesapeake Bay estuarine dynamics and in various physical and
              biological oceanography modeling studies.  The computer will be used in courses
              for both graduate and undergraduate students in marine sciences, and by
              graduate students in research projects.  The project is supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Old Dominion University will provide
              cost-share support for more than 30% of total project costs.  ***
