Abstract    :
              This project will provide a substantial, on-line collection of primary
              historical data that will reveal the interplay among sanitary engineering,
              laboratory science, social and cultural understandings of the determinants of
              disease, and urban transformation.  The project has three intermediate
              objectives.  First, we will digitize three sets of rare and hard-to-use
              documents that describe the creation and transformation of the New York City
              Department of Health, one of the most important social institutions of the
              nineteenth and twentieth centuries:  the 1865 report on the `Sanitary Condition
              of the City,` the `Annual Reports of the New York City Department of Health`
              from its creation in 1865 through 1920, and the 1890 compilation `Vital
              Statistics of New York City and Brooklyn.`  Second, these materials will form
              the backbone of a new web site, `Health, Wealth and the City:  Engineering
              Social and Urban Change in New York City, 1865-1920.`  As part of the site we
              will create interfaces for users to search and download the text and tables of
              the above documents, and will also host course syllabi and materials for
              distance learning.  Third, we will integrate such materials into the curriculum
              of Columbia's Program in the History of Public Health and Medicine and use them
              as the basis for faculty and student research.
