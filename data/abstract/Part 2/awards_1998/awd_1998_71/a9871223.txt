Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist   the faculty
              in the Department of Chemistry at North Dakota State   University to acquire a
              500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research on elucidating
              the structures of silicon-containing   heterocycles and oligosilanes, aid in
              the stereoselective synthesis of   unusual amino acids, nitrogen heterocycles
              and alkaloids, and facilitate   the design and development of chiral catalytic
              methods for the   preparation of small organic molecules with high enantiomeric
              purity.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
                It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
