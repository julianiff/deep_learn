Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist
              faculty in the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University   to acquire
              a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This   equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas, including studies   on lead toxicity by
              investigations of lead-protein interactions,   synthesis and chemistry of
              chalcogenometallates, studies in   organometallic and coordination chemistry,
              characterization of transition   metal complexes via one- and two-dimensional
              NMR methods, mechanistic   studies of chiral polymerization catalysts, and NMR
              studies of enzyme   active sites.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these studies have potential
              technological   impact in areas such as catalysis, handling of toxins in the
              environment,   and advanced materials.
