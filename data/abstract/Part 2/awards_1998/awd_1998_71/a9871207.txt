	Under the MRI Program, the Principal Investigator will upgrade
              and improve a mobile Doppler radar system known as the Doppler on Wheels (DOW).
               The current systems have provided unique data on both tornadoes and hurricane
              substructures.  It is anticipated that the upgraded systems will provide better
              reliability and accuracy of the  antenna control system and provide the
              construction and test of a prototype bistatic capability.  Bistatic radar
              networks are capable of measuring vector wind fields using a single transmitter
              and one or more passive remotely located receivers.  Since bistatic receivers
              are inexpensive, easy to field, and do not require large scanning antennas or
              transmitters, they are capable of being deployed en masse surrounding weather
              of interest, using signals from a nearby transmitting DOW.
	Due to their
              ability to be brought close to atmospheric phenomena, the DOWs can generally
              provide much higher resolution data than can be obtained from fixed site
              radars.  It is anticipated that unique data sets will be forthcoming from a
              wide range of meteorological phenomena including tornadoes, hurricanes,
              microbursts, and orographic precipitation.
