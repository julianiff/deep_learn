Fibers optic sensors possess particular advantages over
              conventional electrical and/or electro-mechanical based sensors.  An
              application of fiber optic sensors is within the civil structures arena
              resulting in the notion of a ""smart structure""- a structure with embedded
              sensing capabilities.  We have been involved in this research arena for a
              number of years culminating in the embedding of fiber optic sensors into large
              civil structures such as buildings, bridges, roadways and a hydroelectric
              dam.

Funds are requested for the purchase of photonic test equipment to
              significantly enhance ongoing research activities in smart structures and fiber
              optic sensing.   In order to use the advances in sensor technology requires a
              major updating of the equipment infrastructures used to extract measurements
              from these embedded sensors.
