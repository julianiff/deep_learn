Abstract    :
              ***  9871096  Williams  This grant will establish at the University of
              Pennsylvania  a facility for the development of integrated circuits for  the
              study of elementary particle interactions and neutrino  astrophysics.  This
              facility will include the equipment  necessary for testing analog, digital, and
              mixed  analog/digital circuits.  The research program supported by this
              facility will include  development and testing of sophisticated integrated
              circuits  developed for a number of experiments, including the  Collider
              Detector Facility at Fermilab and the ATLAS  experiment at the LHC.  ***
