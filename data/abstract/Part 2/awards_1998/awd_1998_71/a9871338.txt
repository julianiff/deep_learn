              ABSTRACT     CTS-9871338  David T. Wu, Louis J. Guido, Gary L. Povirk  Yale
              University    Title: Acquisition of High Resolution X-Ray Diffractometer for
              Materials Research    The departments of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering
              at Yale University will purchase a Philips X'PERT Materials Research
              Diffractometer system with a wide range of options. Cost-sharing of over 47% is
              provided by the university. The primary uses will be in materials science
              projects, including Synthesis of Semiconductor Thin Films, Material Length
              Scales in Metal Plasticity, and Dynamics of Grain Growth. The equipment will be
              used also to enhance the teaching of materials science.
