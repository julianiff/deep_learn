Abstract    :
              9871026  Clark  The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) proposes the
              acquisition of capital equipment at three NNUN sites to significantly increase
              our ability to serve the microelectro-mechanics (MEMS) user community.  NNUN is
              a consortium of five leading university nanofabrication facilities providing
              nanofabrication user services to the R&D community.      MEMS comprises one of
              the most technically exciting and commercially attractive areas of
              nanotechnology. MEMS entails the application of nanofabrication techniques,
              similar to those used for fabricating electronic devices, to the fabrication of
              micro- or nano- sized moving parts and systems.  While still embryonic, the
              potential for MEMS to impact a wide number of technologies is huge.  These
              applications include motion sensors, alignment systems for integrated optics,
              steerable mirror arrays, microwave components, high Q electromechanical
              filters, miniaturized scanning probe microscopes, microanalytical instruments,
              and a large number of biomedical devices, for example, hearing aids
              biomimetically based upon insect systems.    Currently over 50 MEMS projects
              are supported within the NNUN.  It is one of the most rapidly growing areas of
              user interest.    In this proposal, the PIs provide justification for the
              acquisition of the following equipment which will enable the NNUN to better
              serve the MEMS community:    *Cornell                           High Density
              ICP Plasma Deposition System  *Penn State  Enhanced Field Emission Scanning
              Electron Microscope  *Stanford  Laser Pattern Generation System, High Density
              ICP Plasma Etch System  ***
