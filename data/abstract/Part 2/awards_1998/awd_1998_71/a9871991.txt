Abstract    :
              9871991  Ward  Center for Technology-Based Business Development  The University
              of Maine will create a Center for Technology-Based  Business Development to
              address Maine s shortcomings in the  creation of technology-based businesses
              and net exportation of it s  science and engineering graduates, as well as
              university based R&D.  Strong, decisive action will be taken to provide
              opportunities for  Maine-based technologies and students to develop companies
              in  Maine. This strategy is consistent with the state s Science and  Technology
              Plan and the state s economic development strategy .   The Center will build on
              the University of Maine s successful  industrial activity, and the practical
              experience of many other  research institutions. The Center will develop the
              necessary  organizational structure including: (1) an entrepreneurial 
              environment for faculty, student and industry interaction, a pro-  active
              technology transfer office with business development  expertise; shared labs;
              (2) equipment and incubation space for  small technology-based start-ups; and
              (3) new programs to educate  and encourage graduate-student and faculty
              entrepreneurs. The  multi-disciplinary activity will be directed at the state s
              and the  university s five targeted technology areas. This activity will 
              establish a critical piece of business development infrastructure  currently
              unavailable in Maine and allow the University of Maine to  take a leading role
              in technology transfer related economic  development.
