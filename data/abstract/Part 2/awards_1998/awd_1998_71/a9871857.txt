Abstract    :
              9871857  Van Atta    The project is for a laboratory study of stratified 
              turbulent flow.  The measurements consist of rapid vertical  profiling and
              sampling, rather than Eulerian point  measurements.  The study will allow
              assessment of individual  terms in the turbulent kinetic energy and fluctuating
               potential energy balances, thus providing vital information  for understanding
              ocean micro-structure measurements and  ocean mixing.
