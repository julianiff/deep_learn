Abstract    :
                                        06/19/98    This proposal will fund the purchase of a
              computing cluster  to support computational biology research at Montana State 
              University.  The computing equipment will be used for  multidisciplinary
              research in the general areas of  Neurosciences, Population Ecology,
              Biochemistry, and  Structural Biology.  The major users will be 12 faculty from
               four different departments at Montana State University:  Biology, Chemistry
              and Biochemistry, Mathematics, and  Computer Science.  A total of 11 postdocs
              and 27 graduate  students in these faculty labs will use the equipment for 
              their research projects.  This computer cluster will also  directly support
              research projects involving numerous  undergraduate students, including those
              enrolled in several  special programs for minority students.  These students
              will  have access to the equipment though their involvement in  research
              projects sponsored by the faculty users.
