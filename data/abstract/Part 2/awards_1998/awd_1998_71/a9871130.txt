Abstract    :
                                              This award provides funds to purchase a 600 MHz
              solid-state  NMR spectrometer for structural biology studies at Brandeis 
              University.  This spectrometer will be equipped primarily  for high-resolution
              solution work as required by several of  the Principal Investigators.  The
              studies that will be  undertaken with this equipment include studies of the 
              structure-function relationships in electron transfer  couples, the structure
              and mechanism of a prokaryotic K+  channel, the structure-function
              relationships in a new class  of metalloenzymes, the mapping of hydrophobic
              binding sites  on Interleukin 1, the structure of a serpin-protease  complex,
              and the correlation between protein dynamics and  function.  The acquisition of
              the spectrometer will allow  Brandeis University to remain a vital center of
              research in  structural biology.
