Abstract    :
              9871922  Strobel  Montana EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement  The 1998 EPSCoR grant to
              the state of Montana will provide  resources to strengthen the research base of
              the Ph.D. granting  institutions of the state   Montana State University and
              The  University of Montana.  This strengthening will be done by hiring  up to
              18 new research competitive people in the areas of materials  science,
              structural/functional biology and environmental sciences.   The undergraduate
              research participation will also be increased  along with the addition of up to
              30 graduate students.  Faculty  development programs and activities to
              strengthen Montana s  businesses are also included in this project.  Several
              new  equipment items will be added to enhance Montana s physical  scientific
              infrastructure.  Milestone measurements of Montana s  improvements in research
              competitiveness will be made.  We  anticipate improvements in SBIR activity,
              numbers of NSF and NIH  grants, major research accomplishments,
              university/local business  ties, and state support of science.
