Funding is requested by research groups from Rutgers and
              Ohio State Universities to study properties of and develop a detector that is
              positioned close to the interaction region of Colliders, the primary
              accelerator facility of high energy physics.  The proposed detectors are
              constructed by use of Chemical Vapor Deposition techniques, which results in a
              film diamond, a substance that can withstand the high doses of radiation
              produced by high luminosity collisions.  Such detectors are critical to the
              next generation of collider experiments in elementary particle physics.
