Abstract    :
              Abstract    9871894, Schadler/RPI    Recent work has shown that the modulus,
              strain to failure, and strength of polymer composites can be increased
              simultaneously with nanosized particle filler.  This is not observed in micron
              sized filled systems.  This proposal has dual objectives: 1) to create and
              investigate novel nanofiller/polymer composites for engineering application
              sand 2) to develop a fundamental understanding of their structure-property
              relationships through understanding the effects of particle dispersion,
              particle structure and surface chemistry, and polymer chain stiffness on the
              size of the bound polymer layer and on the mechanical properties.   
              Nanoparticle fillers will be synthesized using the gas condensation method.  A
              wide range of metal, ceramic, and composite nanoparticles will be synthesized
              in the size (diameter) range of 5-50 nm by this method.   In addition, the
              nanoparticles can be coated to modify their surfaces.  Nanofiller/polymer
              composites will be prepared using elastomers, thermoplastics, and thermosets. 
              Microstructural characterization will be done using a variety of techniques
              such as TEM, SEM and X-ray diffraction.  The effect of the nanoparticle on the
              surrounding polymer region will be used to confirm the NMR observations on a
              more macroscopic scale.  Micro-Raman spectroscopy will be used to gain an
              understanding of the micro(nano)mechanical behavior.  The measured mechanical
              properties of these new composites will be compared with those of existing
              fiber and particle filled composites.    This research is relevant to
              fabrication of high modulus, high strength polymer composites.  Research on the
              fabrication and testing of nanocomposites will complement an educational
              initiative at RPI on nanomaterials.     This project results from a proposal
              submitted in response to NSF 98-20, Partnership in Nanotechnology:  Synthesis,
              Processing, and Utilization of Functional Nanostructures (FNS).
