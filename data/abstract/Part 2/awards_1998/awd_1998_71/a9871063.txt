Abstract    :
                           This proposal is to develop a simultaneous two-photon excitation 
              and confocal laser          scanning microscope optimized for multi-color
              fluorescence imaging  of living cells and          tissues. Over the last
              decade, it has become apparent that the cell  cannot be regarded as          a
              'bag of chemicals' that carries out biological reactions. The  exact
              three-dimensional          arrangement of the cellular components is
              tremendously important,  as are the time-dependent          changes in this
              arrangement during the cell cycle and upon  interaction with a variety of cell
              activators          (neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors, etc.). Recent
              advances,          such as two-photon excitation microscopy and the Green
              Fluorescent          Protein (GFP), now allow high resolution imaging of living
              cells with minimal effects on cell viability.  Considerable eff          ort
              has been devoted over the last five years to develop          quantitative
              laser scanning microscopies (imaging of NAD(P)H, Indo-          1, and GFP by  
                     two-photon excitation, and imaging of GFP mutants by confocal         
              microscopy), and now have          determined optimal parameters for each of
              these imaging modes.          However, to understand the          relationships
              between cellular arrangement, dynamics, and function,          it is necessary
              to          examine individual cells from multiple perspectives. Multi-        
               parameter imaging of living.          cells has been used effectively with
              widefield microscopy. For          imaging of thick tissues,          though,
              an optical sectioning microscopy, such as confocal or two-          photon
              excitation, is          needed.          The proposed instrument will be built
              around a Zeiss LSM510          confocal microscope,          added with lasers
              for two-photon excitation and optimized          excitation of GFP mutants.  A
              non-descanned detection channel will          be installed for optimized
              detection of two-photon excited           fluorescence.  Installation of this
              detector will permit testing          true photon counting electronics and
              different detectors, such as a          cooled PMT or avalanche photodiode.
              This new instrument will allow          researchers to combine multiple imaging
              modes that they have          optimized separately. As an example, they can use
              two-photon          excitation imaging to  monitor cellular metabolic activity
              (by NAD(P)H autofluorescence)          and confocal imaging to GEP fusion
              proteins to study specific          protein translocations that may affect
              metabolism.     Currently,          these two experiments must be done on two
              separate instruments          which prohibits direct correlations at the single
              cell level. With          the proposed instrument, such experiments can he
              performed on the          same cell at the same time by confocal imaging of GFP
              and two-          photon excitation imaging of NAD(P)H.  An alternative imaging
                       method is the use of two-photon excitation to image both GFP and      
                 NAD(P)H by utilizing dual emission filters to          measure each
              flluorophore simultaneously. The new instrument will          work in either   
                    configuration, and can thus be used to rapidly determine the         
              preferable method for each          application.               Once this
              instrument is developed and tested, it will become          part of the
              Vanderbilt          University Cell Imaging Resource. The resource has three
              staff          members, and is currently          used by more than 70 labs
              from the medical center and 4 from other          campus units. It         
              contains two microscopes, a confocal laser scanning microscope and          a
              conventional          fluorescence microscope with an ultralow light level CCD
              camera,          plus several computers          for data analysis and high
              quality image output. Inclusion of this          new microscope in the         
              imaging resource will allow its efficient administration,           facilitate
              the transfer of new          developments to a large number of researchers, and
              create a unique,          full-service resource          dedicated to live cell
              imaging.
