Abstract    :
              This grant will support the construction of an important new addition to the
              National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. 
              This will consist of a 4 Tesla compact superconducting sweeper magnet for radio
              active beam experiments, which will make possible the production of unstable
              nuclei along the "neutron dripline".  The combination of this new sweeper
              magnet, together with the existing 5800 spectrograph, will allow simultaneous
              high resolution momentum distribution measurements of the fragments and
              neutrons produced in the decay of these nuclei.  The magnet will also make
              possible new studies of unstable nuclei near the "proton dripline".
