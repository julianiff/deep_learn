Abstract    :
              9871468  Powell  This award to University of Miami in the state of Florida will
              provide instrumentation for oceanographic research on a new coastal research
              vessel being built to replace R/V Calanus.  The new vessel will be operated by
              Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  Specific
              instruments to be acquired under this Major Research Instrumentation award from
              the Division of Ocean Sciences include a dynamic position system, motion and
              position sensors, a subbottom profiling system, a clean sea water system with
              inline attachment of instruments for underway surveying of surface waters, an
              undulating profiler for study of water and plankton properties, and a fiber
              optic network and associated computers for data acquisition, analysis and
              display.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists from a wide variety of US laboratories conduct studies in coastal
              regions of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.  ***
