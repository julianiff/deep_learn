Abstract    :
              9871243  Rosenberg    This award provides 46% of the funds required for the
              acquisition  and installation of a scanning electron microscope to be operated 
              by the Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis 
              (IU-PU-Indianapolis) for the benefit of staff and students from a  wide range
              of campus units including the departments of Geology,  Biology, Physics,
              Chemistry, the Center for Earth and Environmental  Sciences, and the schools of
              Dentistry, Medicine, and Engineering.  Individuals from neighboring Butler
              University will also use the  facility.  IU-PU-Indianapolis is committed to
              providing the  remaining funds necessary for the acquisition and will also
              provide  for technician support and service contracts for long-term 
              maintenance. The instrument system is capable of producing images  and
              quantitative elemental analyses at microscopic levels necessary  for research
              and teaching applications in a wide variety of fields.  ***
