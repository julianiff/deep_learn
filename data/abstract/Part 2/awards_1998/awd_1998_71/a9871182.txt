Abstract    :
              9871182  Windom  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Skidaway Institute
              of Oceanography in Georgia provides an inductively coupled plasma-mass
              spectrometer and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer to replace existing,
              aging, instrumentation for study of a variety of research problems involving
              trace elements analyses, and emphasizing environmental and marine sciences. The
              facility provides analytical capabilities for a number of researchers within
              the University of Georgia system and in other universities in the Southeast,
              and the new instrumentation will be housed in the existing analytical facility
              at Skidaway Institute, which will be upgraded to accommodate them. Skidaway
              Institute will provide cost-share support for 30% of total project costs.  ***
