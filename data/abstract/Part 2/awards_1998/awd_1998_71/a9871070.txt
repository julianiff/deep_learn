This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
              new type of ion microprobe analysis system that will be installed and operated
              in the McDonnell Center for space Sciences at Washington University in St.
              Louis.  The University and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency are
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition.  The
              new ion microprobe is based on a novel ion optics design developed in France
              that permits very fine focusing of the primary incident ion beam to less than a
              micron diameter (for excellent spatial resolution of analysis) in combination
              with high secondary ion yields for unprecedented mass resolution in
              microanalysis.  Initial applications of the new facility will focus on the
              study of isotopic and elemental compositions in pre-solar and other
              fine-grained exterrestrial materials, leading to better understanding of
              cosmochemistry, the evolution of galaxies, stars and planets.
