This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
              secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS or ion microprobe) that will be installed
              and operated in the Geology Department at Arizona State University.  Arizona
              State University and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency are committed to
              providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition.  The instrument is
              capable of precise in situ quantitative analysis of trace elements and rare
              isotopes in natural solid samples, with spatial resolution of approximately ten
              microns.  The new ion microprobe will be devoted mainly to research and
              graduate-level teaching in a range of investigations dealing with the early
              history of the solar system, planetary atmospheres, the origin of life on earth
              and, possibly, other planets, the origin of terrestrial magmas, and the role of
              aqueous fluids in environmental geochemistry and diagenesis.
