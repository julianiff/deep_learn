Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS9871010  Ting, F.      Funds are awarded to acquire a three
              component fiber optic laser doppler velocimeter.  The system will be used for
              basic studies of turbulent three- dimensional vortical flow around the piers
              and is characterized by the formation of scour holes around the foundation. 
              Improved description of the structure of this turbulent is critical to the
              development of accurate and efficient computational methods of predicting
              scour.
