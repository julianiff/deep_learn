Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:

The Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois plans
              to purchase  purchase two high-end compute servers, a number of workstations
              for the SymComLab in the Mathematics Department, and some necessary related
              equipment and services.   This will be dedicated to the support of research in
              the mathematical sciences.  The research will be used for several research
              projects including in particular: 

1) Aimo Hinkkanen, Complex dynamics and
              the geometry of quasiregular  maps,

2) Leon McCulloh, Class number formulas
              for integral group
rings, 

3) Joseph Rosenblatt, Computational aspects of
              phase retrieval,

4) Paul Schupp, The structure of Hamiltonian cycles in 
              Cayley graphs,

5) Kenneth Stolarsky, Factorization and zero distribution of
              families of polynomials.

Support for this project comes from the National
              Science Foundation
SCREMS program, from the Mathematics Department at the
              University of
Illinois in Urbana/Champaign, from the Research Board at
              the
University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign, and from the Vice
Chancellor
              for Research at the University of Illinois in
Urbana/Champaign.  It is planned
              to
