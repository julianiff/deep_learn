Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for the establishment of an analytical  ultracentrifuge
              facility on the Homewood campus of Johns  Hopkins University.  Initially this
              facility will support  the research of 12 faculty members in the areas of 
              Biochemistry, Biophysics and Cell and Molecular Biology.  The use of this
              facility for the analysis of the  hydrodynamic properties of molecular
              assemblies will be  highly complementary with the work carried out by these 
              groups at the Biocalorimeter Center on campus.  Research to  use the facility
              will include studies of histones and  nucleosomes; repeat-protein functions in
              signal  transduction; the galactose repressor; new strategies for  molecular
              targeting and drug design; regulatory interactions  in RNA icosahedral plant
              viruses; control of HIV-1 and HSV-1  infection by plant lignans; and oligomers
              of staph nuclease.
