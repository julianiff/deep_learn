Abstract    :
              9871047  Jones  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Old Dominion
              provides a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer with
              laser ablation system for environmental and ocean sciences research.  It will
              be particularly used in research on fish recruitment dynamics, population
              structure and migration patterns, biogeochemistry of sulfur and metalloid
              elements, and complexation and speciation of trace metals in estuarine, coastal
              and open ocean settings.  The facility will involve graduate students in
              research, and undergraduates through its ongoing internship program.  The
              project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Old Dominion
              University will provide cost-share support for more than 35% of total project
              costs.  ***
