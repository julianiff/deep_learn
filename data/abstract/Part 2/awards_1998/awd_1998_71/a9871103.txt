Abstract    :
                This project involves the purchase, installation and use of  an Environmental
              Scanning Electron Microscope to be housed in  the Microscopy Suite Facility of
              the Beckman Institute at the  University of Illinois, Champaign. The requested
              instrument  will provide the only access to environmental SEM and the  only
              instrument available for biological research on the UIUC  campus. This
              instrument provides the unique capability for  examining specimens with a field
              emission source electron  beam at a residual gas pressure range in the specimen
              chamber  which can exceed the saturated water vapor pressure. Thus, 
              water-containing samples can be viewed without prior drying.  The instrument
              will be used by over 20 research groups  involved in a broad range of research
              including biomaterials,  plant lichens, insect antennal tissue and textiles.
