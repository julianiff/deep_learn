Abstract    :
              EIA-9871219  Betke, Margrit  Clote, Peter G.  Boston College    MRI: Research
              Laboratory for Computer Science    The objective of the requested equipment is
              to support on-going research in the Computer Science Department at Boston
              College.  In addition to longstanding emphasis on theoretical aspects of
              computer science, several applied projects are now underway within the
              department including projects in computer vision, computer-human interfaces,
              database systems, computational biology, distributed simulation and computer
              technology. In order to support these projects, the Computer Science Department
              is establishing a dedicated Research Laboratory for Computer Science.  This
              laboratory is designed to support a wide range of research and develop
              activities by faculty members, their collaborators, and students.  These
              research efforts include: experiments with digital cameras for computer vision
              research; database systems design; parallel algorithm development for
              computational biology research; experiments with a new robotic wheelchair and
              an LCD projector for computer-human interfaces and 3D-modeling software
              development.  This project proposes to equip the laboratory with 10
              high-performance Pentium II 333MHz workstations, one Tinman robotic wheelchair,
              one LCD projector, and several digital cameras together with supporting
              hardware and software.
