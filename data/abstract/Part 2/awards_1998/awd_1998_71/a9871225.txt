Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Calvin College to   acquire a
              scanning probe microscopy system.  The scanning probe   microscopy research
              laboratory will enhance the research program of   faculty and students in a
              number of areas including the following:  1)   structural characterization of
              polymer brushes in a range of solvents, 2)   structural characterization of
              self-assembled films on surfaces, 3)   magnetic domain structure in
              ferromagnetic thin films, 4) molecular   adhesion and lubricant properties of
              synovial fluids and artificial tears   on polymeric surfaces.    The scanning
              probe microscope is a versatile tool that has the ability to   obtain surface
              structural information with high spatial resolution, as   well as the ability
              to measure local mechanical and magnetic properties   of surfaces.  It will
              also give science students training in the use of   this instrument which has
              applications in biology, chemistry and physics.    A unique aspect of this
              program is to provide both interdisciplinary and   cross-disciplinary research
              and educational activities to faculty and   their student collaborators at an
              undergraduate institution.
