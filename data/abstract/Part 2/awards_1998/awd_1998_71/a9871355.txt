The acquisition of the mechanical properties microprobe (MPM)
              system (Nano Indenterfi II) is to be used primarily to support graduate
              education and training and conduct research in materials science and
              engineering.  The MPM provides new dimensions in testing and analysis for many
              engineering research programs within the college, particularly in the Materials
              Science and the Electrical Engineering Departments, and the university at
              large.  Ongoing research in the College of Natural Science will also benefit
              from having access to the nanoindenter.  The naniondenter will be a first of
              its kind on site of Michigan State University.  Many diverse research groups
              that are involved in the characterization of materials and in nanomechanical
              stress analysis will benefit significantly from the acquisition of the MPM. 
              This is especially the case for characterization of the small-volumes, thin
              films and interfaces in materials.  Some research programs will use the MPM to
              determine the hardness, modulus and fracture energy of thin films and
              nanolayered materials.
