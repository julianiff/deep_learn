Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              and the Major Research Instrumentation Program will enable the   faculty in the
              Department of Chemistry at The University of North Dakota   to acquire a 400
              MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance   research in a variety of
              different areas of chemistry, including organic,   bioorganic, synthetic
              carbohydrate, inorganic, and analytical chemistry.    The instrumentation will
              be used in several research projects, such as,   studies of carcinogen-DNA
              interactions, stereoselective synthesis of   disaccharides and related
              compounds, reactions of early/late transition   metal dimers with organosulfur
              compounds, electron transfer reactions,   and others.  The NMR spectrometer
              will also be available for teaching   graduate and undergraduate students to
              obtain and interpret the kinds of   spectra (2D) that are unavailable with the
              current instrumentation.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
              the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances,
              characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study
              the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the
              areas such   as synthetic chemistry, catalysis, and in biology.
