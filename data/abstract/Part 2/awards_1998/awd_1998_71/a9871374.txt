NSF Program : 1189      MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION

Abstract    :
                   Most major users of the proposed instrumentation already have DNA  sequence
              data sets in hand that are in excess of 100 taxa. Prior NSF-  sponsored ABI
              automated sequencer instrumentation (1995-96) has resulted  in a remarkable
              increase in the output of quality DNA sequence data that  has led to a highly
              unbalanced situation where "cutting-edge" technology  is available to generate
              molecular data, but researchers are confined to  using inadequate computers for
              the phylogenetic analyses of these data  sets. Field Museum researchers in the
              Biochemistry Lab have flooded all  locally available computing resources with
              phylogenetic analyses of DNA  sequence data that have been generated for its
              new and innovative  research. This proposal funds the acquisition of
              significant additional  computing resources needed to complete and continue
              important new  projects made possible by the Lab's existing equipment for
              isolating DNA,  PCR amplification, and automated generation of DNA sequence
              data (ABI 377  automated sequencer). It is not only the generation of these DNA
              data  sets that makes a molecular evolution and systematics research program 
              strong, but how well those data are analyzed and interpreted.
