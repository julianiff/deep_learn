Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Purdue University to acquire a   shared facility for
              rapid access and analysis of massive data blocks,   known as RAMDATA.  The
              facility will allow research groups to process   massive data blocks (i.e., 100
              to 10,000 gigabytes) and greatly   facilitate new image studies at the light
              sources at Brookhaven and   Argonne National Laboratories as well as reaction
              studies at the   Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and Relativistic Heavy
              Ion   Collider (RHIC) particle accelerators.    An important prerequisite for
              success in accelerator-based research is a   facility for accessible storage
              and fast processing of large data blocks.    For example, in nuclear reaction
              studies, modern devices for high   resolution three dimensional tracking of the
              trajectories of reaction   products yield several terabytes (trillion bytes) of
              data output for a   typical experiment.  Meanwhile, data generation is
              continuing to grow at   an even faster rate.  High speed, high volume data
              handling capabilities are   needed in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging
              from astronomy to   particle physics.
