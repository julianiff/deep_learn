A high resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometer will be
              purchased under this Major Research Instrumentation award.  The instrument
              includes a high-resolution, high-transmission efficiency, and high m/z range
              double focusing mass analyzer.  The mass spectrometer is equipped with a
              standard electron impact/chemical ionization ion source, as well as easily
              interchangeable fast atom bombardment, electrospray ionization and field
              desorption/ionization sources.  The configuration also includes two collision
              cells and a linked scan unit providing tandem capabilities.  Major users of the
              instrument include groups from the Department of Polymer Science and the
              Department of Chemistry.  The instrument will also benefit a large group of
              minor users from other departments such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,
              Veterinary and Animal Science, Department of Chemical Engineering, Food
              Science.  It will also be used by researchers from Amherst College and Mt.
              Holyoke College.  The 16 research groups that will be users of the mass
              spectrometer include 22 post-doctoral fellows, 82 graduate students and 33
              undergraduate students.

The high resolution magnetic sector mass
              spectrometer purchased with the Major Research  Instrumentation award will
              become a part of the University of Massachusetts' Mass Spectrometry Center. 
              Because of its high resolution, unmatched mass accuracy and a variety of
              ionization modes, the new instrument will greatly expand the analytical
              capabilities offered by the Center.
