Abstract    :
                   Over the past few years there has been tremendous  advances in the
              sensitivity of mass spectrometers for  peptide sequencing, the ability of
              parent ion scanning  approaches to rapidly detect and identify a plethora of 
              protein posttranslational modifications and the promise of  gentle ionization
              techniques to extend mass spectroscopy  into the realm of non-covalent protein
              interactions and  folding. These techniques have been disseminated slowly 
              because of the small number of laboratories with  demonstrated track record in
              these new techniques. The  current proposal is intended to bring
              state-of-the-art mass  spectroscopy to Yale University through the purchase of
              a  QTOF mass spectrometer. This instrument will support  research in 10
              institutions that do not currently have a  comparable instrument. The projects
              include a broad spectrum  of biological research areas including tRNA
              synthesis; pre-  mRNA maturation; early neurogenesis; the control of cellular 
              differentiation and growth; intracellular membrane  transport; protein
              structure and dynamics; the generation of  antigen receptor diversity; and the
              role of cell surface  glycosylation in establishing cellular identity.
