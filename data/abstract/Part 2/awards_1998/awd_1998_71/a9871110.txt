Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  CTS-9871110    Principal Investigator:  D.
              Prieve, G. Berry, R. Tilton,  A. Jacobson, L. Walker      Funds are awarded to
              purchase equipment for the Colloids, Polymers, and Surfaces (CPS) Laboratory. 
              This lab serves as a central facility for graduate and undergraduate research
              and research training and as a teaching laboratory to accompany lecture
              courses.  The equipment will be used to study interparticle forces which are
              responsible for the physical properties and material behavior of complex
              fluids.  Some of the research projects which this equipment will support are:
              equilibrium vs. non-equilibrium forces; effects of adsorbed polymers on van der
              Waals attraction; colloidal forces in polymer-surfactant mixtures; the
              influence of interfacial adsorption on the rheology of two phase materials;
              wetting and spreading of complex fluids; light scattering and rheological
              studies on thermally reversible gels.
