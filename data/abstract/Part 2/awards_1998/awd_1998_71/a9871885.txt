              ABSTRACT:      Proposal Number:  CTS 9871885    Principal Investigator:  D.
              Rosner, J. de la Mora, M. Long, W. Tong                                        
                                                                                             
                                                    This proposal was submitted in response
              to the Nanotechnology Initiative (NSF 98-20).  The award is to support the
              interdisciplinary science and technology behind producing controlled
              nanostructured coatings at high deposition rates by circumventing the presence
              of aggregates.  The proposed work involves the following parallel activities: 
              High flux flame synthesis of aggregates comprised of nearly mono-sized
              nanometer spherules with controlled dimensions, properties, and strength; the
              development of laser induced incandescence to obtain aggregate parameters on
              line; resonant impaction to break the aggregate into primary spherules and to
              obtain pre-sintered coatings of controlled granular density and morphology;
              post deposition treatment to optimize the properties of the resulting ceramic
              or metallic coatings.  Successful completion of these projects would provide
              high throughput production of nano-phase materials with a simple and
              environmentally sound process.
