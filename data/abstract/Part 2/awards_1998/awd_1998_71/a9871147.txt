                Title: Acquisition of an X-Ray Diffractometer for the Study of Thin Films and
              Nanostructured Materials    The Virginia Microelectronics Center at the
              Virginia Commonwealth University will purchase a Philips X'PERT Materials
              Research Diffractometer  for the study of nanostructured materials, research
              training of graduate and undergraduate students in Electrical Engineering,
              Physics, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering, and for materials
              characterization training of students of semiconductor science and technology.
              The instrument will be made available to local community colleges and high
              schools. Research projects will include: deposition of In,Al-GaN
              heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy and organometallic vapor phase
              epitaxy (Morkoc); structure of thin-film semiconductor/metal multilayers
              (Carlisle and Baski); structure of oxide and nitride nanoparticles (El-Shall);
              microphase structure of ion-conducting self-assembling block copolymer films
              (Wnek). The university will match 47% of the instrument cost. The apparatus
              will be managed by Dr. Morkoc.
