Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support,  Dr. Craig Spencer of Augustana
              College will purchase gamma counter to date 210Pb. The system, produced by Eg&G
              Ortec consists of an integrated system which includes a well-type, germanium
              detector (HPGa, GWL-120230) with an extra-low background cryostat, a lead
              shield and a 3-l Liter Dewar. The system includes a digital signal processing
              based gamma-ray spectrometer which is interfaced to a PC (Gateway Model P5-150)
              equipped with software developed by EG & Gortec for signal processing and data
              analysis. The system is designed to detect very low levels of activity, a
              capability particularly important in obtaining reliable dates for older
              sediment samples.  Dr. Spencer and his collaborators will continue their
              paleolimnological studies in northwestern Montana to examine human environment
              interactions over the last ca. one hundred years. They have collected lake
              cores from regions which have undergone logging and are attempting to determine
              the effect of logging on such variables as mass sedimentation rate. Data from
              logging records as well as examination of satellite photographs permit
              determination of number of acreage harvested. Analysis of cores can provide
              information on changes in vegetation and trophic state of the lake as well as
              sedimentation rate.  In such work accurate dating is essential an the gamma-ray
              spectrometer provides a means to accomplish this. Augustana College is an
              undergraduate institution and the instrumentation will serve an important
              teaching as well as research function.
