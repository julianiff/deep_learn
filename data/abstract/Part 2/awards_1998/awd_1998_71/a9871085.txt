Using funding from the Major Research Instrumentation program,
              researchers at Florida State University (FSU) will develop an apparatus for low
              temperature thin film growth that will be incorporated in a unique dilution
              refrigeration system with a base temperature of 20 mK.  With this apparatus the
              PIs will be capable of growing one dimensional nanostructures and thin films
              under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and performing in situ low temperature
              electrical characterization on them.  When used in conjunction with nano-scale
              stencil masks, the cross-sectional area of a low dimensional sample can be
              varied, tuning it through the insulator-superconductor (or "metal") transition
              and probing the phase transition down to 20 mK without undergoing sample change
              or thermal cycling.  The centerpiece of the setup is a commercially available
              dilution refrigerator, which will be customized to accommodate the necessary
              accessories for the film growth.  Such a system will facilitate studies of
              quantum phase transition, quantum fluctuations and interference effect under
              restricted dimensions with previously unattainable flexibility and reliability.

The unique combination of in situ thin film growth and low temperature
              electrical measurement will open the door for many research opportunities in
              the long run, as the apparatus will be sited at MARTECH, the Center for
              Materials Research and Technology, which is funded by the state of Florida and
              located at FSU.  The setup will provide researchers at FSU and surrounding
              institutions, especially Florida A & M University, with convenient access to
              ultralow temperature for more routine low temperature measurements such as
              tunneling and magneto-transport studies.
