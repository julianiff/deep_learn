Abstract    :
                                        06/16/98    Recent advances in instrumentation now
              enable the use of  fluorescence techniques for applications that previously 
              required radioactive isotopes.  Specific application  examples include cell
              proliferation assays, assays for  intracellular second messengers such a cyclic
              adenosine  monophosphate (cAMP), and dynamic measurement of  intracellular
              calcium activity.  The principal investigators  propose to purchase a CytoFluor
              Series 4000 multi-well  fluorescence microplate reader to reduce the need for 
              radioisotopes in teaching and research, to train students in  the application
              of up-to-date fluorescence-based techniques,  and to enhance student and
              faculty research in the  department of Biology.  The projects to be supported
              include  research investigating immunology, neurobiology,  invertebrate
              reproduction, and microbiology.
