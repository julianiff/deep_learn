Abstract    :
              EIA-9871443  LeBlanc, James P.  Jedlicka, Russ  New Mexico State University   
              MRI: Development of WISTE: Wireless Indoor Space-Time Environment    The
              objective is to develop and operate a wireless indoor environment within New
              Mexico State University's electrical engineering building which is capable of
              measuring and statistically quantifying the space-time characteristics of the
              indoor wireless channel.  Such an environment would provide benefit to wireless
              researchers as well as promote interest among university engineering students. 
              To the researchers, the experimental results will provide an ability to infer
              appropriate signal-processing and channel-coding strategies.  The instrumented
              environment will allow assessment of various hypotheses by providing
              measurements and models that help researchers better understand the spatial and
              temporal aspects of the wireless indoor channel.  Measurements and statistical
              models will be made available to researchers nationwide through the Internet. 
              This mechanism allows effective and timely dissemination of needed information
              on wireless communications and networking.  To the university student, the
              environment will promote the graduate research programs due to the equipment's
              visible presence within the EE building and its use in both undergraduate and
              graduate classes.  Furthermore, undergraduate students' participation in
              performing such experiments will provide hands-on experience for those heading
              into industry.
