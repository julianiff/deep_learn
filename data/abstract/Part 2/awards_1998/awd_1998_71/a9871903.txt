Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   Program
              is part of the NSF 98-20 Nanotechnology initiative and supports   research in
              the laboratories of Dr. Chad Mirkin at Northwestern   University. The research
              involves the preparation of nanostructures   consisting of DNA and/or
              nanoparticles, which may be insulators,   semiconductors, or metals, utilizing
              the chemical and physical   characteristics of DNA to control particle
              placement and interparticle   distance in two and three-dimensional materials.
              The ultimate goal of   this program is to control particle composition and
              colloidal   crystallization in the preparation of functional materials based
              upon   hybrid nanostructures. The investigators will develop a theoretical  
              understanding of the optical, structural, and electrical properties of   these
              new nanostructures.  The proposed research is anticipated to allow the
              synthesis of   nanostructures with predetermined physical and chemical
              properties. These   materials may have applications in photocatalysis,
              nonlinear optics,   separations, sensor design, and photonics.
