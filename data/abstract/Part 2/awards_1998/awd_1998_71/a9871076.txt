Abstract    :
              9871076  Klinkhammer  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Oregon State
              University provides specialized laser ablation and nebulizer systems for the
              existing high-resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer at the
              Plasma Spectroscopy Facility of the College of Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences. 
              These systems will be used for study of a variety of topics requiring study of
              trace elements, and emphasizing environmental and marine sciences. The project
              is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Oregon State University
              will provide cost-share support for 30% of total project costs.  ***
