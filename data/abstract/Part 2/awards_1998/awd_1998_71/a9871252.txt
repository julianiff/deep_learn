Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support and under the direction of Dr. Malek
              Adjouadi, Florida International University will purchase a Neuro Scan
              Electrical Signal Imaging ESI-256 Channel EEG/EP system and a smaller interface
              unit, an infrared eye-gaze tracking development system. The ESI-256 is the
              first commercially available EEG and evoked potential (EP) system of its kind.
              It permits simultaneous display of average and raw EEG of all channels and
              post-processing, source localization and co-registration with three-dimensional
              data sets such as MRI. The system includes: an ESI Reader Station with optical
              drive and local area network (LAN) connection to the main ESI system; a Neuro
              Scan STIM System interfaced to ESI for evoked potential and cognitive
              event-related potential testing; a Curry Multimodal Neuro-imaging software for
              integration of EEG/EP measurements with MRI and CT modalities. An infrared
              eye-gaze tracking system from LC Technologies will be interfaced with the
              larger system to allow the consolidation of eye-gaze with brain activities
              associated with readiness potentials.  The goal of the research is to develop
              an alternative form of brain-computer interface which is driven by the signals
              generated naturally by the body. It is particularly important for the large
              number of individuals who are physically limited in their access to computers.
              In the evolution of human - computer interfaces one hopes to approach the point
              where humans could use the signals that animate their normal activities to
              interact with such machines. Though study of voluntary movement commands
              initiated in the inner structures of the brain and through eye movement, Dr.
              Adjouadi and his colleagues will work to develop such a system.     - À- v- +-
