              MRI: Acquisition of Equipment for Research in Image Understanding    This
              proposal centers around research focused on analyzing and interpreting images
              of objects, rigid and flexible, obtained through standard sensors (cameras,
              resonance imaging, radars).  Image understanding relates to the representation
              and analysis of knowledge about complex physical systems.  Recent advances in
              computer technology have enabled researchers to study massive databases using
              sophisticated mathematical models which are more realistic for real life
              applications.  Due to continuous advances in sensing technology, the databases
              to be analyzed and understood are massive, up to several hundred megabytes for
              a typical application.  In addition to computational power, visualization and
              database storage, there is also need for high speed networking among distant
              collaborators and distributed tasking of processing power.  To handle these
              computer requirements, it is proposed to enhance existing resources by adding
              the following equipment: a high-performance Silicon Graphics Onyx2 workstation
              as a central server for database handling and major computing operations, two
              Silicon Graphics Octane workstations, two O2 workstations and accessories such
              as a laser printer, a VCR/monitor head, and a personal computer.
