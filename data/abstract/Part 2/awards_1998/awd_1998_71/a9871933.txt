Abstract    :
              EPS-9871933  Tour  In concert with the Governor's Science and Technology Board's
               recommendation, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the 
              University of South Carolina (USC) has identified nanomaterials as  a thrust
              area for future research in the state.  In light of that  goal, the EPSCoR
              project has immediate and long-range components to  assure that USC will
              develop a sustainable nationally competitive  research effort in nanomaterials
              over the next two years.  These  include:  (1) developing novel methods that
              utilize DNA as a  template, scaffold, or promoter for precisely-defined
              synthetic-  organic/DNA or organometallic/DNA hybrid architectures; (2) precise
               positioning of synthetic components in nanomaterials structures and  networks
              at a size range that is unattainable by modern  lithographic methods; and (3)
              hiring of an internationally  recognized Director for a proposed campus-wide
              Nanomaterials  Initiative.
