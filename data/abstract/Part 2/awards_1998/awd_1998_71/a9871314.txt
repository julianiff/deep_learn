Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Physics and   Materials Engineering
              at The University of Maryland in College Park to   acquire a CCD single crystal
              X-ray diffraction system, a powder X-ray   diffraction system with variable
              temperature stage, and to upgrade an   existing  diffractometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas including the following:
              (1) synthesis, structures and   properties of solid state sulfides, selenides
              and oxysulfides, (2)   insertion studies of transition metals into p-block
              polyanions, (3)   studies of `colossal` magnetoresistance in doped rare-earth
              manganese   perovskites, (4) studies of metal-thiometalate cooperativity in the
                transport of hazardous metals in anoxic ground waters, (5) self-assembled  
              ionophores, and (6) organometallic chemistry and synthetic methods.   The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full
              three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the
              precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule
              and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
