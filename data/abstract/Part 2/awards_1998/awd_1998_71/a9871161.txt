This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, in combination with funds from the Earth Sciences
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program, provides partial support for the
              acquisition of a pool of 400 lightweight portable seismographs, associated
              geophones, shipping cases, field computers, GPS clocks, and frequency counters
              for active source seismic experiments aimed at tomographically imaging the
              structure of the Earth's continental lithosphere.  The instruments to be
              acquired by the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were developed by a
              private company, Refraction Technologies (RefTek),  in collaboration with
              personnel from UTEP, Rice University and the University of  Texas at Dallas. 
              The result has been the RefTek-125, a 2-3 lb. Instrument that operates on 2
              D-cell batteries for up to two days with on board memory capable of 12 hours of
              continuous recording at 2 ms intervals or 48 hours at 8 ms.  They are single
              channel instruments which are primarily suited for 
high frequency active
              source seismic experiments.  The lightweight of the RefTek-125 significantly
              reduces shipping costs, allowing field deployment of greater numbers of
              instruments and to more remote locations than have been economically or
              logistically feasible with the older IRIS-Program for Array Seismic Studies of
              the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) pool of community accessible instruments.
               For high-resolution shallow subsurface imaging, these instruments will also
              allow very dense (ca. 1-10 m separations) array deployments for 3-D
              investigations that can feasibly be carried out with only a single field
              vehicle and for relatively low cost.  In return for future operational and
              management support from IRIS, the RefTek-125 pool of instruments will
              ultimately be available to the broader seismological community through the
              IRIS-PASSCAL program.
