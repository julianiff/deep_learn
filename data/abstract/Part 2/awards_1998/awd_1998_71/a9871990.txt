Abstract    :
              9871990  Huray  High Bandwidth Application Test of the SEPSCoR Network  
              Researchers in the Southeast Partnership to Share Computational  Resources
              (SEPSCoR) will test the capabilities of their networks  and to recommend
              acceptable use policies for the SEPSCoR  institutions under growing multi-media
              applications. Three major  tests will be conducted:  (1) a physical /
              electrical network  quality-of-transmission assessment; (2) a Web-based
              education  application and evaluation system; and (3) variable and mixed forms 
              of high-speed electronic linkages to university resources (e.g.  mixed ISDN and
              IP addressable video communications) for unicasts  and multicasts. Five
              corporate partners that are leaders in  communications and instructional
              technology will participate in the  tests to provide an experience base in the
              use of Web-based multi-  media tools for high bandwidth educational
              applications. The tests  will concentrate on Internet packages that are most
              needed in  education such as teaching courses and testing students by means of 
              CBT with streaming video and downloading of large CD ROM databases.  Authoring
              systems for producing a web-based, asynchronous learning  system will include
              homework problem solving, testing, and  evaluation of the system s
              effectiveness. In collaboration with  their industrial partners, the
              researchers will begin with a  workshop to define the specific Video
              conferencing and Educational  Module production equipment needed for each state
              and to determine  how to measure the existing SEPSCoR network performance under
               sustained, high-demand baud rates.
