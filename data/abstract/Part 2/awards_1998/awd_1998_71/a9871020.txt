Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT     CTS-9871020  Jochen Lauterbach  Purdue University    Title:
              Development of an Imaging FT-IR System for Combinatorial Sciences    Professor
              Jochen Lauterbach will develop an Imaging FT-IR system for high throughput
              screening of materials such as polymers, adsorbed layers on catalysts, and
              solid state restructuring during reaction.  The goals are to achieve a system
              capable of imaging a 75 mm x 75 mm field of view, determine trends in
              structure-property relations within a combinatorial library, develop response
              speed sufficient for in situ measurement of chemical reaction-induced changes
              in a large library of compounds. The instrument development will be carried out
              in the Chemical Engineering Department. Purdue University will cost-share 33%
              of the development.
