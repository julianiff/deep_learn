This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
              thermal ionization mass spectrometer that will be installed and operated at the
              Field Museum-Chicago.  The instrument will be the only one of its kind in the
              Chicago-northern Illinois area.  The Field Museum and other participating
              institutions that will be using the spectrometer (University of Chicago and
              Northern Illinois University) are committed to providing the remaining funds
              needed to acquire the instrument.  The new thermal ionization mass spectrometer
              will be used in applications focusing on the chronology of the early solar
              system, the weathering of continents, the isotopic evolution of seawater, and
              Se (selenium) isotope systematics for environmental studies.
