Abstract    :
              EIA-9871022  Cooperman, Gene  Kaeli, David R.  Northeastern University    MRI: A
              High-Performance, Low-Cost Testbed for Network-based Research    This work
              involves development of high-performance commodity computing from commodity
              hardware, which opens up possibilities of much wider access to high-performance
              computing.  The premise is that efficient use of network, storage and
              computation resources, and the specification and provision of well defined
              qualities of service, are the critical core technologies.  Further, these
              technologies must keep costs low by not requiring significant modifications in
              commercial hardware or operating systems, and they must not require a
              significant increase in system administration overhead, which would be beyond
              what could be reasonably expected in less technical environments.  The research
              will take place within the new Egan Engineering Research Center at Northeastern
              University.  The investigators on this proposal are from the College of
              Computer Science, the Center for Digital Processing and the Department of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering.  These units have a history of working
              collaboratively and of managing shared resources and all have research place in
              the Egan building in a very close proximity to the location where the proposed
              network will be place.
