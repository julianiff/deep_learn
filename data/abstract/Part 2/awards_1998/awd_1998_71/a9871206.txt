An eight-circle psi diffractometer will be acquired with funds
              from the Major Research Instrumentation program.  This diffractometer will be
              incorporated into the Pacific Northwest Consortium-Collaborative Access Team
              (PNC-CAT) beamline under development at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).  The
              PNC-CAT includes the University of Washington, Simon Fraser University with
              associated Canadian universities, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories. 
              The research to be carried out using this instrument will cover a broad range,
              from very fundamental and theoretical to very applied projects.

The
              diffractometer, to be acquired with funds from the National Science
              Foundation's Major Research Instrumentation program, will be used for
              fundamental experiments on materials science and interfaces, in industrial
              collaborations of vital interest to the economy of the United States, and in
              applications of recently developed techniques to environmentally relevant
              problems.  In addition, 25% of the available time will be set aside in future
              years for non-CAT users of the PNC-CAT beamlines.
