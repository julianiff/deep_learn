The overall objective of the award is to purchase a Polytec
              PSV-200 Scanning Laser Vibrometer (SLV) and to 1) integrate it into existing
              research setups of the investigators, 2) strengthen new collaborative research
              between the PIs, and with other researchers, 3) integrate it into selected
              undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Mechanical and
              Aerospace Engineering at the University, and 4) make the equipment available to
              other researchers at the University.  An SLV measures velocities of a vibrating
              surface by measuring the change in frequency of a laser beam reflected from the
              moving surface.  Physically different from the electro-mechanical principles of
              accelerometers, the SLV offers non-contact measurements, a finer velocity
              resolution, a wider operating dynamic range, and higher linearity in a fully
              automated scanning package with ultra-high optical sensitivity.
