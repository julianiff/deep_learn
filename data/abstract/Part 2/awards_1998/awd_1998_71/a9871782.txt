Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal No:   9871782  Proposal Type:   Nanotechnology Initiative 
              Principal Investigator:  Mark T. Tuominen  Affiliation:   University of
              Massachusetts at Amherst    This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Processes Program of the Division of Chemical and Transport
              Systems.  It is jointly funded through the Division of Chemical and Transport
              Systems, the Division of Design Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation, and
              the Division of Materials Research.  The research will seek to develop simple,
              robust routes to generate functional nanoscopic structures utilizing thin films
              of block copolymers as templates.  A key element in the proposed research is
              the ability to remove one of the blocks in an easy and quantitative manner to
              generate a porous structure with well-defined pore size and shape.    The
              project combines polymer chemistry and chemicals processing with the physics of
              ultra small scale devices to produce functional nanostructures.  A range of
              potential applications exist for these materials, including membranes with well
              defined nanopores, quantum wires with giant magnetoresistance, and organized
              quantum dot structures.
