Abstract    :
                                                       This proposal requests funds for a
              fluorescence-  activated cell sorter (FACS) system. A FACS uses laser 
              technology to examine fluorescently tagged intracellular and  cell surface
              proteins and DNA content of live or fixed  individual cells and to then sort
              cells according to their  fluorescence and/or DNA content. Research that will
              be  supported by the instrument includes: the action of the  molecular
              chaperonin calreticulin; lentivirus-host  interactions; mycoplasm host cell
              receptors; viral  transmission mechanisms; dessication resistance in plants; 
              protein folding by the ER; and hormonal regulation of protein  phosphorylation
              in the ovary.
