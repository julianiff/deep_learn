Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:      CTS-9871156    Principal Investigator:   K.
              Kiger, R. Calabrese, M. Harris    Funds are awarded to purchase a Phase Doppler
              Anemometer and associated instrumenentation.  This will allow the PIs to extned
              and strengthen their research programs and to train graduate students in the
              use of state-of-the-art instrumentation for single and multiphase flow studies.
               The research to be conducted with this instrumentation will focus on the areas
              of electro-precipitation, particle/turbulence interaction, droplet breakup and
              coalescence, and turbulent mixing.  This multipurpose facility will provide a
              reduced learning curve and improved mentoring of new researchers by senior
              graduate students and will broaden the students' technical perspectives.
