Abstract    :
              EIA-9871315  Tzeng, Nian-Feng  University of Southwestern Louisiana    MRI:
              Acquisition of Networked Heterogeneous Computer Systems    This proposal
              pertains to acquisition of networked heterogeneous computer systems, which will
              be dedicated to support research activities pertinent to computer and
              information science and engineering.  This proposed major research
              instrumentation will enable experimental studies essential to three ongoing
              research projects: aggressive distributed shared memory (DSM) implementation;
              effective synchronization mechanism, and recoverable DSM.  It includes desktop
              PCs, an ALR Revolution Server, SUN workstations and a SUN Enterprise server,
              which are interconnected by a Myrinet LAN switch and a fast Ethernet switch
              from 3Com.  The instrumentation will also allow students in computer
              architecture and distributed processing courses to gain hands-on experience,
              stimulating students' interest in computer system research.  Entry-level
              graduate research assistants involved in the on-going research projects will be
              encouraged to take advantage of this instrumentation for realizing aggressive
              research agenda.
