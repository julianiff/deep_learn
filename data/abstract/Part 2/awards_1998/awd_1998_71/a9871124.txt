A multiprocessor computer system for use in modeling and design
              of new materials will be acquired with funding from the Major Research
              Instrumentation program.  Research applications of this equipment include
              simulation of the properties of gels and nanocomposites, modeling of the
              interactions of organic molecules and polymers with surfaces, developing a
              microscopic understanding of solubility in supercritical CO2, developing
              tractable methods for carrying out electronic structure calculations on large
              molecules, and establishing the role of defects and impurities on reactions on
              semiconductor surfaces.

The computer hardware, that will be acquired
              with funds from the National Science Foundation's Major Research
              Instrumentation program, will not only provide five research groups in
              theoretical/computational chemistry and chemical engineering at the University
              of Pittsburgh with a much needed boost in computer power but will also greatly
              foster our efforts in undertaking new interdisciplinary projects among these
              groups and their external collaborators.  The computer hardware will also
              provide students with valuable experience in developing software for parallel
              processing architecture, and will enable the PIs to better exploit the
              massively parallel facilities at the National Supercomputing Centers.
