Abstract    :
                     The objective of this project is to upgrade the current  console of the
              8.5 T Bruker NMR spectrometer at the Center  for NMR Research and Development
              at the University of Alabama  at Birmingham. This spectrometer supports five
              Investigators  known for their research in myocardial bioenergetics and  cation
              homeostasis. Experiments designed to address important  biological questions
              range from continuous measurement of  metabolic variables in intact hearts to
              measurement of tissue  extract samples to structural work on chemical samples.
              The  requested spectrometer upgrade is considered critical for  maintenance of
              research progress of the facility. It will  also be important for educational
              objectives as most of the  research at this facility is performed by graduate
              students  and post-doctoral fellows.
