Abstract    :
              9871955  Engstrom  South Dakota Science and Technology Council  This project
              will establish a South Dakota Science and Technology  Council. The Council s 
              membership will representing higher  education, state government, the private
              sector, and other groups  involved with science, engineering, and mathematics.
              The Council  will have several charges:  (1) identify and coordinate the 
              response to intra- and interstate opportunities in science and  technology; (2)
              coordinate the state s science policy efforts at  the state and federal level;
              (3) provide assistance in intellectual  property and technology transfer; (4)
              contribute to public  awareness and appreciation for the role of science and
              technology;  and (5) serve as a science advisory board to state policy-makers. 
              The Council will be coordinated by an Executive Director, who will  begin work
              in Year 2 of the project. This project will focus on a  planning effort in Year
              1, which includes the formulation of the  Council itself and a search for an
              Executive Director. Year 2 will  begin implementation of the Council s work.
              The planning year will  also examine the optimal long-term arrangement of the
              Council and  its relationship to state government and the private sector.
