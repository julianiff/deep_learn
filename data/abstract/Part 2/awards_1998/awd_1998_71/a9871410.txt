Abstract    :
                9871410  KHOSLA    This award provides funding for education courseware that
              draws upon the research conducted by the former Engineering Research Center at
              Carnegie Mellon University that has now transitioned to the self-sustaining
              Institute for Complex Engineered Systems.  This project will develop two
              Design- Complex courseware that will be accessible on the World Wide Web: 
              DesignComplex on Wearable Computers and DesignComplex on Building Design.  A
              "complex" is an interconnected assemblage of related things.  The
              DesignComplexes will share an underlying collaborative web-based learning
              environment for design problem solving.  The DesignComplexes will include
              web-based open-ended multidisciplinary design projects, design and analysis
              tools, communication and information structuring tools for student design teams
              and faculty, instructional material for faculty to guide them in the use of the
              courseware, and a variety of evaluation methods to be used by students,
              faculty, and developers.  Each DesignComplexes will have different modules
              appropriate for first year students through graduate students.  At successive
              levels, simplifying assumptions can be removed and factors such as business or
              ethical concerns may be added.  The project plan includes the development,
              testing, evaluation, and dissemination of the DesignComplexes.
