An increased emphasis for research and education in optical
              spectroscopy at this undergraduate institution will be created through
              acquisition of spectroscopic instrumentation for faculty research and
              undergraduate student use.  The equipment includes an optical spectrometer, an
              FTIR instrument, and a pulsed Nd:YAG pumped tunable optical parametric
              oscillator system.  In addition, a fiber optic network will be installed in the
              department to increase access to new and existing laser systems.  This project
              is supported through the Major Research Instrumentation Program.
