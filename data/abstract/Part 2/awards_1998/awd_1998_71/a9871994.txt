This is theoretical and experimental research on
              electro-osmosis in membranes in the outer hair cell lateral wall in the
              mammalian inner ear.  The investigators claim that the outer hair cell can be
              regarded as a naturally occurring microelectromechanical (MEM) system, in which
              voltages induce fluid transport through the 33 nm wide extracisternal space.  A
              set of differential equations has been developed to model the coupling between
              electrostatic potentials and fluid flow in the system.  They will use this
              model to predict the effects of applied voltages on fluid transport under a
              variety of conditions.  These predictions will be tested experimentally through
              optical measurements of the displacement of fluorescent molecules within the
              extracisternal space.  The goal is to derive general principles about the
              interaction between voltages and fluid flow in nanostructures, which can be
              exploited in artificial MEM systems.
