Abstract    :
                   This is a request for instrumentation to provide state of  the art
              MALDI-TOF and liquid chromatography-electrospray mass  spectrometric methods to
              the St. Paul Campus of the University  of Minnesota. The recent advances in
              mass spectrometry for  biological molecule analysis have been extreme, and this
               instrumentation represents the components necessary to take  advantage of
              these advances. The instrumentation will be  placed in an existing facility and
              will be maintained by  existing personnel. Thirteen projects are described as 
              examples of the anticipated usage. These projects fall into  four categories
              including; support for other core facilities  at the university, such as the
              microchemical facility;  projects targeting small molecules and unusual
              biomaterials;  projects involving proteins and peptides of all sizes; and 
              finally projects involving the identification of protein  components in large
              complexes and mixtures. These technologies  will be available on a broader
              basis for researchers and  educators in other institutions in the region.
