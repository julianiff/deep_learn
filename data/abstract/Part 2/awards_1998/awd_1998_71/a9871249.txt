Abstract    :
              Abstract  Varghese      Funds are awarded to develop a new laser velocimeter
              that allows continuous measurement of velocity at rates ranging from 10-100
              kHz.  The instrument will utilize a novel variation on filtered Rayleigh
              scattering called Modulated Filtered Rayleigh Scattering.  This velocimeter
              will be an improvement on typical laser doppler velocimetry because of the
              following features:  only a single beam is required, rather than two beams, by
              viewing in opposite directions, two components of velocity can be measured
              using a single laser beam; velocity measurements every 20 microseconds are
              feasible; multi-point measurements can be made; measurement sensitivity can be
              maximized without optical realignment; measurements will be possible in
              luminous and sooting flames; measurements can be made in unseeded flows.  The
              system will make flow-mapping studies more efficient than current LDV methods.
