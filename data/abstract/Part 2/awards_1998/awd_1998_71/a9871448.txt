Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:      CTS-9871448    Principal Investigator:     
              R. Blackwelder, F. Browand      Funds are awarded to assemble a wind tunnel
              containing a moving ground plane test section.  This wind tunnel will be used
              to train undergraduate students in required and elective courses and to study
              the aerodynamics of road vehicles used in transportation and commerce.  The
              flow field around these vehicles, particularly trucks, is more complex and less
              understood than the flow fields around airplanes and other aerodynamic bodies. 
              Potential fuel savings from improved aerodynamics efficiencies as well as
              benefits from decreased levels of pollution are many times greater for ground
              vehicles in comparison to aircraft because of the larger number of vehicle
              involved.
