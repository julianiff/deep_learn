Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mark Gabel and Black Hills State
              College will purchase a JEOL variable-vacuum scanning electron microscope and
              energy dispersive X-Ray Spectometer. The system can operate at both low vacuum
              and high vacuum pressures, providing high resolution @ 3.5 nm. at 30kV for high
              vacuum and @ 5.5mn at 30kV in low vacuum mode. The options permit high
              resolution images over a wide range of magnifications and voltages which allows
              examination of specimens which may be difficult to observe under normal
              operating conditions due to problems with low conductivity or water content or
              with borrowed specimens which can not be coated. Black Hills State College
              currently employs a 17 year old microscope which is rapidly nearing the end of
              its useful life.  Investigators at the College will pursue a wide range of
              research and the microscope X-Ray Spectometer system will be used in a variety
              of projects. These include: examination of Miocene plant fossils from North and
              South America; evaluation of the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced cement
              and alkali-carbonate and alkali-silica reactivity in concrete pavements;
              comparison of tooth morphologies from Late Cretaceous Theropods; examination of
              seasonal diets of livestock, wildlife and insects in prairie ecosystems and
              woodlands; study of infections of the fungus Saprolegnia on Chinook Salmon;
              identification of use wear on lithic and bone tools from archaeological sites;
              the development of taste bud morphology and gustatory pathways in the brains of
              fishes; and the examination of Ascospores of Phyllachora. Undergraduates will
              be involved with many of these projects and thus the instrumentation will serve
              an important educational function.
