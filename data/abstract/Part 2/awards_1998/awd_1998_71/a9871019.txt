Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr David Willer will design `ExNet
              (Experimental Network) III, a multipurpose instrument for experimental
              investigation in the social sciences. Based at two sites within the University
              of South Carolina at Columbia, the system will permit 60 participants to
              interact in highly controlled situations. A primary underlying objective of the
              computer system hardware provided through this award is to develop a `Web-Lab`
              and to accomplish this goal ExNet III's software will be placed on the Web as
              shareware. Once on the Web, ExNet III will run experiments both at South
              Carolina as well as other laboratories nationally and internationally. ExNet
              III will be constructed using modular programming architecture for experimental
              designs that can be used as building blocks for an array of future studies. By
              standardizing data recording, the system will archive new research
              automatically and also facilitate the archiving of previous research. The
              resulting large systematic databases, being public, will encourage an array of
              new analyses, including hopefully the development of new theory using
              computational approaches.  At South Carolina, the laboratory will support
              research in sociology, economics and accounting. These involve network exchange
              theory, models of human decision making, bargaining behavior, public good
              provision and auction bidding strategies. The laboratory will be widely used by
              graduate students and play an important role in student education.
