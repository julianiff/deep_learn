Abstract    :
              9871388  McPherson    This grant, made through the Major Research
              Instrumentation  (MRI) program provides over 50% of funds necessary to  acquire
              a computer system sufficient and necessary for  performing specialized
              hydrogeologic and geophysical  research.  Specifically, the advanced computer
              system is  required for analysis of extremely large, time-dependent  data sets,
              performing model simulations using such data  sets, and 3-D visualization and
              animation of results.  New  Mexico Tech Hydrology and Geophysics faculty and
              students  will use the new computers in both teaching and research.  Research
              projects that will use the new computer system lie  within ten research focus
              areas:  (1) aquifer heterogeneity  and spatial variability, (2) vadose zone
              hydrology,  groundwater recharge, semiarid region soils and  geomorphology and
              their relationship to ecology, (3) basin-  scale hydrogeology, (4)
              environmental contamination and  remediation, (5) land surface-atmosphere
              interactions,  paleoclimatology and paleohydrology, (6) investigation of 
              crustal structure and earthquake source processes using  microearthquakes and
              teleseismicity, (7) volcanic  seismology, (8) numerical modeling of seismic
              wave  generation and propagation, (9) experimental and theoretical  study of
              rock and sediment physical properties and  acoustics, and (10) high resolution
              seismic  reflection/refraction studies.  The system to be acquired  includes a
              high capacity, multi-processor server capable of  handling extremely large data
              sets and performing numerical  model simulations requiring such data sets.  The
              system also  includes 8 advanced workstations capable of state-of-the-art  3-D
              visualization and animation.  ***
