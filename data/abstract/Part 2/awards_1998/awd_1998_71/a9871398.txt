	Understanding of the physics of clouds and precipitation is
              necessary in order to address a variety of meteorological problems from rain
              formation through cloud radiative properties which are important to many issues
              on climate and global climate change.  The Principal Investigators will develop
              an advanced suite of airborne instrumentation that will allow better data
              collection than heretofore possible on the water budget of cloud systems.  This
              set of instruments has been named the Active-passive Millimeter wave Remote
              Sensing system (AMRS).  The completed system will be comprised of a cloud
              profiling radar (transmit frequency of  95 GHz) and two (20.6 and 31.6 GHz)
              radiometers.  AMRS will be mounted on the University of Wyoming's KingAir
              national aircraft facility and used principally for fundamental cloud physics
              research.  Together with an existing extensive set of in situ probes, the
              proposed ARMS will substantially add to the King Air's research
              capabilities.
The 95 GHz cloud profiling radar component has already been
              developed under prior support.  This unique system has enabled numerous
              significant research findings about the structure and dynamics of clouds, which
              are now in the literature.  Under the current grant, the Principal
              Investigators will develop the two radiometers.  The combined use of the of
              AMRS sensors will represent a significant increase in capabilities for
              understanding cloud microphysics and dynamics and will help address fundamental
              problems that range from precipitation production to impact of clouds on
              climate.
