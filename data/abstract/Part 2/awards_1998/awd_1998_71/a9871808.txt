Abstract    :
              9871808  Koseff    The project is for a laboratory study of internal-wave
              breaking.  It is proposed to create a wave-breaking  event at the interface of
              a two-layer stratified system, with the purpose of 1) measuring the mixing 
              efficiency of the breaking and the resulting turbulence, and 2) characterizing
              the fine-scale physical  processes associated with the breaking.  Three sets of
              experiments will be carried out:  The first two  sets will concentrate on
              visualization of the breaking process, and DPTV will be used in the third set
              to  study the physics and fine-scale structure of the breaking event and the
              resulting turbulence.
