              Hill    MRI: Acquisition of a Graphics Supercomputer for Synthetic Environments
              Service Science and Engineering    The proposed instrument is a
              state-of-the-art real-time graphics computer, a Silicon Graphics Reality
              Monster.  This machine intimately combines eight high-performance graphics
              rendering pipelines with 32 conventional RISC processors.  This instrument will
              accelerate research on real-time synthetic-environments applications in science
              and engineering.  The principal projects set forth in this proposal are those
              for which both the exceptional graphics power and the intimately coupled
              high-performance computing power are crucial for enabling otherwise impossible
              research advances in the next three years.  The projects include: rendering
              images of the world at nanometer scales as data come from atomic-force
              microscopes; augmented reality for applications such as giving the surgeon a
              view into the body using the images from inside the body, through a
              laparoscope; rendering massive models of complex man-made structures, such as
              ships and factories, for interactive walkthroughs to examine structures and
              make design decisions; rendering directly from multiple images of remote
              real-world scenes as well as from traditional geometric models; rapidly
              rendering to large, multi-megapixel displays either head-mounted or covering
              the walls; tracking outdoors for augmented reality.
