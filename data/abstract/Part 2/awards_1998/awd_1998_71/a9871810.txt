This work is an interdisciplinary investigation of
              nano-scale electronics in the limit that devices and circuit elements approach
              the size of, and may actually be, large molecules.  The building blocks of
              molecular electronics, memory, interconnects, and transistors, will be
              explored.  The research is funded through the Partnership in Nanotechnology,
              with support being provided by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research
              in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorate, the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and the Division of
              Chemical and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate.
