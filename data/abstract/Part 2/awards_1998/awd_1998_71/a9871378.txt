Abstract    :
              9871378  Keppel  The goal of this research is to develop and test a portable 
              nuclear emission detection and imaging device with medical  and non-medical
              applications. This device will have high  sensitivity detection capability for
              beta, gamma and beta  plus gamma radiation. This research will focus on
              developing  and optimizing various probe designs and the photo detector.  The
              goal is a customized system with compact system  components, which is simple to
              use. This research is a  collaboration between Hampton University, the Duke 
              University Medical Center and the Thomas Jefferson National  Accelerator
              Facility.  ***
