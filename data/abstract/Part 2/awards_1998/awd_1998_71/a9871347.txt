Abstract    :
                     This application requests funds for an intermediate voltage cryo- 
              electron microscope for the imaging of biological molecules and  macromolecular
              assemblies. This instrument, with its 500-1000-fold  increased brightness over
              other available microscopes enables  operation in a high-coherence mode that
              virtually eliminates the  damping of the contrast transfer function at high
              resolutions, and  greatly enhances the resolution to which images can be made.
              The  microscope will be used for studies that include the structure of 
              prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes; mitochondrial outer membrane  pore;
              skeletal fast twitch calcium release channel; and cytoplasmic  dynein motion.
              For all these projects this microscope will produce  significantly improved
              images, providing a much more highly detailed  vision of the structures of
              these biological systems.
