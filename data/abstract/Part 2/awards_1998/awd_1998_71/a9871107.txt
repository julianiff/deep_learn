              ABSTRACT     CTS-9871107  Sharmila M. Mukhopadhyay, Roger K. Gilpin, Isaac
              Weiss, Raghavan Srinivasan  Wright State University    Title: Acquisition of
              Ultra-High Vacuum Photoelectron Spectroscopy Facility    Wright State
              University will purchase an x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system with high
              spectral and spatial resolution. The facility will be made available to
              University of Dayton, industrial collaborators, Wright Laboratory, and the
              Center for Sensor Materials of Michigan State University. Wright State
              University will cost-share 50% of the instrument. The XPS will be used in
              projects related to high temperature electronics materials, interfacial
              modification of electroceramics, solid lubricant films, titanium aluminides for
              automotive applications, silica-carbon hybrids with controllable interfacial
              structure, pyrolysis and oxidative pyrolysis of chlorinated
              chloro-hydrocarbons, ceramic whiskers and fibers, and laminates and composite
              films.
