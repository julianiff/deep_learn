Abstract    :
              EIA-9871133  Seidel, Steven R.  Freidrich, Craig R.  Michigan Technological
              University    MRI: Acquisition of Computational Facilities for Michigan Tech's
              Computational Science and Engineering Program    In this project the
              Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E) will share a new computational
              facility to advance research in their individual fields, to provide
              interdisciplinary training in computationally intensive methods and to offer
              instruction to CS&E students and to students in other graduate degree programs.
               The computational equipment acquired in this project will also be available
              for use in the summer programs Michigan Technological University provides for
              women and minorities.  The proposed computational facility consists of a Sun
              Microsystems HPC 6000 Server with 8 processors, over 2 gigabytes of memory and
              1000 gigabytes of disk storage, network connection hardware to assure high
              speed accessibility to all users, and software to support scientific and
              engineering computation.  The processors in this system can be used as
              stand-alone, high performance computer engines or together as a parallel
              computer.  This computational system will run all the software systems and
              codes developed for the Sun systems on campus, so users will be able to make
              immediate use of the new facility.
