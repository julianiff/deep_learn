Abstract    :
              9871855  Donelan    The project is to conduct an analysis of direct eddy 
              correlation estimates of carbon dioxide and water vapor  fluxes from a mobile
              platform.  In addition, ancillary data  will be analyzed including:  wind
              stress and heat flux, wave  directional spectra and mean square slope, profile
              of  kinetic energy dissipation and video images of wave  breaking.  The final
              task will be the interpretation and  reporting of this data set of the first
              offshore direct  measurements of the carbon dioxide flux.
