Abstract    :
              9871974  Nichols  Construction of High-Speed Research Network in Nevada   The
              University and Community College System of Nevada  (UCCSN), in conjunction with
              its three major research  institutions, will develop the Nevada Research
              Network  (NRN). This network will support a number of scientific  research
              applications that require high bandwidth and  quality of service features. The
              NRN is specified as an in-  state research-only network based on ATM over OC3
              (fiber  optic) which will serve the University of Nevada, Las Vegas  (UNLV),
              the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), and the Las  Vegas and Reno campuses of
              the Desert Research Institute  (DRI). Five facilities and thirteen departments
              of these  three institutions will be connected initially to the NRN.  This
              high-speed connectivity will also provide the  researchers at these three
              Internet 2 institutions with the  opportunity to take full advantage of the
              National  Supercomputing Alliance with EPSCoR states. The design of  the NRN
              will provide for the cost-effective use of one or  more very-high-speed
              backbone network system connections.  The NRN consists of star topology network
              OC3 connections  originating at the Reno and Las Vegas offices of the UCCSN s 
              Systems Computing Services. Existing network infrastructures  and Internet
              Protocol distribution systems of the three  institutions and UCCSN supply
              service to designated  departments. An OC3 line between the two SCS offices 
              provides a north-south state backbone. An advisory  committee, consisting of
              representatives from each of the  participating organizations, will oversee
              implementation and  will be responsible for developing NRN access and use 
              policies.
