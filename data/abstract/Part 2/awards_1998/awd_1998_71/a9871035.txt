Abstract    :
              9871035  Donahue    This award provides 65% of the funding required for the
              acquisition  and installation of an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) to be 
              housed and operated by the University of Arizona's NSF-Arizona AMS  facility.
              The University of Arizona is committed to providing the  remaining 35% needed
              for the acquisition and installation. The  NSF-Arizona AMS serves as an
              education-oriented multi-user  facility, providing radiocarbon dates and
              analyses for the basic  research community in a variety of fields including
              earth sciences,  ocean sciences, atmospheric sciences, anthropology, and
              archeology.  The new accelerator system replaces one that is approaching 
              20-years of service.  ***
