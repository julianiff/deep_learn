Abstract    :
                 Augustana College in Sioux Falls, SD requests funds for the  acquisition of
              DNA analysis instrumentation in support of  research and research training in
              the Biological Sciences.  The research programs described in this proposal will
              allow  undergraduates to explore significant questions in  host/herpesvirus
              interactions, plant genome organization,  wheat gluten expression and the
              relationship between obesity  and fertility in mice while gaining experience
              with  sophisticated, state-of-the art instruments.    A high-quality
              undergraduate research experience is a key  component of the Augustana Biology
              curriculum, which  emphasizes the process of scientific thought and the 
              development of critical thinking skills. The combination of a  vigorous
              undergraduate research program and state-of-the-art  instrumentation will
              continue to attract students, about two-  thirds of which are women, to Biology
              and to Augustana  College. As one of the few private, liberal arts colleges in 
              South Dakota, it is vital that Augustana remains competitive  with the
              institutions in the state of South Dakota and with  similar liberal arts
              institutions across the region.
