This actions is in response to the Major Research
              Instrumentation Initiative MRI'98 (NSF98-16).  This action is to support the
              acquisition and development of unique materials testing equipment that would be
              used to characterize micro-mechanical behavior of granular media and
              computational facilities to be used for the development and implementation of
              constitutive models to describe material behavior, and numerical models to
              solve boundary-value problems.  

The research equipment consists of a load
              device with a specimen and environmental chamber to be designed for use inside
              a recently purchased Digital Radiography-Computer tomography (DR/CT) scanner. 
              Operation of this device permits DR/CT scans to be taken during loading of
              granular specimens, thereby allowing imaging of microstructural material
              transformations on the granular scale during the deformation process, leading
              to an understanding of deformation processes and failure mechanisms in various
              engineering materials where internal structural changes are important.  The
              computational equipment consists of a workstation for the development and
              implementation of constitutive models.  

This research and computational
              equipment will be shared by two research groups in the Department of Civil
              Engineering; whose focus is on the mechanical and thermodynamic behavior of
              granular materials.  The cold regions group addresses snow and ice materials
              while the geotechnical group concentrates on soil and geosynthetic materials.
