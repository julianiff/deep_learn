              Acquisition of a Scalable Parallel Supercomputer for the Science Vision Center 
                This proposal requests the acquisition of a scalable parallel supercomputer
              that will provide the computational power to handle the scientific computing
              requirement of researchers at the Science Vision Center.  The specific
              equipment requested is a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 Scalable Parallel server
              with four R10000 processors, 1 gigabyte of memory, and 18 gigabytes of disk
              storage.  This powerful system is expected to deliver at least 10-fold
              improvement in performance over the conventional workstations on which most of
              the applications are currently being run. This proposal also requests four
              Silicon Graphics 02 client workstations, which will be used primarily for
              applications development, debugging, and data visualization.  Together with
              equipment already on hand, the parallel server and client workstations will be
              set up as a network, which will also serve as the testbed for the
              High-performance Distributed Object Programming Environment Project.  The goal
              of this project is to design a CORBA-based parallel/distributed programming
              environment that will harness the combined power of the parallel server and the
              workstations to solve large scale parallel applications.
