Abstract    :
                     The overall objective of this Major Research  Instrumentation proposal is
              to create a science and  technology infrastructure that fosters the development
              and  integration of functional genomics and information  technology at Texas
              A&M University (TAMU). The requested  cluster of genomics instrumentation will
              automate DNA  library construction, DNA purification, liquid handling, DNA 
              sequencing and genetic marker analysis. The infrastructure  will support NSF's
              Plant Genome Program, an A. nidulans  genome sequencing project recently
              started in collaboration  with industry at Texas A&M University, and a growing
              number  of research and teaching activities in the area of genomics.  In
              addition, the instrumentation will accelerate progress on  the construction of
              integrated genetic and physical maps for  numerous organisms, provide access to
              DNA microarray  technology for analysis of whole genome expression, and 
              facilitate studies of gene expression in differentiated  cells. The requested
              instrumentation will also provide tools  required to integrate the power of
              genomics, GIS, and remote  sensing for the study of plant function in natural
              micro-  environments.       Genome projects are generating tremendous amounts
              of  new DNA sequence information and creating novel tools, such  as DNA chip
              technology, for genome wide analysis of gene  function. In 1996, the sequences
              of several bacterial  genomes and the yeast genome were completed. For plants,
              the  A. thaliana genome (120 Mbp) is scheduled for completion by  2000 and a
              rice genome project is being planned as pan of  NSF's Plant Genome Program.
              Even more impressive is the  scheduled completion of the 3,000 Mbp human genome
              by 2005.  The rate of DNA sequence information generation currently  surpasses
              the scientific community's capacity for  utilization. A surprising 30% or more
              of the genes  discovered in the sequencing efforts currently have no known 
              function. Therefore, one overall goal of this proposal is to  develop an
              infrastructure t hat connects gene discovery  through sequencing to the
              analysis of gene function at  molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal
              levels.
