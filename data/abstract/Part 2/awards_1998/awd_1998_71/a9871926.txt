Abstract    :
              9871926  Cooper  West Virginia University/Industrial Research and Education 
              Partnership for Improving High-Temperature Structural Alloys   This project
              will initiate the West Virginia University/Industrial  Research and Education
              Partnership for Improving High-Temperature  Structural Alloys. High-strength
              superalloys are the backbone of  machinery such as aircraft engines and
              advanced gas turbines for  electrical power production.  The partnership,
              formed in 1997,  established a steering committee, chaired by Dr. James
              Williams of  G.E. Aircraft Engines. Besides Dr. Williams, the steering
              committee  membership includes representatives of the University of West 
              Virginia, Allison Engine Corporation, GE Power Generation, INCO  Alloys
              International, Furrer-Ladish Co., Special Metals  Corporation, and Carpenter
              Technology. The committee will work to  facilitate sharing of R&D expertise and
              knowledge at the companies  and with the interdisciplinary
              experimental/computational-modeling  team that has been established at the
              University of West Virginia.  The steering committee has identified critical
              challenges in the  area of high-temperature structural alloys, and the company 
              representatives endorsed the research efforts of the University R&D  team in
              addressing these challenges. The project will support  necessary organizational
              and educational steps necessary to advance  the agreed-on priority research to
              a stage where long-range federal  and private sector funding can be obtained.
