Abstract    :
                Abstract - CTS-9871292 - Datye - Papiki - Xu  Professors Abhaya K. Datye and
              James J. Papiki, and Dr. Huifang Xu, of the U. of New Mexico, will acquire a
              JEOL Model 2010 200 keV field emission gun combination transmission electron
              microscope and scanning transmission electron microscope (FEG-TEM-STEM) for
              nanostructured materials and earth sciences research. The new FEG-TEM-STEM will
              yield elemental analysis (by energy-dispersion and electron-energy loss
              spectroscopies) and novel imaging (by Z-contrast and electron holography) of
              materials at the sub-nanometer scale. Such resolution is essential for
              advancing the knowledge of nanostructured materials, their chemistry and
              physics, and their role in earth sciences and a multiplicity of modern
              technologies. The FEG-TEM-STEM will be the top-of-the-line instrument in an
              existing microscopy laboratory which includes an electron microprobe, a
              scanning electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer, and a suite of sample
              preparation equipment. The laboratory will provide research access to multiple
              investigators at U. N. M., and to faculty of N. M. Highlands U. and N. M. Inst.
              Mining and Technology, involving the departments of Chemical and Nuclear
              Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Earth and Planetary Sciences,
              and Biology. It will also provide hands-on microscopy instruction to students.
