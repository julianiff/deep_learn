Abstract    :
              9871120  Edson  This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution supports the development of a Nearshore Observatory
              for study of physical, biological, geological and chemical processes in the
              coastal zone near Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.  It will include a
              permanent station in 10 meters water depth outfitted with a variety of
              oceanographic sensors, as well as a satellite node in shallower water and a
              meteorological tower on the adjacent island.  The synoptic set of data from all
              sensors will be available in real time to researchers via fiber optic cable
              connection and the World Wide Web.  Additional sensors and experiments may be
              added for specific projects, providing capabilities to run controlled studies
              in a well parameterized setting.  The observatory is expected to be used for a
              wide array of studies, including biological recruitment and population
              research, air-sea-bottom interaction study, and investigation into gas transfer
              and aerosol physics.  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will provide
              cost-share support for at least 30% of total project costs.  ***
