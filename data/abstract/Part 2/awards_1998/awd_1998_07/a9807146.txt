Abstract    :
              This project is to explore the use of a family of monooxygenases for the
              production of chiral chemicals without using harsh organics, for the production
              of methanol, and for the remediation of chlorinated aliphatics using a novel
              rhizoremediation process.  An optimized family of monooxygenases is to be
              created using a DNA shuffling technique.  These monooxygenases are to be
              specifically designed for the degradation of trichloroethylene, the formation
              of methanol, and for the synthesis of chiral compounds such as styrene epoxide
              and alpha-naphthol.  An innovative and powerful selection technique is to be
              used to isolate the engineered proteins.
