Abstract    :
              9807141  Yochelson  Council on Competitiveness    This award will provide
              partial support for the National Innovation Summit to be held at Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology, March 12-13, 1998, and a congressional outreach
              program with regional follow-up meetings.  The summit will serve as a forum for
              focusing the findings and recommendations from over five hundred public and
              private sector leaders on the strengths and vulnerabilities of the U.S.
              innovation system.  A particular highlight will be the first-ever benchmarking
              of the innovation process, and progress made by developing nations in
              transitioning from imitator to innovator.    It is expected that some of the
              key issues that have been inadequately considered in previous policy debates on
              innovation will be addressed in this forum, including:  (i) a clear
              understanding, in economic terms, why the capacity for innovation is critical
              to future U.S. competitiveness; and (ii) a realization that the national
              capacity for innovation must be nurtured using a total systems approach.
