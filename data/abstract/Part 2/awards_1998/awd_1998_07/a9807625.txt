Abstract    :
              Anderson is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to  
              continue his studies of reactions of small polyatomic ions containing   from
              three to about fifteen atoms by mode-selected differential   scattering
              methods, using a high-resolution guided-ion beam scattering   instrument.  The
              goal is both to probe detailed reaction mechanisms for   these complex systems,
              and to provide insight into the effects of   different types of reactant
              nuclear motion on chemical reactivity.    Mass-analyzed threshold ionization
              (MATI) and multiphoton ionization   (MPI) will be used to develop routes to
              prepare vibrationally   mode-selected reactant ions, and then to carry out
              experiments with these   ions.  The information gained from these studies will
              advance the   understanding of reaction dynamics in complex systems, and thus
              may aid   in developing approaches to optimize chemical reactions.  When ions
              and molecules collide with one another, changes in their   chemical bonding
              arrangement can occur under certain circumstances.    These studies seek to
              improve the detailed understanding of how internal   molecular motions affect
              the outcomes of collisions in which bonding   changes occur.  Such knowledge is
              central to attaining useful insights   about the nature of chemical change.
