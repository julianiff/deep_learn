              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998.   
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of animal behavior
              and population biology.  The research and  training plan is entitled ecological
              and genetic dissection  of social behavior in the mound building mouse.  A
              breeding  colony of Mus spicilegus is being established to make it  possible to
              study the inheritance of behavior in this and  related species.  Field work is
              being conducted to study the  ecological and social components of the behaviors
              under  study.
