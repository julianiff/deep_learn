Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at Emory
              University will study the different experience by race of women afflicted with
              systematic Lupus erythematosus in Atlanta, GA.   In the US, African-American
              women are affected by SLE at twice the rate of white women, and experience
              diagnosis delays that contribute to excess morbidity and mortality.  The
              project will study the complex processes that contribute to this delayed
              diagnosis among African-American women.  Relying on a sociocultural model of
              the medical behaviors involved, the student will test hypotheses which explain
              the differential in delayed diagnosis by ethnicity in three areas:
              doctor-patient relationships, differential expressions of pain and suffering,
              and social network/support resources.  The methods include structured and
              semi-structured interviews, psychosocial instrument assessments, individual
              case studies, and intensive observation of clinical encounters, support group
              meetings and social relationships.  This research is important because it will
              advance our understanding of racial differences in doctor-patient
              relationships, and will contribute to understanding the obstacles facing
              chronic disease sufferers. This new knowledge will be useful to biomedical
              practioners interested in improving their relationships with their patients,
              and to public health professionals interested in designing education programs
              for women with SLE and their families, or larger media campaigns concerning
              societal attitudes towards chronic illness.
