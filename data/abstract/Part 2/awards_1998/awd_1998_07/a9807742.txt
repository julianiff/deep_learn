Abstract    :
              International Workshop on Accurate Solution of Eigenvalue  Problems, July
              20--23, 1998, Pennsylvania State University,  University Park, PA.    The
              purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts for  reviewing current
              research and discussing future research  directions concerning accuracy issues
              in the numerical solution  of eigenvalue problems.  The workshop will provide
              an opportunity  for exchange of ideas to researchers investigating eigenvalue 
              problems for structured matrices and those investigating pseudo-  eigenvalues
              for nonsymmetric matrices.
