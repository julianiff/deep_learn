Abstract    :
              Abstract  OPP-9807521  van der Veen      One of the major challenges in
              glaciology is to develop scenarios for the future evolution of polar ice
              sheets. This effort requires accurately measuring the current mass balance of
              the major ice sheets and an understanding of the causes of any imbalances. In
              this study, two-dimensional flow models will be developed and tested to aid in
              the interpretation of the mass balance results. The objective is to make
              interpretations of mass-balance results for the ice sheet if it should accrete,
              recede, or remain the same. Each of these scenarios for mass imbalance will be
              modeled so that the sensitivity of model predictions to parameter variations
              can be readily evaluated. The models will be applied to the Petermann and
              Humboldt glaciers in northwest Greenland, for which a suite of data is
              available that can be used to test and validate the models. An eight hundred
              year old ice core record will be used to help obtain a high-resolution climate
              record for the region. Existing data over the Petermann and Humboldt glaciers
              and their catchment basins will be analyzed to better understand glacier
              dynamics. The Petermann glacier is the main outlet glacier in northern
              Greenland, but very little is known about the dynamics of this fast-moving
              glacier. The lower 60 km is floating and appears to be moving unimpeded through
              the fjord. Above the grounding line, there is a marked change in surface
              topography overlying a deep subglacial trench. suggesting a change in flow. The
              longitudinal velocity profile becomes compressive downstream of the grounding
              line, but transverse velocity profiles indicate that lateral drag is not
              important in that region. Recent mapping of the position of the grounding line
              of the Petermann glacier indicates retreat.
