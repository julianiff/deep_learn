The genetic material that is transmitted from gamete to
              zygote and from cell to cell during development contains a combination of
              genetic information in the form of DNA base sequence but also in the form of
              epigenetic information that affects gene expression. One such epigenetic
              phenomenon is parental genomic imprinting which renders maternal and paternal
              chromosomes functionally non-equivalent. Both the mechanism and function of
              genomic imprinting remain poorly characterized. This project utilizes the
              strain-dependent difference in paternal genome modification between the C57BL/6
              and DBA/2 mouse strains to search for the factors responsible for the
              difference in egg phenotype. An analysis of egg phenotypes of the 25 C57BL/6 x
              DBA/2 recombinant inbred mouse strains (2000 nuclear transplantations) revealed
              the chromosomal locations of two modifier loci, to within 8.7 and 5
              centimorgans (cM) on chromosomes 1 and 2. More complete gene mapping studies
              will be done by 1) fine mapping of the modifier locus on chromosome 2 which
              lies within an interval containing many polymorphic markers and for which a
              significant number of recombinant chromosomes exist and 2) to narrow the
              candidate region on chromosome 1 by identifying additional polymorphic markers
              that can be used for further fine mapping at this locus.

Because the
              biochemical and functional properties of imprinting modifiers are unknown,
              genetic systems provide invaluable opportunities for identifying the factors
              that are involved in the process of mammalian genomic imprinting. These studies
              should also improve our understanding of how egg cytoplasm controls nuclear
              reprogramming during normal development. So little is known about the
              fundamental process of genomic imprinting that this study could have an impact
              beyond just locating relevant genes. All cells carry the same DNA in most
              muticellular organisms but how the genes are regulated ultimately defines the
              function of the cell. Some human diseases are being recognized as lacking the
              usual parental genomic imprint and ultimately, these studies have the potential
              to contribute to our understanding of those genetic defects in humans.
