Abstract    :
              Two workshops will serve 40 college faculty who teach upper-division
              experimental physics courses or who may be considering the development of such
              a course.  The program will facilitate the exchange of ideas about advanced
              laboratory experiments in general, and particularly three inexpensive,
              homebuilt (from commercial parts) tunable diode laser experiments:  Turnable
              Diode Laser with Grating Feedback, Doppler-Free Saturated Absorption, and
              Cooling and Trapping of Atoms.    Other experiments will include transmission
              lines (coaxial, waveguide, and optical fiber), transverse and longitudinal mode
              studies of lasers, computer-assisted experimentation, electron spectroscopy,
              radio-frequency spectroscopy, microwave spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy
              (atomic and molecular), and gamma ray spectroscopy.  A total of 17 experiments
              will be in operation during the workshops.  Equipment lists, data, circuit
              diagrams, and helpful hints will be provided to assist in the development of
              similar experiments at the home institutions of the participants.    The PI
              will select a variety of participants that will optimize the learning
              experience for all.  Ideally, about 80% of the individuals would be those who
              are developing an advanced laboratory course, while 20% would already be
              teaching a well-developed laboratory course.  The latter group would be able to
              share valuable information with the developing group.  We specifically urge
              minorities in the physics community to apply for these workshops.
