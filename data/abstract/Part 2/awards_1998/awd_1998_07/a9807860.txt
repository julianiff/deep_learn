Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Wyoming to
              purchase a high performance departmental computer cluster for   research
              involving large scale calculations.  The new computer will be   used in support
              for the following projects: (1) a computational   examination of the reactions
              of organic sulfides and thioketones with   singlet oxygen, (2)
              theoretical/experimental correlations of the small   molecule immunoinorganic
              cytotoxins, (3) electronic structure studies of   adsorbate induced
              reconstruction of metal surfaces, (4) an investigation   of
              fluoroalkylphosphine electronic properties, and (5)computational   studies of
              high energy density organosulfur compounds.  A  network of   fast, modern
              computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing   needs of
              chemistry departments. Such a `computer network` also serves as   a development
              environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,   provides  graphics and
              visualization facilities, and supports research in   state-of-the-art
              applications of parallel processing.
