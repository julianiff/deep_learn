Abstract    :
              Watt  9807609        In  the  proposed support period the PIs will finish
              development  of  a  nearly  completed method for analyzing metabolites of
              glycolysis in  direct  energetic  support of insect flight. The PIs will
              evaluate the  effects  on  flight performance of 10 natural genotypes of a
              gtycolytic: enzyme, PGI, in  the  PIs insect study system, using the PIs
              computerized insect wind tunnel  to  evaluate lift and thrust output, duration
              of peak output, and  duration  of  minimal  flight sustenance as functions of
              genotype, brood,  and  other  relevant  independent variables. The PIs will
              test the same  genotypes  for  their  effects on flight initiation and
              sustenance at the behavioral  level  in  outdoor  cages, with microclimate
              monitoring in the cages to  establish  appropriate  control  of  daily  thermal
              fluctuations.  This  research,  if  successful, will lay the foundation for
              much new progress in the  study  of  adaptive  metabolic  organization  in 
              support  of  animal  locomotion  and  behavior.
