Abstract    :
              Museums are places where national identities are articulated.  This dissertation
              research project by an anthropology student from the University of Chicago will
              study several museums in the state of Israel, to assess the impact of the
              contemporary critique of Israeli founding myths.  Using a mix of ethnographic,
              archival and survey methods, the student will study how Israeli and Palestinian
              museum displays are constructed, and assess the impact of museums on visitors
              through participant observation and a survey, and on a random sample of
              Israelis through a mail survey.  The study will document the construction,
              transmission and reception of exhibits and their meanings as a process created
              in a dialog between museum personnel, volunteer guides and various groups of
              museum visitors, a process embedded in a larger urban, social, religious and
              political structure.  This research will advance our understanding of how
              national identity is created in this case study which involves tension and
              conflict between Israeli and Palestinian cultural institutions.  The in-depth
              case study will serve to advance our general understanding of similar
              situations of cultural conflict about national identities in other parts of the
              world.
