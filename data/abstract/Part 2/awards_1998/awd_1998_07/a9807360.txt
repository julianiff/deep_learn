Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project involves a student of Land Resources from the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying the dynamics of irreversible
              deforestation for maize fields by hunter-gatherers of southwest Madagascar. 
              The project will analyze the processes of disequilibrium which drive the human
              ecosystem from one pattern of relative stability to another, and the impacts of
              this transition on the human-environmental interactions in the arid forest. 
              The study will consider changes in cultural identity, environmental knowledge,
              resource use and cash market participation.  The specific goals are to
              establish the spatial and temporal patterns of land use and deforestation in
              the forest spanning a fifty year historical period, to explore the political,
              economic and historical context of the patterns at the regional, national and
              international levels, to study the interaction of maize cultivation and local
              politics, cultural institutions and resource use.  Methods include participant
              observation, analysis of aerial photographs and satellite imagery, and rapid
              ethnographic rural appraisal.  The project will contribute to ecological
              anthropology theory and methods, to Malagasy ethnography, and to understanding
              of environmental conservation in similar situations throughout the world.
