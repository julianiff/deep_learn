Abstract    :
              9807827  Daleke    The primary goal of this conference is to stimulate the
              interaction of biophysicists and cell biologists who are addressing common
              questions in the three major themes of this meeting: membrane lipid structure
              and dynamics, membrane protein structure and function, and transmembrane
              transport of solutes, proteins, and information.  Underlying these themes is
              the common thread of lipid and protein structure.  Rapid, recent advances in
              the determination of membrane protein structure have provided the background
              for insights into membrane protein function and mechanisms of action.
