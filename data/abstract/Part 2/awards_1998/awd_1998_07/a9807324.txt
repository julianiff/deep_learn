Abstract    :
              9807324  Brown  Reproductive success is central to individual fitness and to
              survival of populations. It has received renewed attention with the increase in
              long-term studies, yet because so few studies last longer than 30 years, much
              remains to be learned about long-term aspects of reproductive success.
              Aphelocoma ultramarina is a species that is well suited for studies of
              long-term patterns of reproduction. It is long-lived, has extremely delayed
              reproduction for a passerine, has probably the most conservative dispersal
              behavior of any North American bird and has already been studies for 29 years.
              This, it provides a rare opportunity to study the role of kinship in dispersal.
              This research will focus on three conceptual areas: 1) Using a natural
              experiment that controls for environmental influences and a new method of
              analysis (nest mate dyads), patterns of dispersal in relation to avoidance of
              close kin and the danger of inbreeding depression will be investigated. 2) The
              expected decline in reproductive success with advanced age will be studies in
              relation to the costs of reproduction and the possible role of helps in
              offsetting costs. 3) Finally, the potential effects of global climate change on
              natural populations will continue to be investigated. In particular, the
              statistical relationships between ENSO events and reproduction with regard to
              yearly variation in precipitation. This study represents an important,
              long-term data set that has implications for understanding how climatic events
              effect fitness over both short and long time scales.
