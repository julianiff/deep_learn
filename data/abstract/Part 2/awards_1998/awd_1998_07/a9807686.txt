ABSTRACT

Baptista, Farrenkopf

The PIs propose to link
              modeling with lab and field results on the transport and speciation of metals
              during episodic disruptions of sediments and in turbidity maxima in estuaries
              and bays.  Central to these studies would be the use of a rotating annular
              flume (RALF) that the PIs would use to control the physical regime over
              incubated sediment cores, which had been collected in the field.  A major
              emphasis would be on the redox cycling of Fe, Mn and associated elements.  The
              field site chosen is the Columbia River estuary, a site where the physical and
              geochemical conditions are suitable to test the proposed hypotheses, and where
              these PIs have preliminary data and ongoing studies.  Overall, the results of
              this interdisciplinary study would significantly advance our ability to
              quantitatively predict the transport, fate and bioavailability of elements in
              estuarine type systems.

This proposal was part of the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry program.  It will be jointly funded by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, and the
              Division of Earth Sciences.
