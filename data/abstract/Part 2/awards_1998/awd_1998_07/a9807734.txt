Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the isolation of bromoperoxidases from   marine
              organisms and the development of methodology for the use of the  
              bromoperoxidases as environmentally benign bromination reagents.  Marine  
              algae, sponges and bacteria will be screened for bromoperoxidases using  
              techniques developed previously for Plocamium cartilagineum and Portieria  
              hornemanni.  The efficacy of the bromoperoxidase as bromination agents   will
              be tested using phenol, methyl salicylate, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol,   geraniol
              and linalool.  The halogenation of alkenes, alkene cyclization,   chiral
              epoxidation and the bromination of heteraromatics, cyclopropanes   and alkynes
              will also be carried out.  Undergraduate students will take   part in all
              phases of the work.  With this Research in Undergraduate   Institutions (RUI)
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program is supporting the
              research efforts of Professors Roy K. Okuda and   Patricia L. Grillione of the
              Department of Chemistry at San Jose State   University.  The focus of the work
              will be to develop synthetic methods   for the use of bromoperoxidases as
              chemoenzymatic reagents for the   environmentally friendly bromination of
              organic compounds.  The work will   be carried out  with the involvement of
              undergraduate students
