Abstract    :
                  Abstract  9807242  Guyden     Thymic nurse cells (TNC) are unique epithelial
              cells in the thymus that internalize immature thymocytes into cytoplasmic
              vacuoles.   This laboratory has established nurse cell lines which will
              internalize immature double positive thymocytes, some of which undergo
              apoptosis, while others are rescued.  The latter mature to single positive
              cells, which are released, suggesting that the nurse cells are important in
              determining the fate of developing thymocytes.  This research is looking at the
              mechanisms by which this occurs.  The  laboratory will try to identify the
              proteins which are involved in the recognition of the thymocytes, and those
              involved in their internalization.   They will examine the events that lead to
              survival versus those that result in cell death.   These investigations will
              provide important information about the mechanisms of development of
              thymocytes.  ***    The mechanism by which immature T cells in thymus develop
              into mature cells is not known.  This laboratory is studying an unusual group
              of thymic cells that can internalize immature T cells and determine whether
              they will mature or die.   These studies are important to our understanding of
              the development of the immune system.
