Abstract    :
                   Successful management and conservation of natural  populations requires
              knowledge of population structure and  migration rates.  The increasing
              availability of extensive  genetic data obtained through relatively
              non-invasive  methods, present new opportunities for monitoring and  management
              at a population level. These markers also make  possible the use of archive
              material.  However, there are  few computational methods available to fully
              exploit  population data.       Methods of Monte Carlo likelihood, using Markov
              chain  Monte Carlo (MCMC) have proven successful on the  evolutionary scale in
              phylogenetic analysis, and on the  individual scale in pedigree analysis.  This
              project  develops a Monte Carlo likelihood approach to inferences  from genetic
              samples taken in monitoring a population over  time.  This will permit
              estimation of the ratio of effective  to actual sizes of breeding populations
              and will also  provide likelihoods for the estimation of admixture or 
              migration structure. The general approach is being developed  on salmonid
              populations, for which there exist both good  data and archive material, and
              the project will result in  software generally applicable for population
              studies  regardless of the study organism.
