Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998. 
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of  biotic surveys
              and inventories.  The research and  training plan is entitled microorganisms in
              carbonate  deposits identified with ribosomal RNA gene sequences  amplified
              directly from environmental samples.  Using PCR,  microbial 16S ribosomal RNA
              genes are being amplified from  environmental samples from carbonate deposits. 
              Phylogenetic  analysis of these rRNA sequences is being used to determine  the
              evolutionary relationships of the principal constituents  of these communities
              with known organisms.  Hybridization  probes will be developed to determine the
              morphology,  abundance and distribution of selected organisms in situ.
