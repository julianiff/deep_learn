Abstract    :
              9807470  Shimizu      In nature, macromolecular self-assembly is nearly an
              ubiquitous  process, yielding complex three- dimensional structures and 
              architectures. Flexible polypeptides and polysaccharides are  folded and
              assembled into materials of exemplary mechanical,  recognition, and catalytic
              properties.  Proposed are three  synthetic polyimides that similarly
              self-assemble into structures  of precise dimensions and organization.  The
              resulting, hexagonal  array, interwoven sheets, and conformational switch are
              unique  due to their nano-scale dimensions, highly organized topologies,  and
              entirely synthetic composition.  As a consequence, novel  biomimetic and
              materials properties are anticipated.  Envisioned  are applications as:  (1)
              models to understand the fundamental  process of biological self-assembly; (2)
              rationally designed  materials such as organic zeolites and conductors; (3)
              materials  with biomimetic properties such as replication, specificity, and 
              templating abilities.  However, the most attractive attribute of  the proposed
              polymers is ease and low cost with which these self-  organizing materials can
              be synthesized.  All three polyimides  are fashioned from a similar framework
              composed of 1, 3-  disubstituted benzenes linked by 1,4,5,8-naphthalene
              diimides.  These synthetic polymers can be prepared by conventional 
              polymerization and processing techniques from inexpensive  starting materials. 
              Complementing this synthetic economy is the  efficiency of the self-assembly
              process.  Spontaneously, arrays  of intra-and intermolecular contacts are
              formed with high  fidelity and specificity.  Finally, the synthetic
              accessibility  of the polyimides and highly coherent structures of their 
              assemblies enable their rational elaboration into more complex  extended
              architectures and materials.  %%%  This project should enhance our ability to
              design novel materials  through self-assembling processes in a direct and
              benign way  exemplified by nature.  ***
