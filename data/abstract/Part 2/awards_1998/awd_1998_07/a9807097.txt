                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9807097    INVESTIGATOR(S) : CALDWELL   
              INSTITUTION: UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY     The aims of this proposal are to
              investigate how plants of different life forms and soil microbes react to and
              influence soil moisture and nitrogen pulses in a Great Basin ecosystem.  Based
              at Utah State University, 5 principal investigators with expertise ranging from
              microbiology to remote sensing have developed an integrated research design
              focused on these issues from different perspectives and scales.  The role of
              hydraulic lift (i.e., water absorption at depth and nocturnal release into
              upper soil layers) is featured, as a process that may be particularly important
              in facilitating acquisition of both water and N in the face of temporal
              variability.  Other emphases include research on the significance of root
              distributions, on microbial processes that mediate N availability in variable
              environments, and on the role of different plant life forms.   Although the
              study is set in the Great Basin biome, these topics are relevant to almost all
              terrestrial ecosystems including agricultural systems, and there are also clear
              implications for response of terrestrial ecosystems to global environmental
              change.  The work also has considerable impor6t for watershed hydrology and
              human manipulation of vegetation in the Great Basin.
