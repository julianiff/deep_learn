Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998. 
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of  cell biology. 
              The research and training plan is  entitled analysis of cytoplasmic dynein
              light intermediate  chains.  Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end directed
              microtubule motor  complex  that has been implicated in a wide array of 
              cellular processes including  retrograde axonal transport,  centripetal
              organelle transport, chromosome  movement and  spindle organization during
              mitosis. This  project is a  study of the role of the light intermediate chain
              subunits  of  cytoplasmic dynein in the regulation and targeting of  this motor
              protein.
