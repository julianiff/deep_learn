Abstract    :
                    This award supports a two day workshop on April 1-2, 1998 to develop a
              plan  to implement a Quality of Service infrastructure.  The approximately 100 
              participants represent the following groups:  Gigapop operators, universitites,
              appropriate corporate partners, invited researchers, and applications efforts. 
              Results of this award include a specific plan for QoS testing, leading to an
              action plan for implementation.  An initial report was posted on the Internet
              within one month of the conference, and a hard cover publication followed.
