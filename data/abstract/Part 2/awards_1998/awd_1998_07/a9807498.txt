Abstract    :
              Grandinetti is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   to
              study non-crystalline silicate glasses using NMR spectroscopy.  The   primary
              objectives of this project are (1) to apply two-dimensional   solid-state NMR
              methodologies in the measurement of structural   distributions in silicate
              glasses, and (2) to develop oxygen-17   solid-state NMR as a probe of oxygen
              coordination number and geometry in   silicate materials.  The increased
              understanding of the structure of   network modified silicate glasses that will
              emerge from this work is   expected to help refine potential functions used for
              molecular dynamics   simulations of silicates, to assist in confirming
              structural   thermodynamic models of silicate glasses and melts, to improve  
              understanding of ionic transport, and to increase the utility of   oxygen-17
              NMR as a probe of related systems such as ceramics, catalysts,   and
              biopolymers.  The characteristics of non-crystalline materials can be varied by
                adjusting their compositions, an advantage in the design and preparation   of
              materials with controllable properties.  The structure/property   relationships
              in non-crystalline materials, however, need to be   understood better in order
              to facilitate design strategies for materials   with predictable features.  The
              combined experimental and computational   study of glassy materials in this
              project will enhance the knowledge base   for materials development, and impact
              as well on fields such as inorganic   geochemistry and waste containment glass
              technology.
