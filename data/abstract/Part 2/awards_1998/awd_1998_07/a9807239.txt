This one-year award will support participation of eight US
              students to attend workshops on "Three-Dimensional Modeling of Seismic Waves
              Generation, Propagation and Their Inversion," to be held at the International
              Center of Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, September 28 - October
              9, 1998.  The workshops will provide a venue for students' interactions with
              world-class lecturers and with other students from both European Union and
              developing countries, and will offer the latest developments in European
              tomography.  The students will have the opportunity to develop the contacts for
              subsequent research collaborations throughout the world.
