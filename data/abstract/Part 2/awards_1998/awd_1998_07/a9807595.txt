Abstract    :
              The process called `structural adjustment` means many developing countries in
              the world are reducing the size of their public sector. The impact of these
              reductions on state-provided medical services in Senegal is the subject of this
              dissertation research project by an anthropology student from Michigan State
              University. The project will look at medical behavior of people in urban and
              rural locations to assess the health impacts and strategies used by men and
              women and children. Specific hypotheses dealing with the differences of medical
              care-seeking of individuals varying in residential type, gender, age and class
              will be tested. For example, women of all residential locations and classes are
              hypothesized to be more active in organizing family health care than men;
              women's groups enrolling men into their health care projects will be expected
              to achieve their goals more often than groups which do not include men; the
              impact of the reduction of state services is expected to expand the role of
              traditional, non-biomedical practitioners, who are also hypothesized to include
              more bio-medical therapies in their practices. The methods include analysis of
              the change in state services through interviews and health statistics
              documents; a survey of available health resources in two locations in Senegal,
              an urban neighborhood and a rural village; interviews and focus group
              discussions with local people, and a health survey of 300 households, and a
              morbidity study of 50 households visited once monthly for three months. This
              project should advance our understanding of the health impacts of a global
              process of structural adjustment by moving beyond a focus on individual
              decision making to include structural constraints on choice. In addition to
              training a young social scientist the project will provide valuable
              ethnographic information on this important area of the world.
