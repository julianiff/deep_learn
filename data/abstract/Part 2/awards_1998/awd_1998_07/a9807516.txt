Abstract    :
                 Students of evolutionary biology are involved in testing predictions about
              how animals make a living.  `Making a living` is shorthand for studying how
              animals search for food, avoid predators, and reproduce successfully.  It is
              assumed that, like us, animals do not have time to perform an infinite variety
              of tasks; some are more important than others.  Finding food and avoiding
              predators are critical to survival even before reproduction can become an
              issue, and food fuels all of these activities.  Since most primates need to
              refuel every day, the ability of each individual to find food is an essential
              daily activity.   This study examines how Venezuelan white faced saki monkeys
              (Pithecia pithecia) solve the problem of finding and using food. White faced
              sakis live in small social groups that travel together from morning to evening.
               Finding food is thus both an individual and social problem.  We will employ
              interdisciplinary methods to examine how female sakis, who like all female
              mammals are under stronger energy constraints than males, balance nutritional
              needs in different reproductive states (estrous cycles, pregnancy and
              lactation).  Traditional behavioral methods of observation will be combined
              with recently developed laboratory techniques to help us understand how females
              make individual choices based on reproductive status and nutritional value of
              the foods.
