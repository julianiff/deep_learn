Abstract    :
              ***  9807501  Walden     This project is an experimental study of long-wave
              radiation processes near the surface at South Pole station.  Instrumentation
              capable of high resolution measurements of the infrared radiation fluxes at the
              snow surface -- a so-called Fourier Transform Interferometer -- will be
              developed and put in place in late 1999 and operated through the following
              austral winter.   Supporting observations of the temperature and moisture
              profiles in the lower atmosphere, and of ice crystals in the atmospheric
              boundary layer will be made.   Long-wave radiation (also called infrared or
              thermal radiation) is an important component in the energy balance of the
              atmosphere. On the antarctic continent radiation processes dominate the surface
              energy budget.  In summer the balance is made up of four terms (incoming and
              reflected short-wave or solar radiation, and emitted and reflected long-wave
              radiation); in winter after sunset the short-wave terms are zero.  The emitted
              long-wave radiation varies with temperature so that the condition of radiation
              balance at the surface will determine a particular value of the surface
              temperature.   This study includes several experiments concerning the emission
              characteristics of snow, of ice crystals in the atmosphere, and of greenhouse
              gases near the surface.  The concurrent environmental conditions such as cloud
              base altitude, temperature and humidity structure, ice crystal sizes and
              concentrations will allow the development of a climatology of cloud properties,
              and substantially improved representations of radiation processes in general
              circulation models.  ***
