Abstract    :
                Linkage disequilibrium can be defined as the nonrandom association of alleles
              at two or more genetic loci.  Such an association is usually observed when the
              loci are located very near each other on the same chromosome, a condition known
              as linkage.  When genes are tightly linked, they are only rarely separated by
              recombination, that is the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes. 
              Because of the combined effect of mutation and recombination on shaping the
              pattern of genetic variation, linkage disequilibrium is a powerful tool to
              investigate recent evolutionary events such as those that are likely to have
              characterized the evolution of modern humans.  In particular, the study of
              variation at tightly linked loci in the major ethnic groups will be used to
              discriminate between different scenarios of demography and population
              structure.  This will be achieved by reconstructing haplotypes, the joint
              presence of alleles at closely linked loci, at anonymous genome regions in
              ethnically diverse human populations and by measuring pairwise linkage
              disequilibrium, as well as the extent of haplotype sharing, within and between
              the population samples.  These studies are likely to contribute to our
              understanding of human origins and the elucidation of the structure of human
              variation.  In addition, they will provide the necessary background information
              for studies aimed at detecting the signature of natural selection at the
              molecular level.
