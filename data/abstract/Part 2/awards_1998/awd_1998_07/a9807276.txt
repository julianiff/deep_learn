Abstract    :
                    9713739  Jones  This project is to conduct the analysis of wind load and 
              structural resistance data from the Town of Southern Shores  (North Carolina)
              low-rise training facility structure.  With the  support of Project Blue Sky -
              developed by the Town of Southern  Shores and funded through FEMA and
              industrial sponsor - the PI is  installing a full-scale measurement system in
              the Pitts Training  center.  The system will record the wind environment,
              pressures,  and structural response for a multi-year period.    The analysis of
              the collected data will be made using state-of-  the-art procedures, and the
              tailoring and further development of  those procedures to the wind engineering
              context.  Specifically,  in addition to routine statistical analyses, the
              wavelet  transform will be used as a fundamental tool to improve  understanding
              of the physical processes involved in bluff-body  aerodynamics.  In addition,
              it is envisioned that these  techniques will improve our ability to model wind
              loads on bluff  structures through the use of wind tunnel techniques.    If the
              structure experiences Atlantic storms over the next two-  year period, the
              likelihood that high-quality data will be  collected under strong- (up to
              hurricane-) wind conditions is  high.  These data will be unique, and
              potentially will provide  insights into wind loading on low-rise structures
              that have  heretofore been impossible.  ***
