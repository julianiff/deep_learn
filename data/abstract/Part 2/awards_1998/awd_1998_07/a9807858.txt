Abstract    :
              9807858  White           Neuroscientists have long wished they had the means to 
                switch different types of brain cell off and back on again in    experimental
              animals. By doing so, they could investigate    quite specifically how each
              type of brain cell helps the    brain perform its various functions. The aim of
              this project    is to develop just such a technique in genetically engineered  
               mice. The technique makes use of a kind of protein called a    potassium
              channel, commonly used by cells to carry electrical    signals. The potassium
              channel in this case has been altered,    however, to act as a current shunt
              and to effectively short-    circuit the cells that express it. By directing
              the    expression of this "shunt channel" to specific classes of    brain cells
              and by controlling its expression with a drug it    can be transformed into a
              cell-type specific switch. When the    "shunt channel" is expressed, the brain
              cells that express it    will be "off," or electrically silent; when it is not 
                expressed, the brain cells will be "on," and functioning    normally.      
              Techniques for regulating protein expression in the manner    described are
              being developed in mice, specifically for a    class of brain cell thought to
              be essential in memory    formation. These cells, called hippocampal pyramidal
              cells,    will be the first target for testing the "shunt channel"    switch.
              The hope is to demonstrate that these hippocampal    pyramidal cells can be
              turned "on" and "off," using the    technique described, and that their role in
              memory formation    can be better defined. In particular, it will be
              interesting    to see if the ability to form memories can be switched "on"   
              and "off with these brain cells. If the technique is    successful, it should
              allow not only a more detailed    dissection of the process of memory than has
              been possible so    far, but also provide the general method for studying brain
                 cell function that brain scientists have long sought.
