Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State   University to
              upgrade a Circular Dichroism (CD) spectrometer. The   acquisition will enhance
              chemical research in the following areas:  (a)   peptide deformylase: 
              mechanism and inhibitor design; (b) enzyme   mechanisms and structure-function
              relationship; (c) water-soluble   dendrimers for asymmetric catalysis; (d)
              cooperative binding of metal   complexes to DNA monitored by CD spectroscopy;
              (e) structure-function   studies of Fe-S proteins and lytic peptides; (6)
              structure-function   studies on signal peptidase 1.  Measurements of optical
              activity have long played an essential role in   the development of organic
              chemistry and biochemistry.  The study of   optical rotatory dispersion (ORD)
              or circular dichroism (CD) provides   important information about the
              electronic states or structures of   individual molecules or ions.  These
              techniques are used when studying   absolute configurations of molecules,
              reaction mechanisms and kinetics,   asymmetric or stereospecific synthesis,
              thermodynamic properties of   dissolved species, and many other stereochemical
              problems.
