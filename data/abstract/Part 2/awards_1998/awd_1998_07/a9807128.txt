Abstract    :
                9807128  Halliburton    This University/Industry collaborative GOALI proposal
              aims for  improved ternary and quaternary chalcopyrites (ZnGeP2, CdGeAs2, 
              CdGe(As1-xPx)2, AgGaSe2, AgGa1-xInxSe2, AgGaTe2); potential  applications are
              frequency conversion, tunable lasing and optical  parametric oscillator (OPO)
              materials. Professor Larry  Halliburton at West Virginia University (WVU) is
              collaborating  with Sanders, Nashua, NH where crystal growth research will be 
              done in collaboration with characterization studies at WVU.  Techniques to
              assess defects in these materials include EPR,  photo-induced EPR and
              photo-induced ENDOR. An important feature  of the project is the feed-back loop
              with the Sanders crystal  group, both in growth and post-growth treatments of
              the  materials. The knowledge obtained from defect characterization  will
              provide guidelines for modification in the crystal growth  and post-growth
              treatment that is expected to lead to materials  with optimized nonlinear
              optical properties. The project is co-  supported by the DMR Electronic
              Materials Program and the MPS  OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).   
              %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of 
              materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic/magnetic  devices. The basic knowledge and
              understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving
              the performance  and stability of advanced photonic devices by providing a 
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is
              the integration of research and  education through the training of students in
              a fundamentally and  technologically significant area, and in providing an
              important  opportunity through the GOALI aspect of the project for students  to
              experience both academic and industrial research  approaches  and environments.
