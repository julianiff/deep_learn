Abstract    :
              Abstract  Prasad, V.      The award is to partially support a workshop on
              "Thermal Aspects of Manufacturing and Materials Processing."  The objective of
              the workshop is to bring together a cross section of people knowledgeable in
              areas of emerging technology and researchers with a strong interest in thermal
              processing to exchange information and to explore common technical areas.   
              The workshop is directed towards industrial and academic participation.  It
              will take place over two days in conjunction with the 1998 International
              Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (to be held at Anaheim,
              California) and will involve presentations of current state-of-the-art, future
              trends, and critical thermal issues made by representatives from industry and
              federal laboratories and subsequent discussion by all attendees.  The topics
              range from chemical vapor deposition for electronics to property measurements
              for model reliability and includes ceramic, laser, plasma, polymer and thermal
              processing, MEMS, nanostructures, and in-situ measurements.  A printed report
              will be prepared for dissemination to government agencies and industry and web
              based version will be prepared for electronic access by academics and others.
