Abstract    :
              9807061  Grosch, Herbert  Unaffiliated Individual    Special Project: Chronicle
              of Early Datamation Magazine    This project provides partial support for the
              PI to develop a chronicle of early issues (for up to twenty years from its
              inception in 1957) of the magazine DATAMATION, one of the most important
              sources of information about computer hardware, software, the community of
              users and installations, conferences, and user group meetings in those early
              years of computing.  The PI will review every issue page by page and item by
              item, and construct a chronicle of the events of those decades, drawing on his
              personal and unique acquaintance with the publication and his involvement in
              the events and the people described.  Cumulations of the work will be issued
              every six months on CD/ROM or DVD discs and the work will be announced in the
              Annals of the History of Computing and other appropriate publications.
