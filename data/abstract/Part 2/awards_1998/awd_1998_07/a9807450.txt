Abstract    :
              Over the past thirty years public schools have systematically weakened their
              disciplinary measures, lessening the constraints on acceptable student
              behavior.  There is good reason to hypothesize that these changes in school
              disciplinary policies have had major effects on student achievement, since
              these policies provide the parameters in which student peer climates emerge. 
              Although there has been a national decline in the severity of public school
              disciplinary practices, states have varied to the extent that they have
              constrained the latitude of local school authorities.  Possible explanations
              for this state-level variation rely on theories that emphasize either internal
              organizational factors or external environmental forces.
    The research
              will: use Office of Civil Rights data to create a map of state-level variation
              in school disciplinary practices from 1974 to 1992; create a state-level
              dataset of internal organizational and external environmental factors related
              to state-level variation in public school disciplinary practices, including
              coding of related legislation and litigation on student rights; and analyze
              state-level data separately and in multi-level models with individual-level
              student outcomes to identify the causes and consequences of changes in public
              school disciplinary practices.
