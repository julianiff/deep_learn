Abstract    :
              With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is
              continuing support for Dr. Mark Distefano at the University of   Minnesota -
              Twin Cities.   The objectives of the work are to: 1) improve   the activities
              and enantioselectivities of transaminating catalysts based   on protein
              cavities of mutant FABPs (Fatty Acid Binding Proteins), 2)   assess the effects
              of cofactor structure, 3) expand the scope of reaction   types to include C-C
              bond formation, 4) develop methods to prepare and screen rapidly catalyst
              candidates, and 5) develop a phage display   system to select protein cavities
              that can bind pyridoxamine analogues   noncovalently.  Dr. Distefano is
              developing a series of novel semisynthetic enzyme-like   catalysts based on a
              class of proteins (FABPs) that contain a large   empty central cavity, which
              can be used to hold organic substrates while   they are operated on by
              cofactors that are chemically linked to the   protein.   The FABPs can be
              easily cloned and efficiently expressed,   allowing considerable variability in
              their size and composition.   Such   catalysts could be very useful in the
              preparation of a wide variety of   specialty chemicals.   Because they operate
              in water under mild   conditions and are prepared from biodegradable materials,
              they are also   environmentally attractive.
