Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State   University to
              purchase two eight node SMP computers and an experimental   cluster of eight
              microcomputers.  This equipment will enhance research in   a variety of areas
              including quantum chemistry, surface chemistry   simulations, sulfur
              photochemistry, solid state chemistry of   intermetallic compounds, and high
              resolution   photoionization-photoelectron-photodissociation studies.  A 
              network of   fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
              computing   needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer network` also
              serves as   a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
                provides  graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in  
              state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
