Abstract    :
              Hilbish  9807055    The El Ni o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is the
              most important process regulating year-to-year climate variation in the
              Pacific.  The ENSO cycle affects patterns of ocean circulation as well as
              climate.  During an El Ni o year there is an increased movement of water
              northward; consequently there is northward shift in the distribution of many
              marine species.  The investigator, Dr. Thomas J. Hilbish of the University of
              South Carolina, has previously examined the distribution of a marine mussel
              that was introduced to Southern California earlier this century.  Since its
              introduction this species has expanded its range northward and formed a hybrid
              zone with a native species of mussel.  These mussels are important ecological
              constituents of marine communities on the west coast of North America and the
              introduced species is used in aquaculture operations in California and
              Washington.    Previous studies indicate that the migration of the introduced
              species and the hybrid zone has stopped at Cape Mendocino, California.  Dr.
              Hilbish will test the hypothesis that further migration northward has been
              prevented by upwelling that forms during the summer around Cape Mendocino,
              which causes the movement of mussel larvae offshore, where they die.  Dr.
              Hilbish has predicted that migration northward would resume during an El Ni o
              year because upwelling is greatly reduced during this time.  The 1997 El Ni o
              event is the second largest ever recorded and coincides with the period of time
              that mussel larvae are dispersed.  Therefore he predicts that the northward
              movement of the introduced mussel species and the hybrid zone will occur this
              year and proposes to sample mussel juveniles as they recruit in the area around
              and north of Cape Mendocino.    This work will test the hypothesis that
              circulation patterns controlled by the ENSO cycle regulate the dispersal and
              distribution of near-shore marine species, including marine mussels.  This
              study will also help determine whether the expan sion of the introduced mussel
              species will continue and which regions are most likely to become contaminated.
