This three-year award supports US-Portuguese collaborative
              research in the area of hadronic physics between Stephen Cotanch and Eric
              Swanson of North Carolina State University and Jose Ribeiro of the Instituto
              Superior Tecnico, Lisbon.  The objectives of their research are to study
              problems in Quantum Chromodynamics (QDC) related to the structure of mesons and
              baryons, and to determine experimental signatures for glueballs, hybrid mesons,
              and the strangeness content of the nucleon.  The project will combine an
              effective, field theoretical Hamiltonian from QCD combined with
              phenomenological insights derived from chiral symmetry.  It will incorporate
              precise, new experimental information from the Jefferson National Accelerator
              Facility and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

The US investigators and their
              students bring to this collaboration strengths in many-body and field theory
              and phenomenology.  This is complemented by the Portuguese calculational
              expertise and an extension of their meson-baryon codes to accommodate an
              improved theoretical treatment and a focus on the implications of chiral
              symmetry.
