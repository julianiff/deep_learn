Abstract    :
              This workshop is on evaluating priorities for research within the VLSI testing 
              field, with the intention that the results of the meeting aid in refocusing the
               field on research necessary to algorithms, techniques and methodologies for 
              testing deep submicron VLSI chips. Future priorities for research and education
               are considered. Research areas that are already well-served by the test 
              communities in academia and industry and are unlikely to require major new 
              methods or technological breakthroughs are being examined. The workshop report 
              includes: (1) a statement of the most pressing problems to solve within the
              next  decade, (2) recommendations regarding the style and kind of research to
              be  conducted and suggestions to the community as to how to implement these 
              suggestions, and (3) viewpoints on increasing the impact of the VLSI test field
               on education in electrical and computer engineering.
