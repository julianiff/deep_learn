This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Research award is for a
              project on "Regional Atmospheric Forcings for Polar Motion" between Dr. David
              Salstein of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., and Dr. Barbara
              Kolaczek of the Space Research Center in Warsaw, Poland.  With the goal of
              strengthening the understanding of the dynamics of the Earth system, the
              researchers will perform collaborative research on global and regional
              atmospheric angular momentum fluctuations, and relationships with the
              fluctuations of the solid Earth motions, especially polar motion.  Topics
              include: (1) Investigation of the regional influences of atmospheric angular
              momentum signals from winds and pressure upon polar motion, especially on
              seasonal and subseasonal time scales including the relationships among
              different atmospheric regions; (2) Study of related atmospheric-ocean
              interaction, on subseasonal time scales, relating to rapid fluctuations in
              polar motion; (3) Study of the impact of El Nino and other interannual climate
              signals on all components of atmospheric angular momentum, Earth rotation,
              focusing on polar motion.  They will apply coherence. cross-spectral and
              similar analysis between atmospheric regions and global polar motion time
              series will be applied using atmospheric data primarily from a recently
              completed 40-year Reanalysis analysis for 1958-97.

This research in
              geophysical science fulfills the program objectives of bringing together
              leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
