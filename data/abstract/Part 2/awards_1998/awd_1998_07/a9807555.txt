The freshwater ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila, will be the
              experimental organism used to explore the developmental regulation of the
              conjugation program. The research objectives are: 1) To further explore the
              developmental dependencies and developmental logic underlying conjugation in
              Tetrahymena thermophila, 2) To use advanced microscopy techniques to produce an
              ultra-detailed description of nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions during critical
              points in development and, 3) To assist in the development and/or
              implementation of molecular genetic procedures designed to identify conjugation
              specific genes and explore their function.
 
Conjugation in Tetrahymena
              thermophila is interesting in that such fundamental cellular events as meiosis,
              nuclear exchange and fertilization, programmed nuclear elimination,
              transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome and genomic reorganization all
              occur within a highly synchronous population at well defined times during a
              twelve hour schedule. A method of generating mutations that affect the
              conjugation pathway was developed during the tenure of the previous award.
              Thirteen conjugation mutants affecting nearly every stage of conjugal
              development were isolated and characterized. Such characterization allowed the
              production of a detailed model of developmental dependencies, which underlie
              the conjugation program. The continuation of this work will not only allow
              further insight into fundamental genetic mechanisms but will serve to educate
              students in the demands as well as the satisfaction of basic research.
