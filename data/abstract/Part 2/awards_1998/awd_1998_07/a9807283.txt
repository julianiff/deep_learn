Abstract    :
              9807283  Stoebe  This is the first conference of a new Gordon Conference  series
              on materials science and engineering education.  The  conference aims at
              broadening content and improving teaching  methods in materials science and
              engineering education.  The  title of this conference is "Innovations in
              College Teaching  of Materials Science"; the focus is on innovations in 
              teaching approaches and in content of college level  introductory courses in
              materials science and engineering  (MSE) for both general students and science
              and engineering  majors. The conference will be held at Plymouth State 
              College, Plymouth, NH, on July 26-29, 1998.    The conference comes at a time
              when there is keen awareness,  both nationally and internationally, of the
              importance of  materials education. The conference organizers emphasize the 
              participation of undergraduate and community college  faculty, and of graduate
              students with interest in teaching  materials science through financial
              assistance with  attendance expenses.  %%%  ***
