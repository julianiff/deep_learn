Abstract    :
              A one day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day  (ECCAD), will be
              held at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis,  Maryland, on April 25, 1998. This
              series of meetings has become a  regular event for  the region, with different
              academic and  industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation.  The 
              purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance  understanding
              of the technical aspects of computer  algebra, by  providing a way for those in
              the region who are active or  interested in becoming more active in computer
              algebra to meet  with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. 
              This meeting is more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings,  with ample time
              for unstructured interaction.  Participation by  the region's graduate students
              is  particularly encouraged  through special invitation to  contribute to the
              poster sessions,  and through travel support.  Three invited lectures will
              anchor  the meeting and will help attract participants.  The invited  talks and
              poster sessions contributed by  the community will  cover the breadth of
              computer algebra: algorithms, software,  and applications.
