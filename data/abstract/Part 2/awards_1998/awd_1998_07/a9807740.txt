Abstract    :
              9807740  Farley   The Coast Mountains of British Columbia are central to two
              scientific questions concerning how an oblique convergent margin operates. 
              These involve the extent and rate of along-orogen transport of  terranes and
              uplift and erosion of attached blocks.  Paleomagnetic results indicating
              long-distance along-orogen transport are ambiguous because the plutons that
              were used for these data may have been tilted.  Part of this project will test
              for tilting using new techniques of low-temperature closure age methods.  These
              and associated structural data will also address the amount and rate of
              tectonic uplift in this nearly strike-slip end member of oblique collisional
              circumstances.  The work will benefit from and will complement geological and
              geophysical study along the ACCRETE transect.  Results are expected to help
              resolve the degree of northward transport of terranes along the western coast
              of North America and the uplift associated with oblique collision.
