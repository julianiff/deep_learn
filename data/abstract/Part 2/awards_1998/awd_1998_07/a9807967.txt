Abstract    :
              Collins  9807967         This workshop will examine the apparent causes of 
              global decline of amphibian populations.  Participants will  examine declines
              from endocrinogical, immunological, and  environmental perspectives. 
              Participants will represent the  United States, Europe,  Central America, and
              Australia.  The  goal of the workshop will be to determine how research on 
              amphibian decline can be more integrated and provide more  generic answers.
