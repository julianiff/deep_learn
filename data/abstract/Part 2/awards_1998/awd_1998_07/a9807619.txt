Abstract    :
              EIA9807619  John K. Flanagan  Brigham Young University    Experimental Systems: 
              A National Trace Collection and Distribution Resource.   Trace-driven
              simulation is an important technique for research in computer   architecture
              and compiler design.  A trace-driven simulation uses actual execution traces as
              input to a compuer system simulator that can estimate resource usage or
              execution time.  If both the system model and the input trace data represent
              the system under test, trace-driven simulation can be very accurate.   This
              project collects and distributes accurate and representative trace data from a
              variety of computer systems running various operating systems and application
              workloads.  Trace data is collected using commercial logic analyzers and a
              previously developed hardware monitor, which has successfully collected traces
              with billions of addresses from a variety of machines.  Once collected, traces
              are managed and stored using large disk   arrays and automated tapes, and are
              made available to users through the World-Wide Web, on tape, and on CD-ROM.
