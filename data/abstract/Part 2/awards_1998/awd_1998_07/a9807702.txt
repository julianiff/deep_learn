Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at The University   of Texas in
              Austin to acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector.   This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1) use
              of synthetic receptors and artificial enzymes; (2)   construction of assemblies
              capable of selective and reversible binding of   anions; (3) generation,
              structure and chemical properties of stable   radicals; (4) long-range
              asymmetric induction to control stereochemistry   over many achiral intervening
              atoms; (5) synthesis of complex products   that have biological activity; and
              (6) synthesis of new porphyrin   systems.   The X-ray diffractometer is used to
              make accurate and precise   measurements of the full three dimensional
              structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the precise values of
              all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives
              accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative
              to the neighboring   molecules.
