Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at
              Southern Methodist University studies the results of deindustrialization and
              job loss in a Southern town.  Taking the case of Monroeville, Alabama, the
              student will examine the differential impact of the recent close of an apparel
              manufacturing plant on Caucasian and African American men and women's lives and
              work.  Using ethnographic methods of participant observation, semi-structured
              and formal interviews and archival research, the student will test hypotheses
              about the more negative impact of job loss on women (than men) and on White
              women (than Black women), due to differences in the size and nature of family
              networks.  This case study will advance theory explaining changes in women's
              position in society due to the addition or loss of income from wage labor. The
              comparison will help us understand the complexities of the process of
              deindustrialization and job loss, and this understanding should be valuable to
              planners and social service providers.  In addition the research will help
              train a young scientist.
