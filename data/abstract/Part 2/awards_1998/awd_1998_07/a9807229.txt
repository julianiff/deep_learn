Abstract    :
              Vladimir Mandelshtam is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop methods for the study of   quantum
              dynamics in molecules and clusters.  His central technique is the  
              filter-diagonalization method, with the utilization of Chebyshev   dynamics. 
              Spectra will be computed and analyzed for unimolecular   dissociation and
              recombination processes.   Applications include   triatomic species such as
              nitorgen dioxide, formyl radical, and nitrosyl   hydride, with emphasis placed
              on non-adiabatic effects, including   Renner-Teller coupling and conical
              intersections.  Longer-term   applications include quantum effects in water and
              argon/hydrogen fluoride   clusters.  Theoretical studies of chemical dynamics
              based on accurate quantum   mechanical calculations are only possible for small
              molecules.  Therefore   such studies play a fundamental role in understanding
              the dynamics of   much larger systems and in relating exising approximate
              theories to   accurate quantum results.  Of special interest here are systems
              with   chaotic underlying classical dynamics and high densities of states.  A  
              complex quantum dynamics with unassignable spectra offers a challenge   even in
              the case of triatomic molecules.
