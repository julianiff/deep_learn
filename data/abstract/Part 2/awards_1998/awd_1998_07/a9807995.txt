Abstract    :
              The overall aim of the proposed research is to understand the role of paternally
              contributed components for the earliest stages of animal development.  Paternal
              effect mutants provide powerful tools to identify molecules of paternal origin
              that are essential for embryogenesis. The function of a set of genes whose
              products act within a narrow window of time, from the initial response of the
              sperm to the egg cytoplasm to the completion of the first embryonic mitosis,
              will be studied at the cellular, genetic, and molecular levels.

SPECIFIC
              AIMS

1) To understand the function of the ms(3)sneaky (snky) gene in sperm
              activation after entry into 
 the egg, the Wakimoto lab will:

a)
              molecularly clone the gene to characterize its expression profile and identify
              its RNA and protein products
b) determine the subcellular distribution of the
              SNKY protein by immunolocalization
c) track the behavior of membrane markers
              in snky mutant sperm to test the hypothesis that the paternal effect defect
              results from failure of plasma membrane breakdown
 
2) To understand the role
              of the ms(3)K81 gene in restructuring or replicating the sperm nucleus after
              insemination, the lab will: 

a) examine the distribution of the K81
              transcript and protein during spermatogenesis and embryogenesis using
              immunolocalization 
b) examine the functional relatedness of K81 to a newly
              discovered, closely related K81-like Drosophila protein

3) To examine the
              functional relationships between genes that are similar to snky and-K81
              in
causing early developmental defects; the lab will:

a) genetically
              characterize and initiate molecular mapping of a newly discovered gene called
              pop-sickle, which when mutant is phenotypically indistinguishable from the snky
              mutation
b) genetically characterize and initiate molecular mapping of a newly
              discovered gene called
deadbeat, which when mutant is phenotypically
              indistinguishable from the K81 mutation
c) examine the genetic interactions
              between these genes, snky and K81 to elucidate their relative times of action
