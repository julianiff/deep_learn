Abstract    :
              The agreement provides for the National Laboratory for Applied Networking
              Research (NLANR)s Measurement and Operations Analysis Team (MOAT), led by
              Principal Investigator Hans-Werner Braun, to continue the NLANR research
              activities that have been ongoing at UCSD since 1995.  In addition to measuring
              and analyzing vBNS traffic data, NLANR/MOAT will promote the continued
              development, testing and deployment of publicly-available measurement and
              analysis tools and techniques. NLANR/MOAT will facilitate the early
              identification and analisis of performance (both network-centric and
              applications-centric) trends and problems (related to the VBNS and
              interconnected High Performance networks and institutions).  This will be
              accomplished by deploying flow monitors and conducting performance measurements
              on HPC connections to the vBNS, on select vBNS partner nodes, and at other key
              sites (particularly vBNS aggregation points, such as GigaPOPs and NGIXen). 
              Resulting data and analysis on Internet traffic performance and traffic flows
              will then be made available to the research community and the general public.
