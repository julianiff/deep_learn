This U.S.-Czech research project between Larry
              Kesmodel of Indiana University, Bloomington, and Vladimir Matolin of Charles
              University, Prague, features examination of model catalysts consisting of small
              palladium (Pd) particles deposited on a flat support.  Under high vacuum, these
              model systems permit controlled simulation of irregularities that are more
              highly representative of real catalysts.  The researchers intend to use surface
              science methods to study the metal-support interactions and their influence on
              the CO adsorption and surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on Pd.  New palladium
              single crystals will be used in interpreting results from the more complex
              model catalysts.  Results should improve our understanding of why the physical
              and chemical properties of smaller metal particles are size dependent.

This
              project in analytical and surface chemistry fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
              and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
