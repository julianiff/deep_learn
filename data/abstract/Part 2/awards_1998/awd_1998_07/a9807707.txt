Abstract    :
              This award to Prof. Richard McCullough at Carnegie-Mellon University is  
              supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the   Chemistry
              Division. The goal of the research is the design, synthesis and  
              characterization of regioselective conducting polymers and oligomers   which
              controllably self-assemble into conducting nanostructures.    Amphiphilic
              polythiophene copolymers will be prepared which self assemble   on surfaces to
              form single molecule thick nanowires. By attaching   substituents that respond
              to ions or metals, polythiophenes will be made   whose conjugation and hence
              electronic and optical properties can be   controlled by analytes.   The
              ability to control ordering and consequently optical and electronic  
              properties in conjugated organic materials will lead to lower cost   solution
              processing of organic transistors for low technology   applications such as
              phone cards, identification cards and price and   inventory labels.
              Polythiophenes which respond to analytes are likely to   find application in
              sensors, bio-indicators, pH sensitive membranes and   other electronic devices.
              The research which is broadly interdisciplinary   will provide a rich
              environment for the training of graduate and   undergraduate students.
