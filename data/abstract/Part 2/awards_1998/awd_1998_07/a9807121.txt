Abstract    :
                This is a study of how African American women use language to construct
              `(re)presentations of self' and community during everyday cultural practices.
              The main locus of this work is the socialization of African American
              cosmetology students at a beauty college in Charleston, South Carolina, who
              work both in professional hair salons and in the kitchens of their own homes. 
              For many African American females, both the kitchen and salon are intimate
              spaces for conversation, cultural socialization, and hair care. As such, they
              are prime locales in which to investigate the pragmatics of women's 'socio
              culturally situated speech events.' Data for the project include audio  and
              video recordings of women's speech practices across lay and professional hair
              care contexts in California and South Carolina. Ethnographic and discourse
              analyses aim to delineate the pragmatic (e.g., identity construction),
              linguistic (e.g., grammar, lexicon) and interactional (e.g., turn taking)
              features of women's speech events, including client hairdresser negotiations,
              greetings, narratives, and hair care demonstrations and instruction. The
              comparative nature of this study will further illuminate degrees of language
              variation, continuity, and change among African American women throughout urban
              and rural centers in the U.S.
