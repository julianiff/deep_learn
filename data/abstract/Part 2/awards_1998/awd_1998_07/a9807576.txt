Abstract    :
              9807576  Wright    This project, sponsored by The Riverview Gardens School
              District, will use planning funds to prepare the teachers in the district to
              implement high quality materials in their elementary schools. As part of the
              planning effort to prepare school district personnel to carry out the necessary
              changes school district personnel will study currently available curriculum
              materials, visit school districts who have implemented these materials and work
              with consultants to develop a school change agenda. The district is developing
              a partnership with an adjacent school district which has already implemented
              new curriculum materials in their elementary schools and whose students have
              shown significant improvement in the state testing program.
