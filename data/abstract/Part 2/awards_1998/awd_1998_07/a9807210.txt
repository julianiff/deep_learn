An SGER award will support a study of the feasibility of
              generating dense, strong and hard surface layers on cement surfaces from
              carbonation reactions of calcium-silica hydrate in the cement with ambient
              carbon dioxide.  The calcium-silicate hydroxide is to be obtained from an
              initial reation of lithium silicate with calcium hydroxide, producing also
              lithium hydroxide which is expected to minimize the detrimental alkali-silica
              reaction.  Mechanical, microstructural and reaction rate properties will be
              determined for a number of compositions in order to optimize the surface
              properties for strength and impermeability to water.
