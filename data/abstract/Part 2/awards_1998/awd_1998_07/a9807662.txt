Rapid microbial oxidation of arsenic (As) from the +III to +V
              oxidation state has been observed in the geothermally-influenced surface waters
              of Hot Creek Gorge, located in California's Owens Valley.  This project will
              investigate the biochemical mechanism and ecological aspects of this microbial
              process.  Arsenic-oxidizing strain(s) will be isolated from a mixed culture,
              obtained from Hot Creek, that is currently being maintained in the P.I.'s
              laboratory and retains the capacity to oxidize As(III).  Gene probes (based on
              16s-rRNA sequences) will be developed for the mixed culture and used to guide
              the isolation of pure culture(s) of As(III) oxidizers, to perform genetic
              characterization and phylogenetic classification of pure strain(s), and to
              determine the spatial distribution of As(III) oxidizing bacteria at the field
              site in Hot Creek Gorge.  Biochemical studies will be performed with the
              isolated As(III)-oxidizing strain(s) to determine the kinetics and mechanism of
              microbial As(III) oxidation.  Coupled laboratory and field studies will be
              conducted to determine whether this process is associated with detoxification
              or with energy acquisition.  If resources allow, a preliminary evaluation will
              be made of the ecological consequences of the abundant microbial colonization
              of the surfaces of aquatic macrophytes, which was observed in previous field
              studies.

This proposal was part of the Environmental Geochemistry and
              Biogeochemistry program.  It will be jointly funded by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences, Division of Chemistry, Division of Earth Sciences, Division of
              Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.
