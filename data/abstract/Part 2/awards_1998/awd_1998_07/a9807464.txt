Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of stereoselective   reactions
              using chiral 2-oxazolines.  The study of binaphthyl ligands   carrying chiral
              oxazolines, polycyclic biaryls formed from an asymmetric   Ullman coupling and
              a simple route to (7)-helicenes will be carried out.   Chiral ketenimines will
              be used as intermediates for the production of   both cyclic and acyclic
              alpha-(quaternary) substituted ketones.  Also,   new routes leading to novel
              chiral ligands will be explored. With this   renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Albert I.
              Meyers of the Department of   Chemistry at Colorado State University. 
              Professor Meyers will focus his   work on projects designed to afford a wide
              variety of chiral substances.    The project relies on the use of oxazolines as
              the key intermediates for   the development of the methodology.  The work has
              potential impact in the   pharmaceutical industry and is a rich area for the
              training of graduate   students.
