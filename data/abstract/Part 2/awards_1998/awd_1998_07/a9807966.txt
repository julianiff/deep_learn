Abstract    :
              980796  Cullen  This project will produce an update to the Publication "The 
              Research Fleet: University-National Laboratory System" (UNOLS) which was
              published in 1991.   That publication is out of date and current supplies are
              depleted.  Text and design will be overseen by the UNOLS office, and Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution personnel will create the publication.  This brochure
              will be used to provide information to science users, the public and funding
              agencies about the ships operated by UNOLS institutions.  The Principle
              Investigator, Vicky Cullen is highly qualified to direct this project, having
              produced the current brochure.  ***
