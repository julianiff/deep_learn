Miniaturized measurement instruments have been developed in the
              field of MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) and their entry into
              biological studies will add a whole new dimension for investigations in
              microbiology.  The MEMS actuators have a length scale appropriate for probing
              on the sub-micron level and will provide a quantum leap in biological
              measurement capability for characterizing healthy as well as pathological cells
              at the single cell level, without destroying them.  We will simultaneously
              apply two new MEMS micro-instruments to a study of the early stages of
              development of a single mouse embryo.  We will probe the embryo to measure the
              embryo's internal fluid pressure, viscosity, dynamic response and elasticity of
              the embryo waft, and simultaneously measure the thermal activity (caloritnetry)
              of the embryo.  This project will thus provide the essential groundwork for
              launching a larger project involving all types of cells.
