The proposed research is an investigation of the late
              Quaternary paleoenvironmental record preserved in the small playa basins on the
              Southern High Plains of northwestern Texas and eastern New Mexico.  The goals
              of this project are to better understand: 1) cool-dry environments evolving
              into cool-moist ones in the late Pleistocene; 2) rapid and repeated shifts
              between cool-moist and warm-dry environments in the last millennia of the
              Pleistocene and early millennia of the Holocene; 3) the rate and timing of the
              environmental changes that resulted in the relatively dry and warm climate that
              characterized much of the early and middle Holocene; and 4) rapid and repeated
              environmental departures toward aridity in the past few millennia of the
              Holocene.  Preliminary investigations of playa fills indicate that they have
              dateable, continuous records of sedimentation spanning the late Quaternary, and
              that they contain paleoenvironmental indicators in the form of the sediments
              themselves, and also stable-carbon isotopes and phytoliths.  The work collected
              in the field.  The research will provide clues to the age and origin of a
              significant component of the Great Plains landscape.  More specifically, the
              studies will help in understanding the late Quaternary evolution of the
              environment of the Southern High Plains, a region known to be sensitive to
              environmental changes, the regional significance of environmental fluctuations,
              and the response of the High Plains landscape to these shifts.  The proposed
              research, therefore, will complement and, more importantly, strengthen and
              significantly expand the late-Quaternary paleoenvironmental record of landscape
              evolution and response to environmental change
