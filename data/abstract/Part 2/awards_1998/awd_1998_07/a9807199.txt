Abstract    :
              This  workshop  is  intended to  address  questions  of  how  current 
              technologies  can  be  assembled  into  a  coherent  framework  for
              multi-functional natural language systems  in  multiple  languages.   As the
              world becomes  more  and  more  dependent  on  global information resources,
              multimodal  and  multilingual technologies are being increasingly drawn  upon 
              to  serve monolingual user populations.  This workshop  will  assess  
              multilingual   resources,  information   retrieval,  machine translation,
              multilingual speech recognition, cross-  lingual summarization and information
              extraction, multimedia  communication,  evaluation and assessment, and  methods
               and  techniques  for natural language processing.  A report  will  be 
              presented  to the sponsors after public  discussion  and  critique.
