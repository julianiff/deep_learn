Shenai
This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on semiconductor
              device simulation and characterization techniques, organized by Dr. Krishna
              Shenai of the University of Illinois and Dr. Magali Estrada del Cueto of
              CINVESTAV-IPN.  It will be held at CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico, September 5-6,
              1998.
The workshop will focus on computer-aided design, modeling and
              characterization techniques used in the conception, development and
              manufacturing of semiconductor technologies with applications ranging from
              computing and communication to signal detection and information processing.
              Participants will conduct technical discussions on selected topics.  The
              meeting will emphasize the importance of simulation and characterization
              techniques for research and development of semiconductor devices and their
              introduction in undergraduate and graduate degree programs.
