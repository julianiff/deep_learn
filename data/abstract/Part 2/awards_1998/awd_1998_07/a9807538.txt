Abstract    :
              Klowden  9807538    In many species of mosquitoes, the females mate only once
              during their  lives. When the males inseminate the females shortly after they
              emerge,  they not only receive sperm to fertilize their eggs, but also products
              that  are transferred from the accessory gland of the male. These accessory
              gland  products have been believed to be active in the female in various ways, 
              switching her behavior to turn off subsequent mating behavior and activate 
              egg-laying, but these generalizations have been based on the easily  colonized
              Aedes mosquitoes that are usually the subjects of laboratory  research. None of
              the previous studies for which this accessory gland  mechanism has been
              determined have examined Anopheles mosquitoes, which are  important vectors of
              malaria. The PIs preliminary experiments indicate that  in these Anopheles
              mosquitoes, male accessory glands indeed have no role in  the behavioral
              switchover, although mating itself does affect the female in  several ways. The
              PIs research will determine how Anopheles mosquitoes are  affected by mating,
              and what possible role male accessory gland substances  do play in these
              mosquitoes. Because future methods of mosquito control may  involve the
              introduction of novel genes by modified males, it is important  to understand
              the mechanisms that regulate mating in these vectors of human  disease.
