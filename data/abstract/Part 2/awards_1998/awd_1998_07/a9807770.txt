Abstract    :
              	During the last decade, considerable progress has been made in determining the
              basic physical processes that govern ocean-atmosphere interaction in the
              Pacific Ocean and that are responsible for the slowly modulation El
              Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  To a significant degree, the extent to which
              warm and cold events influence global climate has been assessed, including the
              variability of that influence from event to event.  The questions arise:  is it
              possible to achieve the same degree of success with respect to predictions of
              the Asian-Australian monsoon variability and its global climate
              influence?

	A workshop will be held this summer (1998) to assess the
              potential for improved monsoon prediction and its impacts.  The workshop will
              involve scientists with expertise in meteorology, climate, oceanography, and
              land surface processes.  The specific objectives include:

* Assessing the
              status of knowledge of the variability and predictability of the
              Asian-Australian monsoon on time-scales from intraseasonal to interannual
*
              Assessing current abilities to model the monsoon system in stand-alone ocean
              and atmospheric models as well as coupled models
* Developing a strategy for
              advancing understanding of the monsoon system and its predictability

A
              report of findings and recommendations will be produced and made widely
              available to the community.

The Divisions of Atmospheric and Oceans Sciences
              at NSF as well as NOAA and NASA are sharing in the support for this award.
