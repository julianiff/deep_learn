Abstract    :
              This workshop is convened to foster the continuing dialogue concerning 
              approaches to enhance the professional careers of women involved in  research
              and education.  The meeting is organized by the Center for  Women's Studies and
              Gender Research at the University of Florida, and  the outcome of the meeting
              will be a document including conclusions and  recommendations pertinent for the
              community at large, and also the  product will inform NSF in planning for the
              assessment and continued  development of the POWRE (Professional Opportunities
              for Women in  Research and Education) program.  The workshop will bring
              together  scientists and engineers from the broad spectrum of academic and 
              non-academic professions, and the discussions will be led by invited  keynote
              speakers.  The format will include breakout sessions devoted to  topic
              including: 1) disciplinary and subdisciplinary differences among  women
              scientist, mathematicians and engineers, 2) alternative career  paths of women
              scientists in research and academia, and 3)  relationships with industry,
              government, professional societies: policy  implications.  This workshop and
              the resulting report document will  contribute to an better understanding of
              how to enhance and improve  scientific, engineering, and/or educational
              activities.      _  ??
