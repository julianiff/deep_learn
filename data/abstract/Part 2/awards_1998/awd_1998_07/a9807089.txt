Abstract    :
              Negron-Ortiz    DEB-9807089     The biogeography of the West Indies can be
              described as intricate.  The  relationships of a complex geological history of
              the region, numerous islands with unique histories, and a rich biota ranging
              from pan-Caribbean species to single island endemics are not well understood. 
              Vicariance and trans-oceanic dispersal are models proposed to explain the
              present-day distribution of the biota .  In order to understand the origins of
              the Caribbean flora, studies of Caribbean taxa are needed.  Until now most of
              the models tested have involved animals.   The PI proposes to use molecular and
              morphological data to construct evolutionary trees of two plant genera
              (Erithalis and Ernodea: Rubiaceae) endemic to the Caribbean Basin.  For each
              genus, relationships among species will be examined and these results will be
              integrated with distribution patterns to ascertain patterns of colonization
              events in the region.  Multiple populations of all taxa of both genera will be
              examined using morphological data and two molecular markers.  Many
              representative genera will be included as outgroups to determine the mainland
              geographical affinities of the two genera.  Resulting evolutionary trees will
              be compared to geographic distributions of the species to test biogeographical
              hypotheses.  Starting date:  August 15, 1998.
