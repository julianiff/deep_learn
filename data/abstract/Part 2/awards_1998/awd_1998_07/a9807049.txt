The goal of this project is to enlist undergraduate engineering
              students to provide custom designed toys, assistive devices or software which
              will enhance the life style or well being of persons who are physically or
              mentally challenged.  These undergraduate students will provide prototype
              equipment, equipment modification and/or software to meet the unique
              intellectual and/or physical requirements of a specific individual.  These
              items can not be obtained through any commercial enterprise.

Health care
              providers will identify a specific need for one of their clients.  The
              engineering student(s) will meet with the principal investigator (PI), health
              care providers and client to analyze the problem.  A detailed design will be
              produced by the student(s) guided by the PI.  After the design is approved by
              the health care provider, the student(s) will manufacture the
              prototype/software.  The health care provider will approve giving the toy,
              assistive device or software to the client for whom it was designed.
