When some event catches our attention we orient to
              the stimulus with a coordinated turn of the head and eyes.  This project
              explores the neural circuits that allow vision to guide this shift of gaze. 
              Most previous research has simplified the study of gaze by holding the
              subject's head rigid, thereby reducng the gaze movement to a movement of the
              eyes.  This sensible strategy may have led to a bias in the understanding of
              the function of several brain structures.  In particular, the "frontal eye
              fields" in the frontal lobe has been described almost strictly in terms of its
              control of eye movements, in the primate.  Recent evidence suggests that this
              structure may be more widely involved in the control of gaze.  The project
              proposes stimulation, lesion and recording studies designed to confirm the role
              of the frontal eye fields in controlling both eye and head movements.  All of
              the studies employ a behavioral task which will reveal if this brain areas is
              mapped to command eye, head, or gaze movements, and also to determine if its
              output specifies a vector of movement or a desired final position.
