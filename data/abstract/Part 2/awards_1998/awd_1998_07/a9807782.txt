Abstract    :
                 One class of sensory receptors is called hair cells, because these cells have
              a microscopic bundle of ultrastructural hairlike structures called cilia. 
              These sensory cells are responsive to mechanical deflection of the ciliary
              bundle, or in some cases the cilia contain molecules that act as receptors for
              specific molecular compounds, and so are chemosensory.  In the vertebrates,
              hair cells are found in the nose, tongue, and the inner ear and lateral line,
              and have been quite well studied.  This project measures electrophysiological
              responses cells of a similar ciliated form that are present in jellyfish, to
              compare to those properties of vertebrate hair cells.  A novel recording and
              stimulating system has been developed for these studies. 
   Results will be
              important for understanding fundamental properties of mechanoreception, and may
              provide some insight into the evolution of the class of sensory hair cells. 
              Additional impact of this project comes from the involvement of undergraduates
              and scientific outreach to underrepresented groups.
