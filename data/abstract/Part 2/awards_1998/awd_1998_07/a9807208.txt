Abstract    :
              The 1990s movement to define gender violence as a human rights violation raises
              basic questions about the cultural frame of the law, and the relationship
              between universal discourses of rights and cultural and religious difference.
              This project examines three approaches to gender violence in a small town in
              Hawaii.  One approach is based on the idea of rights and the use of the legal
              definition of battering within marriage as a crime; the second, evangelical
              Christian, is based on the religious conception of marriage and the family and
              seeks to preserve the marriage and develop a less violent relationship through
              divine assistance; the third, a Native Hawaiian problem-solving process, grows
              out of efforts to recuperate more consensual, community-grounded forms of
              conflict resolution by indigenous peoples.  These approaches represent
              competing paradigms of social justice, based on democracy and the rule of law,
              on religious faith, and on culturally distinct communities.  The researcher
              will study the implicit categories of persons and responsibilities involved in
              the different paradigms, and the relation of differences to global debates
              about gender violence and human rights.  Using ethnographic methods of in-depth
              interviews as well as case analysis of legal proceedings, collect documents and
              training materials and through participant observation, the researcher will
              advance our understanding of the often antagonistic, sometimes mutually
              constituted nature of these three paradigms of social justice.
