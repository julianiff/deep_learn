Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University to acquire a   CCD-based X-ray
              diffractometer.  This equipment will enhance research in   a  number of areas
              including (1) investigations of the organometallic   chemistry of carbon
              dioxide and its incorporation into catalytic   processes leading to useful
              chemicals; (2) structural characterization of   large cluster compounds; and
              (3) structural studies of novel,   biologically active natural products.   The
              X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the
              full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained
              gives the precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of
              the molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
