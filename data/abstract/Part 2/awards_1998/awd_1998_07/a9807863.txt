              Sharks play a pivotal role in the ecology of our oceans and only recently have
              we begun to view them as key to a healthy marine ecosystems instead of
              predators on man.  Along with this realization is the disturbing fact that man
              has over exploited shark populations to the extent that recovery of many
              populations is questionable.  Contrary to expectation, scientist have little
              data on how sharks feed, both from the perspective of how they capture their
              prey, but also in tems of the workings of their efficient feeding mechanisms. 
              With over 350 species in all the world's oceans, sharks provide one of the last
              unexplored frontiers in our understanding of predatory feeding behavior.  This
              study begins to unravel the mysteries of the shark feeding mechanism and their
              feeding behavior by thorough scientific analysis of prey capture in seven
              species of shark encompassing a diversity of feeding types.  Utilizing high
              speed video photography and electromyography, the monitoring of electrical
              signals from contracting jaw muscles, the PIs will investigate feeding in
              lemon, nurse, sand tiger, leopard, horn, bull, and sevengill sharks.  Together
              with work being conducted at other institutions, this study will lead to a
              better understanding of the evolution and functioning of shark feeding
              mechanisms and behaviors.
