Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998.   
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of  population
              biology.  The research and training plan is  entitled the effects of currents
              and larval dispersal period  on the genetic structure and evolution of
              Indonesian  stomatopod populations.  Molecular genetic techniques are  being
              used to compare patterns of gene flow and genetic  structuring in Indonesian
              stomatopods with similar/different  larval periods, across regions with
              unidirectional and  circular currents. Comparisons will be made in a 
              phylogenetic context to determine the effects of dispersal  period, currents,
              and evolutionary ancestry on the genetic  structuring and evolution of
              stomatopod populations
