Abstract    :
              Felker is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to   continue
              his ground-state spectroscopic studies of isolated, neutral   molecular
              clusters, using the technique of mass-selective,   ionization-detected
              stimulated Raman spectroscopy (IDSRS) developed in   his laboratory.  These
              studies focus on characterizing the intermolecular   vibrational level
              structures of neutral clusters, with primary goals of   obtaining information
              pertaining to intermolecular potential energy   surfaces and collective
              vibrational modes.  Systems for study include (1)   hydrogen-bonded dimers,
              including aromatics with water or ammonia, and   water dimers, (2) larger
              hydrogen-bonded and homogeneous aromatic   clusters, and (3) free radicals and
              their complexes with rare gas atoms   and small molecules.  The project also
              includes a computational effort to   simulate intermolecular Raman spectra to
              facilitate assignment of   observed bands and the extraction of intermolecular
              potential parameters   from experimental results.  The overall goal of this
              research program is   to advance the state of knowledge pertaining to how
              collections of   molecules interact with one another.   Outcomes from these
              studies are expected to impact the development of   force fields that are used
              in computer modeling of condensed phase   systems, including biologically
              important molecules,  molecules adsorbed   onto surfaces and new materials for
              technological applications.    Discovering detailed properties of water-based
              clusters, in particular,   could have important ramifications for improved
              understanding of   environmental and biochemical systems.
