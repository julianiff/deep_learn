Abstract    :
              9807881

Project involves development and implementation phases of a
              biological database for Peromyscus (deer mice and allied species). Mice of the
              genus Peromyscus are extremely abundant throughout North America and are widely
              used in pure and applied research. Research areas in which Peromyscus is
              commonly used includes ecology, genetics, systematics, evolution, behavior,
              physiology, metabolism, parasitology, epidemiology, and toxicology. Currently,
              there is no comprehensive database for this significant group of organisms,
              although more than 3500 journal articles have been published and several
              hundred investigators currently use Peromyscus in their research. The database
              envisioned, although including genetics, is expected to contain a broad range
              of information concerning many aspects of the biology of these rodents. This
              database, therefore, will differ substantially from the several mammalian
              genomic databases currently available. During the period 1998-2001 we intend to
              fully develop and have on-line three components:
	Systematics and
              Evolution,
	Genetics, and
	Neurobiology and Behavior. 
Additionally, a
              comprehensive bibliography for the genus will be accessible. The long-range
              objective is to have about eight or nine topical components of the database up
              to date and readily accessible on the internet within five years. After five
              years the database will be maintained independently of NSF database program
              support.
