The objectives of this research are to further develop a
              calcium phosphate ceramic (CPC) bonded multigauge measurement system and to use
              the system to monitor long-term bone strain changes during bone healing and
              remodeling.  The first objective, achieved using animal models in combination
              with proven mechanical testing and microscopic examination techniques, will be
              to establish faster initial bone bonding.  The second objective, achieved using
              a combination of animal and patient models, will be to document strain changes
              during bone formation and remodeling.
