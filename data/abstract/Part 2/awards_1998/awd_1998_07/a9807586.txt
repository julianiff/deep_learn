Abstract    :
              The American Association for Higher Education(AAHE) is organizing and hosting an
              Institutional Change Institute in Fall 1998 for teams from colleges and
              universities that will have implemented institutional changes based on reform
              in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) disciplines.  The
              project includes an examination and the dissemination of information about
              assessment and reform practices that have contributed to institutional change
              within these and other institutions.  The Institute has four central purposes: 
              (1) exchanging lessons from past and current initiatives, (2) expanding
              knowledge of assessment and reform strategies, (3) building a network of
              schools whose SMET disciplines are contributing to institutional reform, and
              (4) encouraging further institutional change.  The Institute will be
              characterized by keynote speakers or panels, small group discussions, and
              poster sessions by participants.  This forum provides opportunities to discuss
              assessment ideas of individual institutions.  A central activity of the
              Institute will be opportunities for the teams to consider how they will
              determine the success of the institution's reform efforts, and to draft
              evaluation plans, using practices described in plenary and discussion sessions
              about assessment and evaluation.  After the Fall 1998 institute, participating
              schools will have program slots set aside at the 1999 AAHE Assessment
              Conference to disseminate information about their progress to a cross
              disciplinary audience.  Prior to the Institute the AAHE Bulletin will feature
              material about Institute and after the Institute Change magazine will publish
              an article about institutional reform in the SMET disciplines.  The major
              publication will be a monograph following the Institute, which will include
              perspectives represented at the conference.
