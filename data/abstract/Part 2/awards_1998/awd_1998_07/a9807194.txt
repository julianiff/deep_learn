Abstract    :
              This interagency funding transfer covers observations at the Starfire Optical
              Range (SOR), as outlined in an NSF/USAF memorandum of understanding, and its
              amendment.  The SOR lidar measures gravity wave momentum, heat, and sodium
              fluxes, as well as the associated mean flow accelerations and cooling rates. 
              In addition, the SOR is being employed for studies of the Leonid meteor shower,
              a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study the backscatter and self-glow of long
              enduring meteor trails.
