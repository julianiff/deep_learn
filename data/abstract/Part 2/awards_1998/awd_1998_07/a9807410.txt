Abstract    :
              9807410  Bruch  This is a theoretical research grant on dynamical processes  in
              physical adsorption.  The goal is to achieve a  quantitative understanding of
              the interactions of atoms and  molecules with surfaces by treating conditions
              where highly  complex problems can be separated into more manageable  pieces. 
              The research subjects include the structures and  dynamics of atomically thin
              layers and the dynamical  processes coupling the layers to the supporting
              substrate.  Examples are chosen from recent inelastic helium scattering  and
              sliding friction experiments.  There continues to be a  strong connection to
              the more traditional electron and X-ray  diffraction experiments on adsorbed
              layers.  %%%  This is a theoretical research grant on dynamical processes  in
