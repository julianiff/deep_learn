Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to develop a structure  description and
              associated sequence-to-model structure  alignment scoring (evaluation schema)
              applicable to general  inverse protein folding methodologies.  The approach is 
              motivated by the recognition that there are currently no  practical means of
              predicting a protein's structure directly  from its sequence.  The project's
              approach is based on a  domain fold structural description.  Pseudo potential 
              functions are derived from the observed physical and/or  conserved residue
              interactions parameterized by the natural  tetrahedral geometry.  The
              information theory methods are  applied to optimize the most predictive pseudo
              potential  function.       This project has the potential of providing a major 
              step toward making the threading approach to protein  structure prediction and
              modeling a more viable tool.  It  will provide a better understanding of the
              underling  mathematical basis for developing Gibbsian scoring schema  for any
              sequence-to-structure alignment method and will aid  in the development of more
              efficient lower bound calculation  for the threading Brand-and-Bound optimal
              alignment  algorithm.
