Abstract    :
              9807245  Sozen    This award will support the management and coordination 
              activities of the Technical Coordination Committee for the  NSF initiative,
              "US-Japan Cooperative Research in Urban  Earthquake Disaster Mitigation."  This
              new initiative is  supported jointly by NSF and the Japanese Ministry of 
              Education, Science, Sports and Culture, together with other  relevant
              ministries and agencies in both countries.  A  counterpart technical
              coordination committee has been  established in Japan.   The U.S. committee
              will provide the  following services: 1) offer technical guidance for the 
              initiative; 2) organize domestic and bilateral technical  coordination meetings
              among active principal investigators  and invited experts;  3) facilitate
              exchange of research  data, information and personnel; 4) assist in the 
              development of partnerships with industrial companies; and  5) facilitate the
              transfer and utilization of knowledge and  technology resulting from the joint
              research.    The 1994 Northridge earthquake and 1995 Kobe earthquake  served as
              tragic reminders of how vulnerable our urban  environments are to natural
              disasters.  The US-Japan Urban  Earthquake Disaster Mitigation initiative is a
              US-Japan  Common Agenda program which aims to encourage and support  bilateral,
              interdisciplinary research for mitigation of  urban earthquake hazards.  ***
