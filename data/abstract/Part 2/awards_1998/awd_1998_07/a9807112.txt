Experimental Software Systems: Performance Impact of Contemporary
              Programming Paradigms and Workloads

The primary objective of this project is
              to characterize several contemporary programming paradigms, including
              object-oriented computing and networked computing.  This study investigates why
              contemporary programs (developed in C++, Java, etc.) tend to run slower than
              traditionally developed (e.g., Fortran and C) programs.  For example, when the
              same application is written in an object-oriented fashion and also constructed
              in a traditional procedural style, the object-oriented version is known to
              consume more memory, exhibit worse cache behavior, and to have less predictable
              branch behavior.  This research attempts to isolate these effects and trace
              them to specific elements of the object oriented programming style.  The
              principal benefit of this study is the collection of knowledge concerning how
              microprocessors should be designed in the future.  Design decisions and
              engineering tradeoffs in microprocessors are often based on assumptions made
              about the types of programs that these processors will execute.  However,
              detailed and accurate program characterization, such as those in this project,
              allows processor designers to make intelligent and informed engineering
              decisions.
