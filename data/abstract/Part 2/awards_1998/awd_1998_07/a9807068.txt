              Title: The Role of the Distribution of SST and Vegetation in Rainfall
              Variability Over West Africa    The request of $342,383/36 months is  to
              examine the hypothesis that the rainfall variability over West Africa is
              regulated by the meridional gradient of boundary layer conditions (entropy or
              moist static energy).  The influence of both vegetation distribution over land
              and SST variation over the tropical Atlantic ocean on the meridional gradient
              of the boundary layer will be examined.  Both historical data and numerical
              models will be utilized for the study.  The study is important since
              understanding monsoon variability over west Africa will help better predict
              droughts, floods; all this has high potential   societal impacts.
