Abstract    :
              9807023  Schoonen    This grant provides 50% of the funds to replace an existing
               Ion Chromatograph (IC) with an automated IC equipped with  UV/vis,
              electrochemical, and conductivity detectors for the  aqueous geochemistry
              laboratory at the State University of  New York at Stony Brook.  The PI, Martin
              Schoonen, has been  using  IC for the last decade in a number of different 
              research projects, including studies of the occurrence of  metastable 
              sulfoxyanions in (hydrothermal) waters, chloride  and sulfate incorporation in
              sedimentary carbonates, and  nitrate in groundwaters.  Other users of the
              existing and  new IC include the PI's colleagues Dr. Meyers, Reeder,  Parise
              and Hanson in the Department of Geosciences and Drs.  Taylor and Brownawell at
              the Marine Sciences Research  Center, SUNY-SB.    The new IC will be used as
              the main analytical tool in the  PI's geochemistry lab, while the existing IC
              will be used  for in-line analysis.  The new IC provides the PI with a 
              versatile analytical tool that can be used to determine both  inorganic cations
              and anions as well as various organic  constituents in natural waters and
              experimental fluids.  The  new IC is equipped with an autosampler and PC data 
              acquisition package.  This automation makes it possible to  conduct routine
              analyses unattended, boosting the  productivity of the PI's research group. 
              The existing IC  will be used as a dedicated in-line analyzer in experiments 
              that require continuous monitoring.  Support for the  acquisition of the new IC
              is shared by the NSF Earth  Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              (EAR/IF) and  SUNY-Stony Brook.  ***
