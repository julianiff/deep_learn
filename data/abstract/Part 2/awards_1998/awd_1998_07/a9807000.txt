This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Ali Banuazizi
              and Ms. Alison Carson, Boston College.   This proposal seeks funds for Alison
              Carson to carry out Ph.D. dissertation research in the Philippines to identify
              possible factors that influence differences in fairness reasoning and behavior
              in Filipino children.   One hundred eighty Filipino children in first, third
              and fifth grades will be included for this study.  Children's allocation
              behavior and justifications will be analyzed for cultural patterns influenced
              by developmental context, according to children's age, gender, socioeconomic
              status and rural vs. urban community of residence.  This is an important topic
              in psychology and the potential implications of this project are extensive,
              especially in extending our understanding of how children's cognitive
              development interacts with the social milieu to advance thinking about positive
              justice concepts.  This project can also provide an excellent training
              opportunity for Ms. Carson and her Filipino undergraduate students to extend
              their understanding of this subject.
