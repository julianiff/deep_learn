Neutron beta-decay provides fundamental data on the charged
              weak current form factors of the nucleon.  The goal of this project is to make
              use of ultracold neutrons (UCN's) to ultimately provide at least and order of
              magnitude improvement in the precision to which the beta-asymmetry is known. 
              Such a measurement, when coupled with the ongoing effort to improve
              measurements of the neutron lifetime (also through the use of UCN's), provides
              improved values for the weak axial form factor and the up-down CKM matrix
              element, as well as providing a sensitive test for extensions to the standard
              model.  The experiment will take place at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but
              will make extensive use of the resources available at Princeton for detector
              development, data acquisition, and data analysis.
