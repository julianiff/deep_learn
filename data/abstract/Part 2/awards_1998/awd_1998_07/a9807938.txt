Abstract    :
                  Insects provide a useful model system for analyzing the sense  of smell. 
              They use their large antennae to capture airborne  molecules, and the olfactory
              nerves to the insect brain send  signals to endings in central structures
              called glomeruli, which  have some organizational similarities to glomeruli in
              the  olfactory central nervous system of vertebrates.  It is not yet  clear how
              information is processed by the brain to analyze the  complicated spatial and
              temporal distribution of odor molecules  captured by an olfactory organ.  This
              project is to test a  quantitative mathematical analysis of olfactory
              processing in  insects by comparing theoretical predictions with actual 
              experimental results from insect neurobiology.  This model  incorporates novel
              features of simultaneous encoding of quality  and intensity, and of a network
              based on disinhibition (which has  been explored in other sensory systems). 
              Results will give  insights about the relative contributions of the synaptic
              inputs  from receptor neurons, antennal lobe neurons, and central  projection
              neurons, as they interact.     The importance of this work extends beyond
              insect olfaction to  understanding sensory signal processing in general, with
              potential  impact on other areas such as pest control, enhancement of 
              fragrances and flavors, and technology of designing artificial  chemical
              sensors.
