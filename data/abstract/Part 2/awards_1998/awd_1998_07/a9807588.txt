ABSTRACT

Sun, et. al.

This proposal brings together a
              highly interdisciplinary group of PIs to study the processing of algal carbon
              and nitrogen in sediments.  It is hypothesized that sediment reworking under
              three different mixing regimes - bioturbated, unmixed and episodically mixed -
              will have a direct effect on organic matter processing.  State of the art
              sediment geochemical techniques will be used to characterize the sediments and
              a large suite of biogeochemical tracers will be monitored in sediment mesocosms
              to which dual labeled (13C and 15N) algal material is added as a novel tracer
              of organic cycling.  Microbial community structure will also be followed using
              molecular biological techniques.  Oscillation of reactants between oxic and
              anoxic conditions is thought to be critical for organic matter degradation and
              nutrient cycling.  These oscillations can be triggered by natural events
              (storms, for example) and man made impacts (eutrophication, for example).  The
              results of the work will therefore have broad impact on our understanding of
              the health of the coastal ocean.

This proposal was part of the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry program.  It will be jointly funded by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences, Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, and the
              Division of Earth Sciences.
