Abstract    :
                 Hearing involves several centers, called nuclei, located in the brainstem,
              where auditory information is processed before being passed on to the midbrain
              and higher centers.  For many auditory signals, aspects of timing are very
              important.  Complex sounds, for example, often have a periodicity in their
              waveform that may be heard as a particular pitch, or frequency.  Anatomical
              studies suggest that one of the brainstem nuclei, called the ventral nucleus of
              the lateral lemniscus or VNLL, receives a large input from the one ear on the
              opposite side, from cell types that specifically transmit the temporal pattern
              of a sound.  This project uses a novel awake preparation for physiological
              recordings of nerve cells in the VNLL, to test whether the VNLL itself shows an
              orderly mapping of responses to pitch periodicity.  Results will be important
              because the VNLL has been so understudied in any mammals except for
              echolocating bats.
    The impact of this work will be important to
              understanding the role of this major nucleus in temporal pattern processing,
              and will also be important to help understand pitch-periodicity perception in
              humans, which in turn can be important in speech recognition, and could lead to
              improved electronics for speech processors and artificial intelligence (AI)
              networks.
