Instrumentation for Measuring Organic Aerosols in the Calspan
              Chamber


	This project supports measurements of polar organic compounds
              that will be studied as part of the Calspan cloud/aerosol experiment. The
              experiment will be conducted during November 1998, using the high-pressure
              Calspan chamber that is operated by the University of Rochester. The main
              science objective for the project is to improve understanding of the impact of
              organic aerosol precursors on the nucleation of new particles, particularly,
              internally mixed organic-inorganic particles.  The instrumentation package
              requested by the PI is in two parts.  In part one, the upgrade of the ion
              chromatography instrument will permit analysis of dissolved polar organic
              compounds such as carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids.  For part two, the PI
              requests support to upgrade the thermal evolution apparatus developed by T.
              Novakov (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory).  The thermal evolution system will be
              used to quantify the total carbon mass present in the particle and dissolved
              phases.  A graduate student from the University of Washington group will be
              trained on the thermal analysis system.  Thus, the project supports
              instrumentation that will permit a carbon mass balance to be developed for the
              Calspan cloud nucleation experiments.  The improved quantitative description of
              carbonaceous compounds in cloud-aerosol processes will provide experimental
              evidence that is intended to evaluate recent theoretical analyses on the impact
              of known organic compounds on cloud drops, and thus on climate forcing by
              aerosol chemical components.
