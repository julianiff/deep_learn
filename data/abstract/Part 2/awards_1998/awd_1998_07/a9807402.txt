Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998. 
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of animal
              physiology and conservation biology.  The research  and training plan is
              entitled the physiology of compromised  gamete production.  Many of the 37
              species within the  Felidae family consistently ejaculate high proportions of 
              subfertile sperm.  Although much is known about why  abnormally-shaped or even
              normal-appearing sperm from  teratospermic cats fail to fertilize oocytes,
              virtually  nothing is known about the physiological factors leading to 
              ejaculation of compromised sperm.  This project investigates  the endocrine,
              testicular and epididymal mechanisms leading  to the production of abnormal
              sperm.  Because a number of  members of this family are endangered, this
              information may  be useful in wildlife conservation and management.
