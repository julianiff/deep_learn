              ABSTRACT    OPP-9807051, 9806516  MCCARTNEY, HARRITT  UNIV. ARKANSAS, UNIV.
              ALASKA    This project addresses the regional integration of biological,
              ecological, social, and climatic data for better understanding the origins,
              development, and dynamics of native whaling and how whaling communities
              organize themselves to deal with the abundance of whale products when available
              and their scarcity when whale hunting fails.  The project will address four
              overarching interrelated goals: 1) reconstruction of climate fluctuations over
              the past two millennia with linkages to whale species and their numbers; 2)
              determination of native whale selection by species and size through the study
              of archeological whale bones, recently landed whales, and whale stock
              characteristics; 3) study of sociocultural variability of whaling and community
              organization; and 4) a focused examination of relations between prehistoric
              Siberian and Alaskan whale hunting groups around the Bering Strait.  This
              research takes into account the endangered nature of whales, threatened and
              damaged archeological sites, and elderly native whalers who have the greatest
              long-term knowledge about historic whaling.  Bowhead whales are federally
              protected due to their limited numbers, coastal archeological sites that
              contain whale bones and whale hunting technology are eroding at a rapid rate,
              and Eskimo elders often die of old age without having an opportunity to record
              their firsthand and long-term acquaintance with whaling and its social
              dimensions.
