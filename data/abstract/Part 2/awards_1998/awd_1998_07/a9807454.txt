Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at the
              University of Chicago will examine recent attempts in India to promote and
              broaden the use of spoken `Simple` Sanskrit.  While the classical Sanskrit
              language has been supported by authorities as a medium of scholarly and
              literary discourse, it recently has been promoted by political groups as a
              future lingua franca and emblem of a specifically Hindu nation.  Through
              careful ethnographic and linguistic study of two such projects in Karnataka, an
              organization in Bangalore which gives classes and promotes simple Sanskrit, and
              a model `Sanskrit-speaking village` in the central part of the state, the
              project will contribute to the literature on language death and revival.
              Methods include a formal linguistic analysis of the relation of spoken Sanskrit
              to Classical literary Sanskrit; an ethnographic study of how people in
              different speech communities gain competence in this new language, and an
              examination of the production of textual materials on the language's structure
              and use.  This project will provide information on a case of language revival
              for political goals that will be valuable for theory building when compared to
              other attempts such as Hebrew and Latin.  In addition the project will
              contribute to training a professional social scientist and add to our knowledge
              of this important region of the world.
