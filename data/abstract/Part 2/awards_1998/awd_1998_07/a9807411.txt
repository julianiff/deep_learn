Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9807411  Phoebe R. Johnson    This action funds an NSF
              Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998.    This fellowship
              supports research and training in the area  of  plant biology.  The research
              and training plan is  entitled HOOKLESS1 acetyltransferase in plant
              development:  determining function in vivo by identifying interacting 
              proteins, regulatory targets, and localization.  The  HOOKLESS1
              acetyltransferase is the first such enzyme to be  identified in the genetically
              tractable organism Arabidopsis  thaliana. Acetyltransferases have many diverse
              functions in  prokaryotes and eukaryotes, from hormone synthesis and drug 
              detoxification, to transcriptional regulation and chromatin  remodeling. Plants
              lacking HOOKLESS1 show developmental  abnormalities, providing an opportunity
              to determine how an  acetyltransferase regulates growth patterns in higher 
              plants.
