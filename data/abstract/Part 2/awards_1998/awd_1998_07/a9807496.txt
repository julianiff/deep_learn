Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              program supports research on hydrocarbon oxidation by organometallic  
              compounds by Dr. John E. Bercaw of the Chemistry Department, California  
              Institute of Technology.  Aqueous platinum halides, originally reported   by
              Shilov, will be studied.  The specific goals of the work are to   explore the
              mechanism of the C-H bond activation step in the Shilov   mechanism, prepare
              more active and robust compounds related to model   complexes that have been
              shown to effect C-H bond activation, prepare   some derivatives containing
              redox active groups, examine the reactions of   dioxygen with related Pt(II)
              compounds and seek ways to couple these   dioxygen reactions to the Shilov
              mechanism.  Understanding the   mechanistic steps resulting in hydroxylation of
              simple hydrocarbons will   help define the limitations of the Shilov system as
              well as provide   insight into how to achieve catalytic hydroxylation of
              hydrocarbons using   dioxygen as the oxidant.  Transition metal compounds are
              used extensively as catalysts in the   chemical industry.  This project focuses
              on the development of catalysts   for rapid and selective reaction of C-H bonds
              to form primary alcohols or   other partially oxidized products.   Such
              reactions could facilitate   using alkane feedstocks directly in subsequent
              chemical production.
