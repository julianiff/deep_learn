Abstract    :
              9807085  Cummings    This grant provides partial support of the acquisition cost
               of an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) for the Applied Mineralogy  Laboratory (AML)
              at Portland State University (PSU).  The  AML focuses on the identification and
              quantification of  minerals to solve environmental, geological, engineering, 
              agricultural, and industrial problems. The PI and Co-PI's,  Michael Cummings,
              Georg Grathoff, and Carl Palmer, in  addition to undergraduates, graduate
              students, faculty and  the Portland area scientific community will be the main 
              users of the new X-ray diffraction (XRD) unit.  The XRD will  be housed in the
              Geology Department and support teaching and  research in the Geology Department
              and the Environmental  Sciences and Resources Program. In the Geology
              Department  the XRD unit will be integrated into the geology  undergraduate and
              graduate curriculum.  Current research in  the Geology Department and the
              Environmental Sciences and  Resources Program include: adsorption of
              fertilizers onto  clay minerals, electrical conductivity of clay minerals in 
              soils, fingerprinting of debris flows, linking physical  properties of
              smectites to their atomic structure, and the  identification of phases
              associated with waste isolation and  aquifer remediation.  ***
