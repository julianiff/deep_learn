Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at Emory
              University will study the gender perspectives of men in a working class
              neighborhood of the Dominican Republic. While the island suffers relatively
              high rates of HIV infection, public health surveys have shown that Dominican
              women attribute high risk behavior to their partner's expectations.  This
              project will examine how men conceive of their norms of masculinity, sexuality
              and household responsibility. By combining demographic surveys of approximately
              500 households, structured interviews with about 300 men in two categories, HIV
              infected, and neighborhood residents, behavioral risk assessment and intensive
              ethnographic interviewing, the student (a native Spanish speaker) will assess
              the relationship between men's normative models of masculinity and specific
              patterns of sexual decision-making. The student will test various hypotheses
              about the relation of masculine reputations and other behaviors concerning
              household resources and role obligations. The results will be an important
              complement to the existing studies of gender roles and sexuality which tend to
              focus on women's behavior, and should be of interest for public health
              specialists interested in designing effective programs to prevent STDs.
