Abstract    :
              9807099  Kodama    This grant provides partial support for the cost of acquiring
              a  sensitive magnetic susceptibility/anisotropy system for the  paleomagnetics
              laboratory at Lehigh University.  The addition of  the
              susceptibility/anisotropy system at Lehigh University will  allow sensitive
              measurements of magnetic susceptibility and  anisotropy of magnetic
              susceptibility (AMS) by the PI (Kodama)  and his graduate students. These data
              will be important for  developing a technique to identify and correct
              inclination  shallowing of chemical remanent magnetizations (CRM) carried by 
              hematite in red beds. Detailed AMS measurements of natural red  bed samples and
              CRMs produced in the laboratory will be used in  conjunction with remanence
              anisotropy measurements to determine  empirical and test theoretical
              relationships between AMS and  remanence anisotropy. The results will be used
              to understand the  cause of anomalously shallow inclinations observed in
              Tertiary  and Cretaceous red beds from central Asia. AMS measurements will 
              also be important to a study initiated recently of the Nanaimo  Group sediments
              in Vancouver. The anomalously shallow  inclinations in these rocks have been
              used to provide support for  the Baja British Columbia hypothesis of major
              terrane motions  along the western margin of North America.  ***
