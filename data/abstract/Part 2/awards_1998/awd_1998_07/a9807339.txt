There is increasingly strong evidence that eyewitness
              identification of criminal suspects from lineups and photospreads is associated
              with two problems.  First, it occurs with surprising frequency and second, that
              false identifications are often associated with high levels of confidence on
              the part of the witness and this can lead jurors to accept the false
              identification as though it were accurate. Recent work by the PI indicates that
              confirming feedback not only produces inflation of confidence among those who
              have made false identifications, but also leads witnesses to exaggerate how
              good their view was of  the culprit, the amount of attention they paid during
              witnessing , how easily they were able to pick the person from the lineup and
              so on.  The current experiments will use the PIs post-identification feedback
              paradigm to test the hypothesis that the processes leading to confidence
              inflation are not conscious and re not easily reversed.  The experiments will
              test the effects of timing of feedback the type of feedback, the passage of
              time after feedback, and the accuracy of identification on eyewitnesses'
              reports of confidence, prior view, recollections of prior descriptions,
              attention ease of identification , and other eyewitness judgments.  In addition
              the research will assess mock-jurors' impressions of the testimony of the
              eyewitnesses as a function of the feedback manipulation .  The results will
              have significant implication for our understanding of how eyewitness confidence
              develops, why it changes, how confidence becomes dissociated form accuracy, and
              the implications for jurors' assessments of eyewitness credibility.
