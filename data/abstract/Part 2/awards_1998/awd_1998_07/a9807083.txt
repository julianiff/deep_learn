Traits expressed by species within a community
              reflect an integration of
selection pressures from a variety of biotic and
              abiotic sources.  This
project would integrate the different selective
              pressures imposed by both
herbivores and pollinators in evaluating the general
              features of plant
traits.  It will focus specifically on flower color, which
              has
traditionally been thought to respond primarily to pollinators.  This
              work
will investigate a California wild radish that exhibits three color
              morphs
and for which preliminary data indicate that antagonistic herbivores
              may be
exerting selective pressures on flower colors in addition to
              pollinator
responses.  Pollination and herbivory rates will be documented in
              field
studies of the three-color morphs that occur in the study area. 
              This
information will be combined with field and greenhouse experiments
              that
will examine herbivore preferences and plant performances relative
              to
color.  This work will illustrate how understanding the maintenance
              of
genetic diversity at microevolutionary scales can be related to
              the
generation of Biological diversity at macroevolutionary scales.
