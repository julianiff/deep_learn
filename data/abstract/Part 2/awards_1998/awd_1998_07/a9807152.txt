Abstract    :
              This is a study submitted through the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
              program. The project will add samples of Hmong and Cambodian refugees from
              different urban areas to an existing data base on minority identity among
              Southeast Asian refugees. The quantitative data base is a survey of 50 Hmong in
              a small, nearly all-white city and 50 Cambodians in a large, multicultural
              city. Even with control variables, the Hmong consistently have a stronger
              minority identity as measured by social distance, expectations of
              discrimination, and the belief that their group is disliked by native whites.
              The project seeks to determine if this difference is due to ethnicity or urban
              location. Qualitative data from follow-up interviews suggests that ethnicity is
              a cause of the variation. Cambodian ethnicity has fluid ethnic boundaries which
              leads to a weak sense of in- and out-group opposition. Hmong ethnicity has
              rigid ethnic boundaries which leads to a strong opposition between in- and
              out-groups. Fluid or rigid ethnic boundaries are due to (1) being a majority or
              minority group in the homeland, (2) one's view of the U.S. state in the Vietnam
              War, and (3) the role of ancestry in creating kinship groups. Obtaining samples
              of Hmong from a large, multicultural city and Cambodians from a small, nearly
              all-white city will provide the needed data to establish that homeland
              ethnicity can minimize or magnify the formation of a minority identity in the
              United States.
