Abstract    :
              9807043  MOLLER  The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
              research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support services
              to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea  to complete their
              investigations.  All of these ships use oceanographic cable and wire rope as
              part of this research support.  Arrangements have been made for bulk purchases
              of cable and wire rope for use be the UNOLS fleet which results in considerable
              cost savings.    Ten reels of cable, two reels of coaxial cable and eleven
              reels of wire rope will be purchased.  The reels are stored until needed at the
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography on the west coast.    Mr. Donald A. Moller,
              Marine Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project.  ***
