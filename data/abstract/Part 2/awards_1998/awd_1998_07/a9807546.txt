Abstract    :
                Robert Gallo  IBN 9807546    A decrease in the inhibitory influence of
              endogenous opioid  peptides on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion is important 
              in the regulation of the ovulatory LH surge.  This  suppression is postulated
              to be exerted by beta-endorphin  originating in arcuate nucleus neurons and
              acting via mu-  opioid receptors.  The potential involvement of other opioid 
              peptides and their receptors in "disinhibition" of the LH  surge has not been
              explored.  Recent work in Dr. Gallo's lab  suggests that reduction in medial
              preoptic area (MPOA) kappa-  opioid receptor-mediated inhibitory tone may be a
              critical  event in the generation of the LH surge.  This proposal has  two
              specific aims designed to clarify the mechanisms  underlying MPOA kappa-opioid
              receptor-mediated suppression  of the LH surge.  (1) Because dynorphin is the
              endogenous  ligand for the kappa-opioid receptor, the first aim will be  to
              determine which of the end products of prodynorphin  processing are the active
              ligands in the MPOA mediating  suppression of LH secretion.  (2) The second aim
              will be to  determine whether reduction in MPOA kappa-opioid receptor- 
              mediated suppression of the LH surge is due to a decrease in  the number of
              kappa-opioid receptors, the affinity of the  kappa receptors for its endogenous
              ligand, and/or the  synthesis of prodynorphin in the MPOA preceding the LH 
              surge.  These experiments will broaden our understanding of  the role of the
              prodynorphin family of opioid peptides in  reproductive neuroendocrine function
              by clarifying their  role in the mechanisms regulating the ovulatory LH surge.
