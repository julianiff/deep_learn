Abstract    :
              9807266  Hayes  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts provides support for operation of the National Ocean Sciences
              Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility.  This facility carries out analyses of
              carbon isotopes, particularly 14-C, for research in ocean, earth and
              atmospheric sciences. A major component of the analytical work during the
              initial three years of the award is expected to be water samples collected as
              part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), an international program
              to understand the circulation and structure of the world oceans.  In addition
              to WOCE samples, the facility carries out research in techniques for
              quantitative analysis of very small samples (to a minimum of 25 micrograms
              carbon, compared to standard AMS sample size of 300 micrograms) and
              compound-specific samples, which allows study of individual components of
              samples, and hence improved understanding of biogeochemical processes.  It also
              provides a facility for radiocarbon dating and study of carbon isotopes for the
              earth and ocean sciences community.  Major emphasis in the present award
              focuses on improving sample turnaround time, upgrading web-based information
              and sample submittal procedures, reducing maintenance time, improving system
              monitoring, improving sample throughput while maintaining high analytical
              precision, and increasing the total number of samples analyzed annually without
              increasing staffing levels. This award provides support for five years via a
              cooperative agreement, with a review of performance planned during the third
              year.  ***
