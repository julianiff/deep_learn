Abstract    :
              Herschel Rabitz is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to develop new techniques aimed at enabling chemists to
              control the outcome of a chemical reaction using a sequence of laser pulses. An
              external control field will be used to access quantum states of a chemical
              system that otherwise would not normally be reached without such intervention. 
              The general control principle consists of actively manipulating quantum wave
              interferences.  Optimal control theory provides the most general framework for
              achieving the molecular control objectives.  Real-time feedback from the
              experiment in progress coupled with learning control algorithms will be used to
              obtain the optimal pulse sequences for the desired outcome.  

Since the
              invention of the laser, chemists have dreamed of selectively exciting regions
              within a molecule thus causing a controlled chemical reaction to occur.   It
              was long ago realized, however, that intramolecular vibrational energy
              redistribution occurs so rapidly that it is impossible to concentrate enough
              energy in a selected bond to cause it to break.   Now, with the advent of laser
              pulse modulation techniques, and the application of control theory, it appears
              that the dream of laser selective chemistry may become a reality.
