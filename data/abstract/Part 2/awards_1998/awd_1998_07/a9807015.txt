Abstract    :
              9807015  Perlin    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration 
              between Drs. Kenneth Perlin and Robert Rowe of New York  University to work
              with Professor Jodo Antonio Zuffo at the  Laboratorio de Sistemas Integraveis
              da Escola Politecnica  (LSI-USP) at the University of Sao Paulo and with
              Professor  Mauricio V. Kritz at the Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao 
              Cientifica (LNCC) in Rio de Janeiro, as well as with  Professor Luiz Velho at
              Instituto de Matematica Pura e  Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil on multi-media
              research.  Specifically they will work with two major software  platforms, Pad
              and Improv, creating believable embodied  agents combining procedural animation
              techniques, behavioral  scripting, and distributed environments.  The
              Experimental  and Integrated Activities Program of the Computer and 
              Information Science and Engineering Division is providing  part of the support.
                 This collaboration continues a relationship among colleagues  from three
              labs in Brazil, which was started in 1992 by  Perlin.  Perlin's work with IMPA
              involves an investigation  of procedural multiresolution paint textures
              involving Pad,  which provides a mechanism to generate a large number of 
              details with a simple and compact representation.  With  LNCC, they are working
              on recursive hypergraph  representation to model interactions in biological
              systems.  NYU and LSI-USP are working on an integration of their  animation
              research with their work on multimodal input and  output devices.  The project
              will involve graduate students  from both sides in the collaboration.  ***
