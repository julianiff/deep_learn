Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at Harvard
              University.  The project will develop an historical and ethnographic account of
              food rationing and consumption practices in urban China.  It will demonstrate
              the process by which a socialist rationing system, in effect from 1953-1993,
              evolved, developed and transformed into a scheme of post-socialist welfare
              assistance.  The central hypothesis of the project is that individual
              strategizing subverted a rigid system of rationing and control and facilitated
              the system's final absorption into a market-oriented, capitalist economy.  The
              hypothesis will be tested through archival research and in-depth investigation
              of routine practices of food rationing.  During the project the student will
              systematically collect and examine official statistics, life stories and work
              histories. A detailed analysis of these data, both qualitative and
              quantitative, will help determine the extent to which everyday transactions in
              coupons under rationing served as a prologue to the revival of market
              competition and entrepreneurial behavior in post-Mao China.  The project will
              advance the anthropological understanding of the social meaning of money and
              exchange, enrich the existing literature on everyday life in socialist and
              post-socialist societies and contribute a fresh approach to the study of
              China's social and economic transition.
