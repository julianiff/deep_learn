Abstract    :
              Abstract - Knyazev      The kinetics and mechanisms of elementary reactions of
              chlorine and hydrogen atoms with chlorinated hydrocarbons is studied over a
              wide range of temperatures (300-800 K).  A discharge flow - resonance
              fluorescence (DF/RF) apparatus is constructed for this purpose.  Resonance
              fluorescence is chosen as the detection method because of its sensitivity and
              selectivity in detecting atoms.  Use of the RF/DF method makes it possible to
              isolate the reactions under study and to separate them from possible
              complications such as secondary atom-radical reactions.  The experimental
              kinetic results are analyzed using a transition-state/RRKM/master-equation
              approach to facilitate extrapolation to temperatures and pressures not
              accessible experimentally.    Use of combustion (incineration) for disposal of
              hazardous organic waste, including chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), has
              stimulated interest in the kinetics and mechanisms of this process.  The
              reactions of chlorine atoms and hydrogen atoms with the principal CHC compounds
              - the subject of this study - are among the most important and sensitive
              reactions involved.  These reactions have relevance to chemical processing and
              flame inhibition/fire retardancy as well.
