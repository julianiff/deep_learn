Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ofer Bar- Yosef and a 
              large multinational group of collaborators will  continue National Science
              Foundation supported  archaeological  research at the site of Hayonim Cave
              located in Israel. Hayonim  contains deposits  rich in lithics and faunal
              remains - as well as  fragmentary human skeletal material - which span the 
              time range  of ca 160,000 - 120,000 years ago. Excavation and analysis will 
              proceed with a series of related goals.  Materials will be collected for
              thermoluminescence and  electron  spin resonance dating of the deposits. If
              successful this will  provide absolute age  estimates. Extensive exposure of
              layer E, the lowest level of the site will permit recording and examination of
              hearths  and spatial distributions of artifacts and bones. Each of these 
              classes will be analyzed. Reseachers will reconstruct the lithic  operational
              sequences employed for tool manufacture and microwear  analysis will be
              conducted to determine tool function.      Data from a number of sources
              suggest that anatomically and  behavioral modern humans first appeared in
              Africa perhaps 200,000 years ago and spread sequentially to other parts of the
              world.  The Near East, as the gateway from Africa may provide essential 
              information on this expansion. Work to date indicates that for a long  span of
              time both modern humans and earlier `Neanderthal` forms  either coexisted or
              alternated presence in the area. Just when  the first modern humans arrived
              however is unknown and Dr. Bar  Yosef's research directly examines the
              suspected period. Hayonim  cave is worthy of concerted research because its
              deposits not  only cover this time range but also contain well preserved faunal
               and lithic remains. This research is important for several reasons. It will
              provide  data of interest to a large number of anthropologists. It will  shed
              light on the emergence of modern humans and increase our  knowledge of a little
              understood period of time.
