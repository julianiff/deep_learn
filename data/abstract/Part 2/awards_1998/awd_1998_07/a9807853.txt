Abstract    :
                9807853  Shareef  An SGER award supports cooperative studies between Bradley 
              University and Caterpillar, Inc. under the GOALI program.  The purpose is to
              develop analytical solutions for the  elastohydrodynamic conditions in the
              cam/roller contact  system, where unusual challenges exist due to high friction
               and contact load and significant surface roughness, and  where conditions
              continually change during the operation  cycle.  The analytical work will be
              supplemented with post-  mortem analyses of the nature of the damage to actual
              cams  and the locus of the damage initiation, combined with  simulation tests
              in a test rig to be constructed at  Caterpillar.  ***
