Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF)  will assist the Department of Chemistry at The   University of Florida
              to acquire an upgrade of an existing 500 MHz NMR   Spectrometer. This equipment
              will permit the study of a variety of molecules,   including organometallics,
              molecules of biochemical interest, and both   natural and synthetic
              macromolecules.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
