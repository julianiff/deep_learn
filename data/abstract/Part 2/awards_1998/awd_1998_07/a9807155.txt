Abstract    :
              The traditional theory of resource conservation in the third world was that
              local communities existed in equilibrium with their natural resources when they
              were peripheral or uninvolved with a commercial market, but that once they were
              involved more significantly with a market this caused them to overexploit their
              natural resources.  This research involves the dissertation project of an
              anthropology student from the University of Florida, who will study the
              relationship between market integration and natural resource conservation and
              evaluation among small farmers in highland Peru.   Using methods of participant
              observation, surveys, as well as an experimental agricultural plot, the student
              will analyze the behavior and cognitive models of natural resources of farmers
              in the Callejon de Huaylas, to test the hypothesis that traditional knowledge
              loss is a direct function of market involvement.  This research is important
              because the case study will advance our understanding of the long-term effects
              of market production in agrarian societies, while at the same time increasing
              our understanding of this important region of the world and contributing to the
              training of a young scientist.
