Abstract    :
              9807100  Brown, Wes    Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of animals is a small,
              extrachromosomal genome  typically about 16 kilobases and containing 37 genes. 
              MtDNA comparisons  among major animal groups suggest several generalities: 1)
              With the  exception of some cnidarian mtDNAs, and otherwise for a single 
              protein-encoding gene (ATP8), gene content is invariant, consisting of 37 
              genes. 2) Gene arrangements commonly remain unchanged over long periods of 
              evolutionary time. 3) There is little selection for particular gene 
              arrangements. 4) The great number of potential gene rearrangements makes 
              convergence in different lineages unlikely. 5) With few exceptions, gene 
              arrangements seem stable within major groups, but variable between them.  All
              of these characteristics make the comparison of mitochondrial gene 
              arrangements a powerful means for inferring ancient phylogenetic 
              relationships. From these comparisons we have been able to infer several 
              higher level evolutionary relationships for which all other types of data  had
              been equivocal. We intend to determine the complete mitochondrial DNA 
              sequences and gene arrangements of an animal representing each of the 
              following groups: The crustacean groups Remipedia and Maxillopoda,  Myriapoda,
              Pentastoma, Priapula, Phoronida, Ectoprocta, the brachiopod  groups Articulata
              and Inarticulata, the mollusk groups Cephalopoda and  Scaphopoda, the annelid
              groups Polychaeta and Hirudinea, Pogonophora,  Sipuncula, Echiura, Nematoda,
              and Platyhelminthes. We will compare these  cladistically, along with many
              published gene arrangements, as well as  compare DNA and inferred amino acid
              sequences in order to infer  evolutionary relationships among higher metazoan
              groups.
