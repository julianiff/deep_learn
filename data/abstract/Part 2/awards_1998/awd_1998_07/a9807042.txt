Abstract    :
              This award is made to Northwestern University in support of the   collaborative
              research of Prof. R.P.H. Chang and Prof. Tobin Marks by the   Advanced
              Materials Program in the Chemistry Division, The Solid-State   Chemistry
              Program in the Division of Materials Science and the Physical   Foundations of
              Enabling Technology  Program in the Division of Electrical   and Communication
              Systems. The focus of the research will be the growth    of metal oxide
              superconductor/insulator thin film heterostructures using   atomic layer
              epitaxy. Organometallic precursors will be designed and   synthesized to
              provide contiguous self sealing pinhole-free films. Pulsed   organometallic
              beam epitaxy will be used to fabricate cuprate   superconducting oxide
              superlattices on insulator(SIS) or normal metal   oxide(SNS)  heterostructure
              junctions. under a variety of experimental   conditions. Scanning electron
              microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy,   atomic force microscopy, ion
              scattering spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction   and Auger spectroscopy will be
              used to characterize the films and   interfaces. Collaborations with several
              companies to fabricate and   characterize junction devices are in place. 
              Multilayer high temperature superconductor-based heterostructure junction  
              devices are of current interest for microwave circuitry. The precise   control
              of superconducting thin film composition, morphology and epitaxy   provided by
              this research will enhance the performance of such devices.
