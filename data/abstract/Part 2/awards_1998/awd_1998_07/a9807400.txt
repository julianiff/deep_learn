Abstract    :
              Abstract      DBI-9807400  Luis F. Santana    This action funds an NSF Minority
              Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998.    This fellowship supports
              research and training in the area  of animal physiology.  The research and
              training plan is  entitled regulation of arterial diameter by subcellular 
              calcium release events.  Local calcium release events  ("calcium sparks")
              through ryanodine receptors in the  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of vascular
              smooth muscle  indirectly cause arterial dilation by activating calcium- 
              sensitive potassium (Kca) channels. Activation of Kca  channels causes
              hyperpolarization, closing voltage-dependent  calcium channels and thereby
              decreasing global cellular  calcium, which causes vasodilation. The goal of
              this  research is to examine how the SR protein phospholamban, by  regulating
              SR calcium, modulates calcium sparks, membrane  voltage and diameter of
              myogenic arteries.
