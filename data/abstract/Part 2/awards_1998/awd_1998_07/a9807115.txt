This research
              will link two key ecological processes that until now have been treated as
              conceptually distinct phenomena: dispersal dynamics of mobile animals in a
              patchy landscape, and the effects of seed consumers on tree regeneration in
              forested landscapes.  The primary goals are to (1) determine whether
              populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) demonstrate source-sink
              dynamics in the patchy, postagricultural landscapes of northeastern U.S. and
              (2) reveal the consequences of dispersal patterns by mice (whether source-sink
              or an alternative model) for the survival of tree seeds and ultimately for
              forest regeneration.  This will allow for linkage of animal dispersal dynamics
              with community dynamics of plants. Three landscape patch types will be studied:
              oak-dominated forests, maple-dominated forests, and shrub- and herb-dominated
              oldfields. All three patch types are connected to one another along extensive,
              sharp edges, and mice occupy all three patch types. It is hypothesized that oak
              patches support source populations in post-acorn-mast years, during which maple
              and oldfield patches are sinks and the PIs will: (1) measure the net direction
              of dispersal between patch types; (2) estimate the mean fitness within
              populations in each patch type, using direct measurements of mortality and
              natality; and (3) enclose populations and follow growth trajectories in the
              patch type (oldfield). Together, these approaches will distinguish source-sink
              dynamics from alternative models.
