Abstract    :
              9807287  Stewart  The objective of this project is to create responsive
              hydrogels by crosslinking synthetic water-soluble polymers with
              well-characterized protein domains.  These hydrogels will be unique because
              their environmental responsiveness will be determined or modulated by the
              protein crosslinks, which may give the hydrogels properties particularly useful
              for controlled drug delivery applications.  This project could lead to a new
              class of hydrogels with novel responses to environmental stimuli; responses
              that can be fine-tuned using molecular genetics to adjust the crosslink
              structure.  In the area of drug delivery, the greatest impact of
              titin-crosslinked hydrogels may be their potential as pulsed-release drug
              carriers.  Whereas most current approaches for pulsed drug delivery require an
              external signal to trigger drug release, a hydrogel with a stepped swelling
              transition would result in a periodic rise and fall of drug release as a result
              of the intrinsic chemical and physical properties of the hydrogel.  ***
