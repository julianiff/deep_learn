Abstract    :
                This study will be the first to document how the concentrations of two
              hormones, testosterone and cortisol, are related to the social behavior and
              nutritional plane of wild chimpanzees.  We will study two wild populations of
              chimpanzees (in Kibale National Park, Uganda; and Gombe National Park,
              Tanzania), living in habituated communities that each contain about 10 adult
              males.  In each site we will collect urine from individuals in trees and freeze
              it for later analysis.  We will also make systematic observations of the social
              behavior of adult chimpanzees, including rates of aggression and submission,
              sexual behavior, and alliances.  We will then find out whether (as in our pilot
              study) testosterone and dominance are consistently related to each other among
              adult male chimpanzees, and if so, how both are also related to the frequency
              of aggression.  We will also establish how levels of sexual behavior are
              related to both hormones, how hormonal levels change in response to group
              composition, and how they are related to seasonal fluctuations in food supply. 
              By analyzing the relationship between hormones and aggression in wild
              chimpanzees, this study will contribute to understanding the evolution and
              function of the parallel system in humans.
