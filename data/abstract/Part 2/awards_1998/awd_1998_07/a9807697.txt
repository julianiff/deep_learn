Abstract    :
              9807697
Gaillard  The overall objective of this project is to determine the
              influence of microbial processes on the chemical speciation of metals in
              sediments, i.e., to evaluate how bacterial defense mechanisms, in response to a
              metal stress, affect the chemistry of metals in sediments.  The project will be
              conducted in two phases. The first phase will consist in investigating the
              chemistry and microbiology of contaminated freshwater sediments. Along a
              contamination gradient, the microbial ecology of three sites, as well as their
              complete geochemical characterization, will be performed using molecular tools.
              The second phase will consist in laboratory experiments where natural
              sedimentary microbial populations will be submitted to Zn stress. The pore
              waters and the microbial communities will be monitored as a function of
              exposure time to determine if metal stress results in community changes and the
              liberation of specific ligands that complex the metal. Concurrently, the
              changes in the local molecular environment of the metal, in the sediment
              particles, will be probed using X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure.  The expected
              result of this research is a better understanding of the processes that are
              controlling the physical and chemical form of metals in contaminated sediments.
              In addition, it should pro-vide new evidence on the key role played by
              microorganisms in the biogeochemical cycles of metals in aquatic environments.
