Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at
              Princeton University will conduct an ethnographic study of the world views and
              rhetoric of investment bankers and other actors on Wall Street (including
              popular media representations as well as the local personnel). The project will
              analyze `Wall Street's` views of the sweeping social and economic changes
              occurring through corporate restructuring and changing global employment
              patterns and wealth concentrations. The particular focus is the construction of
              Wall Street rhetoric which makes restructuring and downsizing and the social
              and economic upheavals they create seem legitimate and necessary in the name of
              efficiency.  The student, who previously worked in an investment bank, will
              conduct general participant observation and structured interviewing on views in
              general and on one particular event in particular, to capture the multiple and
              competing world views and actions and shed light on the actual struggles and
              power relations involved in a case of downsizing, instability and inequality. 
              The project will make an important connection between the understandings and
              actions of Wall Street actors and the social relations in which the actors are
              engaged, and will contribute to understanding `global capitalism` by exploring
              the relationships between world view and economic behavior.
