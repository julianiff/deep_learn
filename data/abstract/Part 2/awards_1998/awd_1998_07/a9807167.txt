Abstract    :
              There is a number of emerging scientific issues in electronic commerce that bear
              examination in the context of a workshop, to determine whether and how NSF
              should support near- and medium-term future research in the area.  Some of
              these issues include the development of trust, potentially supported by new
              technologies, dynamic but limited-information assessments of quality; automated
              contracting, intermediation, tractable algorithms for electronic markets, and
              the links between electronic commerce and the building of relationships,
              including communities, organizations, etc.  This workshop will survey and
              identify strategic, timely and pressing research areas in the application of
              information infrastructure to commerce; develop a set of research priorities;
              build consensus on how the various research components of electronic commerce
              can best be leveraged against one another and collaborations built; and
              disseminate the results widely.
