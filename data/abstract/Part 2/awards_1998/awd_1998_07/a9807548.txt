Abstract    :
                 A fundamental property of most visual systems is directional  sensitivity, in
              which objects moving one direction are quickly  discriminated from objects
              moving in an opposite direction.  The  cellular mechanisms for this property
              are largely unknown.  This  collaborative research project brings together the
              skills of a  physiologist and an ultrastructural anatomist in a 
              multidisciplinary approach involving electrophysiology,  biochemistry,
              computational neuroscience and electron microscopy.  Using the well-studied
              visual system of crayfish as a model, this  project tests a novel hypothesis
              that excitatory and inhibitory  effects of two different neurotransmitter
              compounds can be  integrated by the same excitable membrane channel.  The
              technical  difficulties give the project a high level of risk, but the 
              potentially very high impact of the results, along with the  experience  and
              skills of the PIs, make taking the risk  worthwhile.     Results will be
              important beyond simply invertebrate vision, to  understanding a fundamental
              property of visual systems, and to  clarifying a cellular mechanism of
              integration important to all  neuroscience as well as to cell physiology.
