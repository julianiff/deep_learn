This proposal uses lead smelting in the oak-hickory forests of
              SE Missouri as a natural laboratory for studying the groundwater mobility,
              speciation and bioavailability of Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn.  The P.I.s' preliminary
              work shows that the isotope composition of lead washed from leaf surfaces maps
              the fallout of particulate lead around the smelter.  Residual lead from inside
              plant leaves represents Pb from the soil; initial isotope data and high Pb
              concentrations inside the leaves strongly suggest that smelter Pb is
              groundwater soluble, mobile and bioavailable.  Thus, the widely recognized
              ecosystem and human health hazards of particulate Pb may set the stage for more
              subtle, but more widespread, effects due to mobilization of anthropogenic Pb in
              groundwater and its biomagnification.  The P.I.s propose to address the
              redistribution and bioavailability of Pb through studies of atmospheric
              deposition, an ecosystem audit, studies of biological isotope fractionation,
              and theoretical models of speciation and transport.  Undergraduate classes in
              the Departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Chemical Engineering and
              Biology will participate in field, analytical and theoretical work.  High
              school students will be involved in all phases, through the NSF Young Scholar's
              Program.

This proposal was part of the Environmental Geochemistry and
              Biogeochemistry program.  It will be jointly funded by the Division of
              Atmospheric Sciences, Division of Chemistry, Division of Earth Sciences, and by
              the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
