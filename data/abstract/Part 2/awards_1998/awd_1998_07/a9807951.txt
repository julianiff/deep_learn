Abstract    :
              9807951  Kurz    This grant provides three years of partial salary support for
              the  Isotope Geochemistry Facility technician at Woods Hole  Oceanographic
              Institution (Mr. D. Lott).  This is a phase I  technician support grant under
              the Instrumentation and Facilities  Program (Earth Sciences).  Lott will have
              responsibility for  maintenance, training, and technical support associated
              with the  thermal ionization and noble gas mass spectrometers, under the 
              supervision of Dr. M. Kurz.  Lott has considerable experience in  developing
              cryogenic systems that are necessary for separating  the noble gases from one
              another prior to mass spectrometry.  This laboratory has excellent capabilities
              for helium, but is  increasingly focused on measurement of the heavier noble
              gases  (Ar and Xe). Lott will therefore devote some of his effort to 
              developing new methodologies for cryogenically separating the  heavy noble
              gases, in addition to training of graduate students  and supervision of day to
              day laboratory operations.  His  presence in the laboratory will insure that
              the instrumentation  remains state-of-the-art, and that the technical
              capabilities are  widely used.  The areas of research, that will benefit, cross
               many disciplinary boundaries, ranging from surface exposure  dating of glacial
              deposits to mantle geochemistry.  There is a  large community of geochemists at
              Woods Hole who will also  directly benefit from the technical support.  ***
