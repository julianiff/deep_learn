Abstract    :
              Hedrick  9807490  Endangered species face many threats including loss of
              habitat, non-native predators, and hunting. One of the major factors causing
              the reduction of endangered species are parasites (defined broadly as viruses,
              bacteria, and other infectious agents). Parasites may have a greater impact
              when an endangered species is reduced to marginal habitat, has lost genetic
              variation, or becomes inbred from having small or isolated populations. Here we
              examine the impact of a non-native parasite on the endangered Gila and Yaqui
              topminnows. The Gila topminnow is found only in nine native locations in
              Arizona and the Yaqui topminnow only on the San Bernadino Wildlife Refuge in
              southeastern Arizona. The Gila topminnow has been the subject of extensive
              examination both genetically and ecologically. In particular, variation at a
              major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, genes thought to be involved in
              parasite resisitance in all vertebrates, has been characterized.     In this
              research we will examine whether different populations of the these topminows
              have different resistance to a non-native parasitic fluke and whether
              differences are related to variation in the MHC locus. In addition we will
              examine whether inbred fish have a different susceptibility to the parasite
              than non-inbred fish. In this way we will be able to determine the genetic
              mechanisms influencing parasite resistance in this endangered species, generate
              a model for examining such threats in endangered species and directly address
              potential treats in these two endangered species.
