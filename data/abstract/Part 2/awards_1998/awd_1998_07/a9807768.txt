Title: The Very
              Stable Boundary Layer

The purpose of this project is to improve our
              understanding of the exchange of heat, moisture, momentum, and contaminants
              between the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere when the atmospheric layer
              near the ground is extremely stable.  In these conditions, the variation of the
              wind with height and time and the vertical transport of heat and other material
              by the atmosphere do not conform to the theories appropriate for daytime
              conditions.  During the day surface heating causes the air next to the ground
              to become unstable, leading to convection, well developed turbulence,
              predictable profiles of temperature, wind velocity, and humidity, and therefore
              predictable vertical fluxes of heat and water vapor.  But at night the surface
              is cold, the air stable, and the turbulence often intermittent and caused by
              vertical wind shear associated with terrain-induced drainage flows.  The
              approach is to analyze existing data from twelve different field programs,
              which represent different kinds of terrain and climatic conditions, to
              determine new ways to express the fluxes in terms of wind speed, surface
              temperature, and other known quantities.  The study will compare the
              observations with existing theories, seek ways of improving the theories, and
              assess the importance of turbulence induced by elevated shear layers in
              transporting material down to the ground.  The result of the research will be
              an improved formulation of the very stable boundary layer for use in large
              scale
