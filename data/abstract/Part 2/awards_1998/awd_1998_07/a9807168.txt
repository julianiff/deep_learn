Abstract    :
              Maderson  9807168         Participants in the proposed meeting hosted by the 
              Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) will  discuss the
              controversial subject of the evolution of flying  bipedal vertebrates from
              their quadrapedal ancestors.  The  participants will consider the current data
              from functional  to molecular levels in the contect of systematics, 
              biomechanics and physiology of extant and fossil forms.  The  format will allow
              the audience to submit written questions  which will be discussed in
              round-table format.  The papers  and the question/answer session will be
              published.
