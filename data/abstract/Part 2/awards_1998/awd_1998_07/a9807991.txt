                     LAY ABSTRACT           Selection  and Generation of Rhythmic Motor
              Patterns by  the  Spinal           Cord            IBN-9807991            
              Animals, including human beings, are constantly making behavioral        
              choices. Some of these behavioral choices may involve conscious        
              deliberation, but others occur automatically. In vertebrate         animals,
              the spinal cord mediates limb movements. In some cases,         the spinal cord
              can select an appropriate limb movement for each of         several situations,
              even in the absence of inputs from the brain.         The turtle spinal cord,
              in particular, can appropriately select and         generate several types of
              hindlimb movements on its own. This makes         the turtle spinal cord an
              excellent "model system" to investigate         how "circuits" of nerve cells
              can produce an appropriate behavior         in vertebrates. The research
              performed under this NSF grant will         address the general question, Does
              the selection and generation of         movements depend mainly on the activity
              of individual nerve cells         that are specialized for one type of movement
              or instead depend         mainly on the activity of an interacting network of
              nerve cells,         each of which contributes to multiple types of movements?
              This         research will also test specific hypotheses about how the nerve   
                   cells in the turtle spinal cord are connected to one another to        
              select and generate three types of a behavior termed "scratching,"         as
              well as two types of swimming. This research will contribute to         our
              understanding of mechanisms of behavioral choice in vertebrates         and to
              our understanding of the spinal cord control of limb         movements. In
              addition, this research will provide training to         graduate students in
              the design and execution of experiments         involving neurophysiology and
              neuroanatomy.
