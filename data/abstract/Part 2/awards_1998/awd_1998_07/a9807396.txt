Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1998. 
              This fellowship supports research and training in the area  of  population
              biology.  The research and training plan is  entitled can parasites explain the
              maintenance of sexual  recombination?  Theoretical models suggest that sexual 
              recombination is advantageous because it breaks gene  associations fixed by
              past selection, allowing organisms to  adapt to their present environment. 
              This project  investigates if parasite selection causes gene associations, 
              whether sexual recombination increases resistance to  parasites and whether
              different parasites select for similar  or different host genotypes.  This
              research can help  determine the importance of genetic diversity to coevolution
               and the development of agricultural and conservation  policies.
