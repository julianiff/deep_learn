Abstract    :
              9807284  Ho  This is a grant in support of theoretical research to study  a wide
              range of new dilute quantum gas systems which have  been made possible by
              recent experiments at JILA and MIT.  These new quantum systems include
              Boson-Fermion mixtures,  spinor Boson condensates, large spin Fermion systems,
              spinor  Boson-Boson mixtures, and spinor Boson-Fermion mixtures.  Some of these
              systems have been realized in the laboratory,  while others are the focus of
              current attention.  These  systems will be studied using techniques developed
              recently  to study mixtures of Bose condensates and to study the  hydrodynamics
              of single component Bose condensates.  %%%  This is a grant in support of
              theoretical research to study  a wide range of new dilute quantum gas systems
              which have  been made possible by recent experiments at JILA and MIT.  These
              experiments have, for the first time, been able to  create a new state of
              matter, the Bose-Einstein condensate,  which was predicted many years ago.  The
              work done here will  investigate a variety of these condensates.  ***
