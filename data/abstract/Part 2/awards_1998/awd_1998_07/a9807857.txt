Abstract    :
              9807857  RAO   This conference, which will take place September  6th-10th, 1998
              in Beijing, China, will integrate principles that  are of general interest to
              molecular and cellular neurobiologists,  and encourage interactions of
              neurobiologists from different but  related fields.  The conference topics are
              arranged around five  themes:  1) neuronal cell fate and differentiation, 2)
              neuronal  survival and neurotrophic factors, 3) axonal guidance and path 
              finding, 4) synapse development and plasticity, and 5) signal  transduction in
              the nervous system.  Participants will be from the  US and Asian countries
              including China, Japan, Singapore, and  Taiwan.  The conference is planned as
              the first of a series  jointly run by the Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) in
              the US and  the Xiangsan Science Conferences (XSC) in China.  It will combine 
              the scientific excellence of the GRC and the strength of XSC in  organizing
              conferences in Asia.  It will provide a unique  opportunity for scientists from
              the US and Asia to communicate  scientific findings and to explore new areas of
              international  collaborations.  The meeting will provide unique opportunities
              for  junior Asian neuroscientists to interact with leading  neurobiologists in
              the world, and could have major impact on Asia-  US scientific exchanges.
