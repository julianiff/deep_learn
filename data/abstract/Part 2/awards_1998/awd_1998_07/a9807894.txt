Abstract    :
              IBN 98-07894  RANE      The cells of the nervous system ("neurons") acquire the 
              capability for generating electrical impulses in response to  biological
              molecules known as "growth factors". Growth factors are  proteins produced
              naturally by the nervous system and the tissues  which it controls. When growth
              factors contact neurons, they evoke  a series of yet undetermined chemical
              events, which cause the  neurons to produce other proteins called ion channels.
              These ion  channels are part of the neuron's structure, and they give it the 
              ability to generate electrical signals. In addition to causing  long-term
              induction of ion channels, growth factors also generate  chemical signals which
              have immediate effects on ion channels  already present in the cell. Because
              virtually all nervous  function is dependent on the electrical signals
              generated by ion  channels, it is critical to understand channel regulation by 
              growth factors and growth-factor-generated chemical signals. Dr.  Rane and
              colleagues will use several techniques, including  cellular patch clamp
              electrophysiology, genetics, and  pharmacology, to investigate these issues.
              The work will delineate  the actions of growth factors and
              growth-factor-mediated signaling  in governing the electrical behavior of nerve
              cells, and thus the  functioning of the nervous system.
