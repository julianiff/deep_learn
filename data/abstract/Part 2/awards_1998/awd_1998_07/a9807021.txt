Abstract    :
              9807021  Banerjee    Funds awarded by NSF to the Institute for Rock Magnetism
              (IRM)  will be matched (50% basis) by the University of Minnesota to  acquire
              two new instruments, a Magnetic Property Measurement  System (MPMS) and an
              Alternating Field Demagnetizer, and upgrade  two current instruments, a
              Mossbauer Spectrometer and an  Alternating Gradient Force Magnetometer (AGFM,
              also known as  "Micromag"). The IRM is a national facility for advanced
              in-house  and extramural research in fundamental rock magnetism and its 
              applications to research in tectonics, stratigraphy, marine  geology and
              geophysics, past climatic and environmental change  and bio-mineralization. 
              The new equipment will result in a  significant increase in the capability to
              identify and quantify  very low concentrations (100ppm or greater) of the
              oxides,  hydroxides, carbonates and sulfides of iron present in  continental
              and marine sediments.  These minerals serve as  sensitve indicators of
              geological processes icluding changes in  the geomagnetic field, plate tectonic
              motions, microbial  mineralization and climatic change.  ***
