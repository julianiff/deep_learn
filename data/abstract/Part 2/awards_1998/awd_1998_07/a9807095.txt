Abstract    :
                9807095  Wang, Leon R.    This project supports a US-China-Japan Trilateral 
              Symposium/Workshop on Lifeline  Earthquake Engineering is to  be held in
              Kunming China in 1998.  This activity follows  previous meetings in 1990 and
              1994.  The project provides a  timely forum for scientist and earthquake
              engineers of the  three countries to exchange the research results and to 
              review the state-of-the-art knowledge and techniques for  seismic designs and
              safety of engineering lifeline systems.  The meeting will also further
              collaborations  for future  research on cost-effective lifeline protection
              measures and  implementation of research results into designing standards  for
              practical applications. Proceedings will be published on  widely distributed. 
              This meeting is jointly organized by  Old Dominion University, State
              Seismological Bureau (SSB) of  China and Kobe University in Japan.  This
              project is  supported under the US/PRC Protocol Annex III Program.  ***
