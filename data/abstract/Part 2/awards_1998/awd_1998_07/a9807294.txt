Abstract    :
              PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY  PANTANO  EEC-9807294    This award provides
              funding to Pennsylvania State University to determine if  there is sufficient
              industrial support for this university to become a  research site of the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  (I/UCRC) on Glass Research,
              based at Alfred University.  The work at Penn  State would focus on glass
              surfaces, which will complement the research  currently performed at Alfred
              University on glass and glass manufacturing.  Research on glass surfaces is of
              interest because the surface of a  manufactured glass product often dictates
              many of the properties important  to such products, including strength,
              corrosion, weathering resistance,  cleanliness, scratch resistance, and optical
              reflectivity.  Additionally,  glass products may be mated or bonded to other
              materials such as deposited  thin films for solar control and metal coatings
              for optics.  During  manufacturing, the surface of the glass must withstand a
              variety of chemical  and physical properties for cleaning, etching, polishing
              and plasma  treatments.  Thus, an understanding of glass surfaces and
              interfaces is  essential to both the science and technology of glass.
