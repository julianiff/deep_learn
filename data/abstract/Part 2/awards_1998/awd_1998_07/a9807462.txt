Abstract    :
              Environmental degradation is a critical issue in resource management and
              development projects.  Historically, population increase coupled with poverty
              has been thought to create a `downward spiral` that traps the rural poor in the
              third world in an ever worsening struggle for survival. This dissertation
              research project by a cultural anthropology student at Southern Methodist
              University will examine the relationship between poverty, expanding population
              and land use in two Philippine communities. The two agricultural communities
              differ in degree of market integration, income and poverty levels, but have
              similar land use strategies and occupy the same ecological niche.  An explicit
              comparison between the land use strategies will allow the researcher to isolate
              the relevant variables that determine land use decisions and their impact on
              the environment.  Methods will include semi-structured ethnographic interviews,
              decision analyses, consensus analysis, mapping of agricultural plots, life
              histories and archival research. This project will advance our understanding of
              the political economic underpinnings of environmental degradation and will be
              helpful to decision makers concerned with the actual relationships of the rural
              poor to their environment.
