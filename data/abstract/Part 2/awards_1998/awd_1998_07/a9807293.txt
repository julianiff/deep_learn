Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9807293  KOMISTEK    An important need exists to improve the
              understanding of the musculoskeletal system of the human body to be able to
              design and manufacture implants that mimic human notions.  Research with
              computers, engineering analysis, and simulation and engineering design
              techniques could contribute to better health and be valuable to rehabilitation
              and manufactures of implants.  The Colorado School of Mines in collaboration
              with the Rose Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory and the University of
              Colorado's Medical School held an industry/university planning meeting on
              February 27 and 28, 1997 to determine the economic viability of forming an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Musculoskeletal System
              Analysis.  As a result of the planning meeting (NSF Grant EEC-9616415), the
              Center has raised approximately $1M from industry and other sources.    The
              I/UCRC research agenda included the study of kinematics of joints,
              concentrating on the knee with projects on "Image-Based Sensing", Portable
              Sensing Systems", "Modeling and Simulation" and "Advanced Biomaterials."
