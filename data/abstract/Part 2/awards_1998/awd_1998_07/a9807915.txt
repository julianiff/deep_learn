Abstract    :
              Greenfield  9807915      In mate choice, females select mates from which they
              may                             obtain  1) resources that directly enhance
              their reproductive success  and/or 2) "good" genes that are expressed in their
              offspring.  While these two mechanisms are not incompatible, their  relative
              contributions to sexual selection are not known.  Moreover, female choice based
              on genetic factors assumes  substantial genetic variation underlying certain
              male  trait(s), but the maintenance of such genetic variation is  poorly
              understood. These problems remain because sexual  selection has often been
              studied in species that are not  amenable to controlled laboratory experiments
              and genetic  analyses. Previous work by Dr. Michael Greenfield indicates  that
              an unusual pyralid moth, Achroia grisella, is an  excellent subject for
              studying mate choice. Female choice in  A. grisella is based on discrimination
              of male ultrasonic  signals. In this project Greenfield will employ a variety
              of  breeding experiments, and field observations to 1) test  potential sources
              of the genetic variation in selected male  traits, and 2) determine the
              relative importance of the two  mechanisms.         Findings will contribute to
              our basic knowledge of  acoustic signaling and perception and provide a
              uniquely  thorough assessment of the ways in which traits used for mate  choice
              evolve. Because A. grisella is a minor pest of  honeybees (its common name is
              the lesser wax moth), such  information should also prove useful in the
              management of  this and other more harmful insect pests.
