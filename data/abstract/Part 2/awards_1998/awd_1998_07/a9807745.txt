Abstract    :
              9807745  Schimmelmann    This ESH project will examine fine-grained laminae
              derived  from floods in sediment cores from the Santa Barbara Basin,  as a
              tracer of extreme precipitation periods during the last  5000 years.  Sediment
              analysis including X-radiography,  particle size distribution and clay
              mineralogy will be used  to distinguish flood deposits from distal turbidites. 
              Radiocarbon dating will be used to produce a chronology of  the flood events,
              and the resulting record will be compared  with other regional climate records,
              such as tree-ring  indices, to interpret the long-term record of climate change
               in southern California at annual, decadal, and century-scale  resolution.
