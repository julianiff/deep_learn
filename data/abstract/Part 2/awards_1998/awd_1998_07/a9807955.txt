Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers   University to
              purchase a  300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)   spectrometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   such as the following:
              (1) the synthesis of transition-metal promoted   functionalization of
              hydrocarbons, (2) the synthesis of natural products,   (3) the synthesis of
              organic species of biological interest for   mechanistic studies, (4) the
              chemistry of reactive intermediates such as   carbenes, (5) the destruction of
              toxic phosphonates,  (6) the structure   and stability of surfactant aggregates
              at a molecular level, and (7)   radical cation reactivity.  Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy   is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of   the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances,   characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to   study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access   to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are   carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies are   useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology
