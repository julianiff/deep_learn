Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at The University   of Utah to
              acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector.  This   equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1) structural
              studies of organic-based magnets; (2)   supramolecular chemistry and
              self-assembly; (3) metal pentadienyl   chemistry; (4) organometallic chemistry;
              and (5) mechanistic studies on   dinuclear hydrolytic catalysts.   The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full
              three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the
              precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule
              and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
