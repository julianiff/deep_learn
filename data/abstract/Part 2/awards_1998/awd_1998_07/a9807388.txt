Abstract    :
              MOCK, C.J. and BIRKELAND, K.W.  The study examines the snow avalanche
              climatology of the intermontane west.  The basic objectives are to:
              (1)-evaluate-the-spatio-temporal-variability-of-snow and avalanche climates;
              (2) reconstruct longer-term avalanche records using contemporary relationships
              between climate and avalanche data; (3) analyze the synoptic scale climatology
              that may affect the timing, recurrence, and spatial variability of avalanche
              responses; and, (4) explore possible responses of snow avalanche climates under
              climatic change scenarios.  Data on climatic, snowpack, avalanche, and
              atmospheric processes will be compiled from existing large archives such as the
              Westwide Avalanche Network and SNOTEL and from snow survey records and
              long-term climate records.  The results will be important to (a) avalanche
              forecasting, (b) understanding the physical processes of avalanche activity,
              (c) improved hazard regulation and delineation, and (d) scientific
              understanding of mountain environments.
