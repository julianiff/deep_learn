Abstract    :
              The research proposed involves the development of methods for the   synthesis of
              small molecule libraries based on solid supports.   In   earlier NSF supported
              work, an N-acylsulfonamide linker was developed   which allowed
              chemoselectively activated nucleophilic release of library   members in a final
              step.   This development will now be extended to   libraries incorporating
              amino acids and peptides.   Stereochemicaly   defined compounds will be
              generated both by linking optically active   building blocks and by
              synthesizing asymmetric centers on the solid   supports.  With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is continuing support
              for the research of Dr. Jonathan   A. Ellman in the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of California   at Berkeley.   The research focuses on
              developing improved combinatorial   methods for the synthesis of libraries of
              small molecules which can be   useful in the fields of drug discovery,
              molecular recognition, materials   development, and catalysis.   Graduate
              students will receive valuable   training in organic synthesis and
              combinatorial chemistry, which will   prepare them for careers in several
              rapidly growing industries.
