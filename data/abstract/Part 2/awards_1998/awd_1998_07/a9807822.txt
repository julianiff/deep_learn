Abstract    :
              9807822  BARISAS    The long-term goal of this project is to understand in
              biophysical terms the mechanism of function of the mast cell
              function-associated antigen(MAFA) on rat 2H3-RBL cells.  MAFA is a type II
              membrane protein with a C-type lectin extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic
              YSTL motif.  Crosslinking of this protein inhibits signaling by the type I Fce
              receptor (FceR1) despite the presence of only one MAFA per twenty FceR1.  The
              interactions of MAFA with FceR1 and other membrane proteins will be examined
              through optical approaches including time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy,
              fluorescence photobleaching recovery and fluorescence energy transfer. 
              Differences in these interactions among cells receiving various stimulatory and
              inhibitory stimuli, such as clustering FceR1 by antigen or clustering MAFA by
              the MAFA-specific antibody G63 will be examined.  Finally, this overall
              experimental approach will be extended to chimeric molecules derived from MAFA
              and expressed in cells capable of FceR1 signaling.    This project provides an
              excellent opportunity to examine how cell surface molecules of one kind can
              regulate the function of another molecule present in much larger numbers.  The
              use of molecular biological methods to produce selectively-modified receptors
              and signaling molecules in combination with biophysical approaches to measuring
              quantitative parameters of these molecules on living cells provides a powerful
              approach by which to address this problem.  It also provides an opportunity to
              refine, for use by the larger biophysical community, laser optical techniques
              for examining the behavior of cell membrane proteins.  These methods are a
              strength of this laboratory.
