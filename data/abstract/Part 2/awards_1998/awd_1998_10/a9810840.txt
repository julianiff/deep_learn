Abstract    :
                Because of their numerous applications, e.g., sales of U.S. Treasury bills and
              spectrum licenses, multi unit auctions have attracted the interest of
              practitioners and economists. There is a need to identify practical, multi unit
              mechanisms that implement efficient outcomes and generate high seller's
              revenues in various environments.  Recently, Ausubel (1997) defined a dynamic,
              open, ascending price auction and demonstrated that it has several advantages
              over many commonly used multi unit mechanisms: it produces efficient
              allocations and generates higher revenues. In addition, the new ascending price
              auction is simple and sufficiently appealing to be of practical use.  The
              ascending price auction and the well known Vickrey auction are compared
              experimentally to test whether the predicted advantages of the new multi unit
              mechanism are realized in practiced. The relative performance of both auctions
              is evaluated in terms of efficiency and revenue. Experimental regularities in
              the performance of the mentioned mechanisms can contribute to the development
              and implementation of more adequate trading institutions.
