Abstract    :
              9810540  Mileham   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              project will develop a bioreceptive film to endotoxin and demonstrate its
              response by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy
              (SEM).  Airborne endotoxin has been identified as a major health hazard in many
              agricultural  and industrial settings.  Exposure to airborne endotoxin is
              related to organic dust toxic syndrome, chronic bronchitis, hypersensitivity
              pneumonitis, mucousal membrane irritation, and reduced lung capacity.  An
              endotoxin sensor that incorporates a highly selective bioreceptive film with a
              highly sensitive microsensor could provide the high selectivity and sensitivity
              needed for  in-situ detection.  This will require the selective capture of
              airborne endotoxin by use of a specific non-covalent reaction, such as ionic or
              hydrophobic binding. The Phase II work will measure airborne endotoxin with  an
              acoustic microsensor, or other sensor platform, in a prototype system.  The
              proposed technique is a significant technological innovation, since a method
              for rapid, on-site detection of airborne endotoxin has not been developed.     
                  A biosensor to detect airborne endotoxin will have commercial applications
              to protect human health in many areas including livestock confinement and
              processing facilities (swine, poultry, dairy), produce storage and processing
              facilities, cotton processing facilities, waste management  facilities, and air
              quality monitoring of office buildings.  Since endotoxin also represents a
              threat to the health of livestock, particularly swine and poultry, the
              animal/veterinary sciences market is also expected to be significant.
