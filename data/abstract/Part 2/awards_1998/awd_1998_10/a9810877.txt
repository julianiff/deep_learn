Abstract    :
              The College of Micronesia - FSM is composed of branch campuses located on four
              different islands.  Internet connection will permit networked facilitation of
              education utilizing both local education initiatives and the world-wide
              utilization of the Internet.  The clear goal is to prepare its students for the
              21st century through Internet coursework development, extension of information
              collection by its National Campus Learning Resource Center, and job preparation
              by acquiring skills in information search, retrieval and contribution.  The
              award provides partial support of the project for two years.
