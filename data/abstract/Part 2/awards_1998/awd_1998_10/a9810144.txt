Abstract    :
              The study assesses the viability of forest uses in Kabarole District, western
              Uganda, in terms of particular measures of resiliency and sustainability.  Four
              different communities have access to forest resources (domestic users, brewery
              and still operators, brick and charcoal producers, and tea companies), and the
              members of each of these communities vary in their capacity to extract and
              benefit from the forest resources.  In addition, four different property
              regimes characterize the forest property systems in Western Uganda:  (1) state
              forests, (2) royal and church forests, (3) corporate forests, and (4) village
              forests.  The study will examine the way in which these property systems
              disparately affect the measures of resiliency and sustainability employed in
              the study.   The energy efficiency of the cooking and industrial burning
              technology employed by these user groups will be analyzed and compared to
              determine if ownership of the forest resource and/or the technology explains
              patterns of efficiency.  The project uses a regional political ecology
              framework to integrate the notions of forest access and control by these
              diverse (and often conflicting) actors with empirical assessments of actual
              forest conditions.  At the core of the research is the recognition that forest
              conservation and management in developing countries must incorporate local
              resource demands and foster local participation in forest management.
