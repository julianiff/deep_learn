The New York Academy of Science conference entitled
              "Molecular Strategies in Biological Evolution" has the objective of providing a
              forum in which to explore the concept that DNA encodes information that
              modulates its own rate of evolution.  As genomic dabatases explode, it is
              becoming possible to query nucleic acid sequences at a broader, more integrated
              level than has been possible previously in regard to the organization and
              evolution of genes.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an
              interdisciplinary forum that will encourage the necessary collaborations
              between biologists and mathematicians who are interested in genome-encoded
              strategies that facilitate adaptation to the environment at the DNA level.
