Abstract    :
              ECS-9810242  Freudenberg    Advanced technology powertrains are being proposed
              to satisfy demands for lower emissions and higher fuel economy without
              sacrificing drivability.  The novel actuators added to meet these goals
              typically interact with more than one powertrain subsystem.  Current control
              calibration strategies are based upon multiple single control loops, and cannot
              compensate for these interactions.  Instead, sophisticated multivariable
              control will be needed to achieve the performance potential of advanced
              engines.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop and apply system
              theoretic concepts to the problem of controller design for highly interacting
              advanced powertrains.  In particular, we address the problem of selecting a
              multivariable controller architecture that best meets the tradeoff  between
              system performance and control complexity.  The Principal Investigator will
              work with engineers at Ford who have access to models of advanced powertrains 
              and dynamometer test facilities with which to evaluate proposed control
              algorithms.  Automotive powertrains are a challenging application field in
              which methods of systems and control are needed to solve important
              technological problems.
