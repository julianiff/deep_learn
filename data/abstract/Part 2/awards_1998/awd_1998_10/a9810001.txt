Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a continuing program of ground-based millimeter wave
              spectroscopic measurements of trace gases in the earth's mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere (MLT), using existing astronomical receivers at Kitt Peak National
              Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).  The millimeter observations of mesospheric
              water isotope ratios provide unique diagnostics to investigate the signatures
              vertical transport of hydrogen-bearing species from above and below the
              mesosphere may force in the vertical profiles, as well as D/H ratios, of
              mesospheric water.  The millimeter observations support SNOE and TIMED
              spacecraft observations.
