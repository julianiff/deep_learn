Abstract    :
              9810022  A series of two planning workshops are supported with the goals  of
              establishing the state of the art in the three scientific  communities of
              Computer Security, Fault Tolerance, and Software  Assurance and to set the
              course for future research. The  meetings, July 7-9, 1998 in York, UK and
              November 11-13, 1998 in  the USA, focus on the practical needs of system
              development,  where security, fault tolerance, and assurance requirements are 
              increasing dramatically with the rapid spread of commercial  enterprises into
              cyberspace. The workshops are designed to  promote a true dialogue between the
              communities, as well as  foster collaborations between researchers in the USA
              and abroad.  The motivating idea for the workshops is that these three 
              communities face many closely related problems, and consequently  solutions
              from one community are likely to be relevant in all  communities. Participants
              are asked to elaborate the fundamental  challenges facing their community, map
              these challenges to  related problems in the companion communities, and
              identify  promising solution paths. A book is planned to capture the  results
              of the workshop, including papers and supplementary  reports from the meetings.
