This U.S.-Russia Cooperative Research award is to
              support the "International Seismic-Volcanic Workshop on Kamchatkan-Aleutian
              Subduction Processes" to be held in July 1998 in Kamchatka.  The U.S.
              co-organizers are Dr. John C. Eichelberger and Dr. Jonathan Dehn of the
              University of Alaska Fairbanks.  The Russian co-organizer is Dr. Boris Ivanov,
              Director of the Institute of Volcanic Geology and Geochemistry of the Far
              Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The tectonic plate
              boundary represented by the Aleutian/Alaska and Kamchatka/Kuril Volcanic Arcs,
              a major planetary structure crossed by international frontiers, is among the
              most active sites of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions on Earth.  Three
              factors have led to the scientific neglect of this region: (1) small population
              and value of assets at risk; (2) politically mandated restrictions on travel;
              and (3) the challenging conditions of distance and weather.  The first
              situation has been reversed by the rapid growth of international air traffic
              between Asia and North America and its vulnerability to volcanic ash, and the
              second by the end of the Cold War.  Accordingly, it is time for scientists to
              join together and conquer the third factor.  Approximately 50 researchers from
              Russia, the U.S., and Japan will meet to exchange ideas and visit field areas
              of scientific merit which previously have been inaccessible.  Considerable
              emphasis is being placed on the involvement of graduate students in the
              conference in order to foster future long-term relationships.

This research
              in seismology and volcanology fulfills the program objectives of bringing
              together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
