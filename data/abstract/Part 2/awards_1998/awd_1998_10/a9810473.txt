Abstract    :
                This research is a cross-national study of distributive justice norms
              concerning income distribution.  Three laboratory experiments are used to
              determine what principles individuals choose when judging the fairness of
              income distributions.  The experimental design draws on both normative and
              empirical research on distributive justice.  It is hypothesized that
              individuals make allocation judgments by relying on four major allocation
              principles -- equality, need, merit, and efficiency.  Allocation norms are
              analyzed across a diverse population within the United States and
              cross-nationally by replicating the experiments in Norway.  This research is
              not only be of interest to scholars in fields concerned with distributive
              justice, including political science, sociology, economics, philosophy, but
              also to those interested in broader social and political issues such as
              institutional legitimacy, the development of the welfare state, social policy,
              and social and political behavior.
