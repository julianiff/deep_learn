Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection from the University of Kansas to 
              the vBNS via the Great Plains Network, a high performance regional network 
              dedicated to supporting the research needs of the universities in a six state 
              Great Plains region. This Very High Performance Backbone Network Service 
              (vBNS)  connection will support meritorious research projects having specific
              network  requirements that cannot easily be met through the commodity Internet.
               Examples  of research areas include Cosmology, Biodiversity and Environmental 
              Informatics, Earth Systems Science, and Chemical Engineering Applications 
              Technology.
