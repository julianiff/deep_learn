Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102 (replaces NSF  96-64).
              It  provides for partial support for a DS3 connection to the very high
              performance  Backbone Network Service (vBNS) for Wake Forest University for two
              years. This  connection will facilitate research involving applications in
              high-performance  computing, high-speed communications, or computer
              visualization problems,  often  in medical imaging and virtual medicine.
              Practical applications include but  are  not limited to Virtual Endoscopy, a
              worldwide medical image archive available  to the public, and an experimental
              critical-care neonatal tele-echocardiology  service.
