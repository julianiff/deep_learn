The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is
located at
              the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and is
directed by Dr. Willard
              Miller, Jr.  The mission of the IMA is to
identify problems and areas of
              mathematical sciences research
related to challenges faced by other sciences
              and industry, to
demonstrate the impact of mathematics and statistics on
              other
disciplines, and to encourage the engagement of mathematical
scientists
              with these areas of application.  Participants in IMA
activities include long-
              and short-term visitors, drawn from the
mathematical sciences and other
              disciplines relevant to current
programs.  This award includes support for
              postdoctoral fellows,
whose mentoring is an essential element of the IMA's
              work.  Some
of the Institute's postdoctoral researchers spend much of
              their
time working with participating corporations of the IMA, and
industrial
              researchers are involved in IMA programs and program
planning.

The IMA
              hosts scientific programs on short (weekend to one-week)
and long (academic
              year) time scales.  Most of the Institute's
programs are conducted in its
              Minneapolis facilities, but the IMA
also sponsors conferences and graduate
              student summer programs at
its academic participating institutions.  This
              institute has no
permanent faculty or research personnel, draws program
              organizers
from many disciplines, and anchors the participant lists
              for
annual programs in a base of distinguished visitors and one- or
two-year
              postdoctoral researchers.  The Institute for Mathematics
and its Applications
              is supported by the NSF as a Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute, funded
              by the Division of
Mathematical Sciences.
