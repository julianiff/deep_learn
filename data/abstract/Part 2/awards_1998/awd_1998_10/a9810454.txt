Abstract    :
                   This project is a two-year initiative of the Women's and  Gender Studies
              Program and the Women in Science and Engineering  Project at North Carolina
              State University.  A sequence of seminars  for science, engineering, and
              mathematics (SEC) faculty and  teachers who want to revise their SEM course
              syllabi to include the  new scholarship on women and people of color, followed
              by an  evaluation of the extent of those revisions and their impact on 
              students' attitudes and behavior.  Goals are to foster ties between  SEM and
              women's studies curriculum initiatives; to evaluate if/how  the new scholarship
              can encourage an inclusionary culture in SEM  courses; and to develop a
              prototypical and national model  evaluation process.  A third of the
              participants already teach  women's studies courses that have science content. 
              Women's studies  scholarship is defined as a "social innovation" that has a 
              "diffusion" process.  Using sequential surveys, interviews, and  observational
              data, an evaluation will be done on how faculty adopt  and implement the
              scholarship in their courses, how the students  respond to it, and the degree
              to which students' attitudes and  behaviors change as a result.  This approach
              contributes a much  needed empirical component to SEM-women's studies
              collaborations.
