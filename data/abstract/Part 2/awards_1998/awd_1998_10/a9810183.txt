Abstract    :
              9810183  Shalaev    This proposal is concerned with nonlinear near field optical
               processes in fractal thin films, namely self-affine surfaces  and 2d random
              metal-dielectric films. Nonlinear optical  processes to be investigated
              include: Kerr-type nonlinear  refraction and absorption, nearly-degenerate four
              wave  mixing, and second and higher harmonic generation.  Collective optical
              excitations of fractal thin films lead to  "hot" spots which are separated in
              space by distances much  larger than the spot size. These spatially localized
              "hot  spots" represent the eigenmodes of a fractal film. Spatial  distributions
              of the local (near-field) nonlinear spectra on  a fractal thin film will be
              calculated. These spectra are  experimentally accessible by parking a tip of a
              photon  scanning tunneling microscope at different points on the  surface and
              varying the wavelength. Important information  are obtained about the local
              configurations of a fractal  film and the resonance frequencies of these
              nm-scale random  areas of the film. Phase and amplitude correlation  properties
              of the nonlinear fields generated from different  spots of a fractal film will
              be studied by analyzing the  statistics of the nonlinear near-zone fields,
              e.g., through  two-point correlation functions. %%% The PI's theoretical 
              research contributes to the development of a nonlinear  optical spectroscopy of
              single molecules and materials of  dimensions on the scale of molecules.  ***
