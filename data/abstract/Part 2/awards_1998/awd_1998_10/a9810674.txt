Abstract    :
              9810674  Rundel  Desert annuals have been an important group for study by many
              ecologists, including population biologists modeling strategies of life history
              adaptations. Such models have generally assumed a bet-hedging strategy in
              desert annuals in which not all seeds germinate when good growing conditions
              occur following fall and winter rains. There are limited data suggesting that
              desert annuals have dormancy mechanisms that allow a conservative strategy in
              which subsets of seed pools germinate over a series of years. The close
              phylogenetic relationship between a number of desert annuals and post-fire
              chaparral annuals, which have a predictive germination strategy cured by
              chemical signals, suggests that predictive germination strategies may also be
              present among desert annuals. This project will be investigating the effect of
              environmental chemical cues for germination in a number of desert annuals from
              the winter-rainfall Mojave and Colorado Deserts in California. El Ni o
              conditions in 1997-1998 are providing unusual conditions which have produced
              abundant germination and seed set of both common and rare desert annuals.
