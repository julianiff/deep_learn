Abstract    :
              Over the next four years approximately 120 bridges will be destroyed and rebuilt
              as part of the 1-15 reconstruction through Salt Lake City, Utah.  This is a
              rare opportunity to destructively test older bridge structures constructed in
              the 1960's.  The researchers have been given access to a nine span bridge, the
              South Temple overpass bridge.  This bridge will be accessible for testing on
              about March 1st, for a period of about six weeks.  The availability of this
              bridge provides the initial opportunity to investigate the potential of using
              forced vibration analysis and dynamic characterization as a non-destructive
              evaluation technique.  After the bridge has been damaged the dynamic
              characteristics will be redetermined.  The damage in the structure should be
              manifest in the change of the natural frequencies and mode shapes from the
              undamaged to the damaged state of the bridge.  This evaluation approach would
              be especially applicable to structures where damage might not be readily
              visible at the joint between a column and pile cap, or concrete structures
              where plastic hinges that form might not be immediately obvious or hidden by
              architectural coverings.  This project is a test of an application of proven
              theories of structural dynamics.
