This award is made under the high performance connections
              portion of ANIR's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. Under
              the auspices of the South Carolina Research Authority (SCRA), it provides
              partial support for two years for DS-3 connections from three South Carolina
              institutions: Clemson University, the Medical University of South Carolina and
              the University of South Carolina to Columbia, SC and OC3 from that point to the
              vBNS. This award will assist the SCRA with Phase I of a planned set of major
              enhancements to their SC Information Network (SCINET). Meritorious research to
              be supported through access to the vBNS includes work in Computer Science,
              Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematical Sciences, Physics, Bio- and
              Chemical Engineering, Digital Libraries, and in several areas of Medicine.
