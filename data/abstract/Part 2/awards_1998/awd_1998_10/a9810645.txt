Abstract    :
              This award is a continuation of work involving theoretical calculations of cross
              sections and other quantities for atomic collision processes important in the
              upper atmosphere.  Over the past three and a half years, the methodology to
              perform quantum mechanical coupled channel calculations for collisions has been
              developed.  These techniques will be used in the investigation of the charge
              exchange process between hydrogen and oxygen as these gases are so abundant in
              planetary atmospheres.  Such studies will also be crucial in current modeling
              efforts of the terrestrial hydrogen exosphere.
