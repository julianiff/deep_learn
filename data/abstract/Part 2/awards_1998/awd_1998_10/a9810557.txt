Abstract    :
              9810557  Bettermann   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project
              aims to: (1) design, build and program a simple, dedicated instrument for
              Submitochondrial particle (SMP) performing tests, (2) develop software and
              protocols capable of flexibly addressing real world monitoring situations, (3)
              provide a limited number of demonstration units to potential customers for beta
              testing purposes, and (4) build toward a fully autonomous instrument (Phase
              II).  SMP tests consist of a suite of robust biochemical toxicity bioassays
              that are simple and inexpensive to perform; require only basic laboratory
              equipment to conduct; and yield near-real time data (minutes).  Bioenergetic
              processes critical to cell viability are measured by tracking the redox status
              of nicotinamide coenzymes by spectrophotometry, although other detection
              schemes (O2 dye coupling, fluorescence, use of lasers, etc.) are feasible.  The
              technology has been proven to perform well in a variety of environmental and
              industrial situations as a surrogate for conventional whole-organism toxicity
              tests.          Potential commercial applications are manifold and diverse, but
              acceptance has been slow for lack of a cheap (<$300), dedicated, yet flexible
              instrument that would minimize user training and could be incorporated into
              automated processes. Microcontroller devices are simple, inexpensive,
              programmable computing devices with data input/output capabilities linkable to
              detectors, controllers, and other devices.
