Abstract    :
              9810098  Simon  The objective of this research is to extend porohyperelastic 
              transport swelling (PHETS) field theories developed by the  investigators for
              the coupled structural and transport  properties of large arteries.  New finite
              element models  based on the extended theories will be implemented and used  to
              analyze the results of experiments on the transport of  charged and neutral
              species in excised rabbit carotid  arteries under various loading conditions. 
              With PHETS  material parameters for nonlinear anisotropic tissue  elasticity,
              permeability, diffusivity, mechano-chemical  coupling, and convection thus
              identified from the analysis  of the experimental studies, the new models will
              be able to  predict the results of in-vivo conditions that can not  readily be
              performed experimentally and to characterize the  action of intravascular local
              drug delivery systems.  Experimental studies in de-endothelialized rabbit
              carotid  arteries will examine the transport of fluorescence-labeled  charged
              and neutral species under pressure loading alone as  well as combined pressure
              and flow conditions.  ***
