Abstract    :
              	The overall goal of this research is to understand the processes responsible of
              extratropical cyclogenesis.  The specific objectives of this project are to
              characterize the basic state flow within which upper tropospheric short waves
              evolve, to identify the disturbances antecedent to upper and lower tropospheric
              cyclogenesis and their relationship to the so-called singular vectors of the
              observed flow, and to understand the role of latent heat release associated
              with deep moist convection in the development of midlatitude upper tropospheric
              waves.  The research will utilize data from the North American radiosonde and
              rawinsonde network, analysis and forecast fields from the National Centers for
              Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational weather forecast models, and data
              from FASTEX (Fronts and Atlantic Storm Track Experiment) and from NORPEX (North
              Pacific Experiment).  The NCAR limited area non-hydrostatic mesoscale model
              (MM5) will be employed to help elucidate the interactions between the basic
              state and the short wave precursors.

	The results from this research should
              have practical application in improving short and medium range weather
              forecasts.  In addition, they may provide some guidance in the deployment of
              adaptive observing systems for weather prediction.
