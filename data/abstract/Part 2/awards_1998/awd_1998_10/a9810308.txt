Abstract    :
              Math Experiences for Girls Achievement Camp (MEGA Camp)is a  summer enrichment
              program in mathematics and science for 6th  grade girls, aimed at attracting
              minorities.  The home site of  this project is California State University at
              Hayward (CSUH).   Objectives are to improve recruitment and retention of girls
              in  science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) education and careers  by
              increasing awareness of career options, demonstrating that  mathematics can be
              fun and challenging without being  intimidating, strengthening basic skills,
              and improving work-  ethic, attitudes, self-image, and written and verbal 
              communication skills.  Daily activities will alternate between  field trips to
              local companies or organizations and specifically  designed follow-up lessons. 
              Field trip sites will be the NASA  Ames Research Center, The Technology Museum
              of Innovation, The  Microscope and Graphic Imaging Center (MAGIC), and Dreyer's
               Grand Ice Cream Plant.  Each field trip cycle will have four  components: an
              introduction, a site visit, a follow-up activity,  and an update of the MEGA
              Camp website.
