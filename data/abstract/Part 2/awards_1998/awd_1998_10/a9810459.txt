Abstract    :
                   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to
              develop a simple, compact, easy-to-use microbial detection system consisting of
              application specific sample preparation kits, selective enrichment broths, and
              fiber optic biosensor instrumentation for real time detection and
              identification of the targeted pathogens in food.  With this integrated
              microbial detection system, the initial biosensor result (5 to 10 min) would
              identify the presence of the pathogen.  Subsequent selective culture (0.5 to 3
              hrs) and a post-culture assay measurement would determine pathogen viability. 
              Foods such as beef, poultry, and seafood harbor a wide variety of
              microorganisms derived from the animal itself, the environment, and
              equipment/human contact during processing.  Some of these microbes are
              pathogens and can be potentially deadly to humans.  These microbial pathogens
              include E. coli 0157:H7 in beef, Salmonella in poultry, and Vibrio vulnificus
              in shellfish.  Recent food-borne outbreaks by these and other microbes
              underscore the importance of food safety and the critical need for rapid and
              accurate tests to identify food-borne pathogens.       The system can be
              utilized for pathogen detection in the food, food processing, water quality,
              and pharmaceutical quality control industries.  It may also be used for the
              detection of terrorist-released biowarfare weapons in public facilities such as
              subways and arenas.
