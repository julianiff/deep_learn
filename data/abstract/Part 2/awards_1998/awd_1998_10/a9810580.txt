Abstract    :
              Abstract    Brass, Garrett W.  9810580    This action continues the Interagency
              Agreement between the NSF and the Arctic Research Commission and provides for
              its continuing operations.  The Arctic Research Commission was established
              under the Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-373) and Executive
              Order 12501.  The General Services Administration will provide administrative
              services to the Commission as specified in PL#98-373  Section 106(4) .  This
              action fulfills the intent of Congress to provide FY 1998 funding for the
              Commission through the NSF.
