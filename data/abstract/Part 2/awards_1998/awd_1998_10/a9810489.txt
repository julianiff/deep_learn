This planning grant project originates from the Juneau School
              District in Juneau, Alaska, and involves the Juneau and Sitka School Districts,
              the Alyeska Central School (the statewide correspondence study program), and
              the University of Alaska Southeast.  The initiative focuses on the planning
              needed for an LSC effort in mathematics at the K-8 levels.  The proposal
              indicates that all of Southeast Alaska is characterized by a diverse student
              population, with particular concern for Alaskan Native children who have not
              experienced the success which their parents and community would wish for them. 
              This planning grant proposal seeks to involve the teacher participants in
              planning for the consideration and implementation of standards-based
              mathematics instruction.  Major objectives of the project will include the
              development of a plan to use local/regional resources to raise the level of
              content and pedagogical knowledge of K-8 teachers, assess the impact of
              emerging technology on daily mathematics instruction, analyze the role of
              assessment and consider how to use such results to adjust instruction.
