Abstract    :
              9810466  B.Kutter    This action is to support a workshop in Davis, CA, during
              1998, to  discuss  the needs in geotechnical engineering and engineering
              seismology  within the  proposed National Network for High Performance Seismic
              Simulation  (NHPS).  While the focus is on the needs within geotechnical
              engineering,  the  interface with facilities for structural and coastal
              engineering  seismic  simulation will be considered.  The proposed NHPS
              responds to the need, expressed via a series of  workshops extending over a
              period of twenty years, to obtain  experimental  data on the behavior of
              engineering materials, soils, and  constructed  facilities during earthquake
              strong-ground shaking.  Integral to  the NHPS  is the concept of connecting the
              experimental facilities via a  modern  high-performance computer and
              communication network in order to  enhance the  capabilities of the individual
              facilities through synergism, and  to provide  remote access by off-site users.
               It is planned to extend the  network to  include key experimental facilities
              around the world.  The objective of this workshop is to discuss challenging
              research  topics  to be addressed, and the specific experimental facilities
              needed  to perform  the associated experiments.  It is expected that the
              deliberations of this workshop will: (1)  contribute to a clearer definition of
              the experimental facilities  to be  included within the NHPS, and the
              experiments that can be  undertaken using  these facilities; and (2) begin a
              discussion of important culture  changes  associated with the NHPS resulting
              from remote access  capabilities, the  rapid dissemination of results, and the
              need to give appropriate  authorship  credit for the rapid publication of
              experimental results.  ***
