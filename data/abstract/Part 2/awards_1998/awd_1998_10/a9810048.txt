Abstract    :
              ECS-9810048  Bodson    The project will provide funds for students to travel to
              the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, which will be held on
              December 16-18, 1998 in Tampa, Florida.  The goal is to attract engineering
              students to the field of control systems, and to give the opportunity to
              students who have chosen control systems as a specialty to be informed about 
              the most recent developments in control systems theory and practice.
