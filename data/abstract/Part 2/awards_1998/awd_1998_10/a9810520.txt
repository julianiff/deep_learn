The proposed work will determine if methyl salicylic
              acid (MeSA) serves a role in establishing plant defense responses when it is in
              volatile and non-volatile forms.  Prior work has established that salicylic
              acid functions as an important signal for induction of plant defense responses.
               Recent preliminary data indicates that injured or infected plants produce
              sufficient MeSA to signal neighboring plants to induce their defense responses,
              presumably as a precautionary means against potential attack.  In addition,
              other preliminary data indicate that mesa may serve as a phloem mobile from of
              SA.  The results of the proposed experiments will demonstrate the roles of MeSA
              in the defense signally process.  Moreover, as part of the work, the PI will
              complete the characterization of the biochemical steps and enzymes involved in
              MeSA production.  The results of this basic research may lead to improved
              methods for increasing the natural defense mechanisms in plants and, thus, may
              have agronomic significance.
