Abstract    :
              9810716  Thunell    This ESH award will support the collection and initial 
              analysis of long piston cores from the Indonesian region.  Sites of very high
              accumulation rates will be cored, in  order to provide sample intervals at
              decaded to century  scale through the last 60,000 years.  The stable isotopic 
              composition of planktic and benthic foraminifera will be  measured in
              conjunction with alkenone chemistry of marine  organic matter to reconstruct
              sea surface temperatures.  These data will be used to assess the stability of
              tropical  sea surface temperatures under varying global climates.  Research
              will be conducted as part of the IGPB-PAGES IMAGES  program.
