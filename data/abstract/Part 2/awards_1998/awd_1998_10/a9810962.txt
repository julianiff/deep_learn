              ABSTRACT

OCE-9810962


One of the ways scientists try to understand the
              the history of biological production in the ocean and its relationship to
              climatic history through the carbon cycle is through examination of the
              sedimentary record of marine carbonates.  Interpretation of changes in
              glacial/interglacial carbonate accumulation rates requires that we understand
              the mechanism(s) of calcite dissolution, and until now investigators have tried
              to approach this problem indirectly by estimating the amount of CaCO3 remaining
              after dissolution.  The two candidate mechanisms most widely considered are
              chemical erosion, in which the carbonate sediment uniformly dissolves, and
              non-homogeneous dissolution, in which the dissolution is not uniform. In this
              project, the PIs will develop and use a direct method for determining the
              dissolution mechanism by determining radiocarbon ages of inorganic carbon in
              sediment porewaters generated by CaCO3 dissolution and by the oxidation of
              organic matter.  A full suite of carbon and carbon isotopic measurements will
              be made on solids and porewaters in sediments from the Eastern Equatorial
              Atlantic and the Western Equatorial Pacific to give a fresh evaluation of the
              mechanism of dissolution.
