Abstract    :
              Poly-(ethylene glycol) chains are frequently grafted to biomaterials to make
              them more biocompatible for medical applications.  The improved
              biocompatibility is thought to result from reduced interactions with the
              surface proteins of cells, tissues, etc.  However, without explanation,
              increased interactions are sometimes observed.  The primary aim of this
              proposal is to determine the chemical/physical basis of the protein
              interactions with these hydrophilic polymer chains.  The hypothesis is that the
              polymer chain solvation and configuration states are key determinants of the
              biological activity of the polyglycol coatings.  Variables such as polymer
              thickness, molecular weight, grafting density, and solvent interactions will be
              coorelated with the extent of protein interactioins as determined by direct
              surface force measurements.  Attempts will be made to explain deviations from
              commonly accepted rules and, in particular, where surfaces undergo transitions
              from biocompatible to non-compatible forces.
