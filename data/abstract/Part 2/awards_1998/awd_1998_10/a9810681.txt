Abstract    :
                    9810681  Bourque  This study builds on the extant literature by examining
              how  predictions of floods from the El Nino Southern Oscillations  affect Los
              Angeles County residents.  The study has four  objectives.  The first objective
              of the study is to replicate  cross-sectional data analyses across two
              different types of  disasters in order to test whether relationships observed
              in  previous earthquake studies can be applied to the El Nino event.   The
              second objective is to provide researchers with longitudinal  data about a
              sample of residents of Los Angeles County across two  different disasters in
              order to identify whether previously  observed associations can be expanded
              into casual relationships.   The third objective is to identify the effects of
              the El Nino  event on the Los Angeles community, including its physical, 
              emotional and economic impacts.  Finally, the fourth objective is  to provide
              information about the role of media and public  officials in preparedness
              activities.  A survey of Los Angeles  County residents will be conducted
              employing computer assisted  telephone interviewing.  ***
