Abstract    :
              Dr. Daniel Falvey at the University of Maryland - College Park is supported   by
              the NSF Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.   The research   involves
              spectroscopic and reactivity studies of nitrenium ions (NR2+),   which are
              nitrogen analogues of carbonium ions.   They contain a pair of   nonbonding
              electrons which may align to give singlet or triplet spin   states, each with
              its own distinct reactivity pattern, and may be   intermediates in chemical
              carcinogenesis.   Reactions with nucleophilic   guanine bases in DNA are
              believed to result in mutagenic lesions which   can lead to cancer.  The
              research focuses on the structure and reactivity of nitrenium ions -   reactive
              intermediates which may be involved in causing some kinds of   cancer.   The
              work will be of interest to others working in related   fields, and will
              provide valuable training to graduate students   interested in careers in
              organic chemistry or oncology.
