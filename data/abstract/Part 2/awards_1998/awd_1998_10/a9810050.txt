Abstract    :
              Aron Kuppermann is supported by the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry
              Program to use massively parallel computers to investigate   resonances and
              electronically non-adiabatic effects in state-to-state   triatomic reaction
              dynamics, and to generate benchmark state-to-state   tetratomic reaction cross
              sections.  Accurate three-dimensional quantum   mechanical reactive scattering
              calculations will be performed to study   the geometric phase effect and other
              electronic nonadiabatic coupling   effects on tri- and tetratomic scattering
              processes.  New algorithms and   computing methodologies will be designed and
              implemented.  Elementary bimolecular chemical reactions are the basic steps of
              complex   technologically important systems, such as combustion processes,  
              atmospheric chemistry, chemical lasers, and plasma reactors.  Many   reactive
              species are short-lived and not experimentally isolable, and   thus studying
              their reaction rates theoretically is often the only   approach to elucidate
              the molecular-level details.  In this project,   high-performance computing
              resources are essential to advancing our   understanding of important gas-phase
              chemical reactions.
