Abstract    :
              Silicon Valley is Santa Clara Valley, California, a site of many advances and
              accomplishments in the new industry of computer science and information
              technology.  This project studies how cultural models of work are applied to a
              variety of other domains, particularly home life, by examining the actions and
              values embedded in work processes, rationales, relationships and stories. 
              These `schemata` are placed into novel contexts such as home, education,
              commerce as well as transferred between diverse work organizations.  The
              researchers will study how this process occurs among people positioned
              differently throughout the Silicon Valley region.  The differences stem from a
              variety of factors such as ethnicity, class, work or profession, gender and
              age.  The study will investigate how technologies and economic structures and
              social organizations interact in peoples' daily lives.  Through the analysis of
              a set of 450 interviews with 150 informants, the researchers will advance our
              understanding of how involvement with the new information technology industry
              is affecting the non-work lives of workers, and vice versa.  This new knowledge
              will help planners as well as society at large understand the ongoing impact of
              computers in society.
