Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be the attempt to discover the herbivorous prey
              responsible for the production of an acyclic tetrapeptide in the carivorous
              mollusk, P. speciosa.  Further, the sponge of the order Verongida will be the
              target in the search for the origin of the isocyano function in marine sponges.
               Finally, collections will be made to find leads for bioactive marine natural
              products.  

With this Accomplishment Based Renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Paul J.
              Scheuer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hawaii, Manoa. 
              Professor Scheuer will focus his work on gaining an understanding of the
              molecular basis of marine ecology on coral reefs, on discovering the
              biosynthetic pathway by which sponges produce isocyanoterpenes and on
              collecting leads for compounds that have important biological properties.
