Abstract    :
              9810065  Whitehead    The project is for conducting laboratory experiments in a 
              cylinder of rotating stratified water to model ocean  circulation.  Three
              experiments will be conducted:  (1)  forcing by side-wall heating;  (2) forcing
              by a rotating lid  that has radial temperature gradient;  (3) the cylinder 
              bottom is conical which may be conductive or insulating.  Experimental results
              will be compared with linear theories,  but also extended to cases of higher
              Rossby number.
