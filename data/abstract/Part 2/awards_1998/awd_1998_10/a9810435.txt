Abstract    :
              Parental Age and Allocation of Resources to Offspring: A Collaborative
              project

This is a collaborative project between Lala Carr Steelman
              (University of South Carolina) and Brian Powell (Indiana University). The major
              objective of this research is to explore the connection between parental age
              and the flow of resources to children and, in turn, the educational
              consequences children experience in this process. Data are from the National
              Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, High School and Beyond, and the
              National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. Little prior
              research has examined the relationship between parental age and parental
              investments in children. Our analysis focuses on five questions: (1) What is
              the form of the relationship between parental age and the allocation of
              resources to children? (2) How does the inclusion of socio-demographic and
              familial factors alter the relationship between parental age and the allocation
              of resources to children? (3) Does the relationship between parental age and
              allocation of resources to children vary by the sex of the parent? (4) Does the
              relationship between parental age and allocation of resources to children vary
              across different family structures and racial groups? (5) Is parental age
              related to educational and other status outcomes for children and, if so, is
              the relationship via the allocation of resources? Understanding whether
              resource allocation is influenced by parental age and distinguishing those
              resources which are most affected may prove useful in identifying resources
              that may be fruitfully augmented by other sources in the public and private
              sectors--such as schools, the community, and the government.
