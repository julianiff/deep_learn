Abstract    :
              9810417  Kerrick    Following a period of marked earthquake activity in 1989, 
              emission of CO2 from the flanks of Mammoth Mountain, California,  resulted in
              large areas of tree kill.  This region again  experienced considerable seismic
              unrest in 1997.  Using a  portable fluxmeter, the PI's measured CO2 emission in
              the largest  tree kill area (Horseshoe Lake) in August, 1997, and January, 
              1998. These measurements suggest that there was a significant  increase in CO2
              flux within this period.  To shed light on the  controls of CO2 degassing
              through the volcanic edifice at Mammoth  Mountain, and to monitor for volcanic
              hazard, there is a  compelling need to continuously monitor CO2 emission at
              Mammoth  Mountain.  Accordingly, this grant provides funds to purchase, 
              install and maintain equipment to continuously monitor CO2 flux  at a carefully
              chosen site in the Horseshoe Lake tree kill area  at Mammoth Mountain.  The
              continuous flux measurement system is  based on the accumulation chamber
              principle where CO2 flux is  derived from the rate of increase of CO2
              concentration  immediately following placement of the chamber on the ground 
              surface.  The continuous monitoring system automatically makes  flux
              measurements every 30 minutes and acquires and stores data  that is remotely
              transmitted via a UHF telemetry system.  The  instrumentation will be
              constructed and installed by West Systems  of Pisa, Italy, who have
              successfully installed and field tested  identical instruments in European
              localities of high CO2 flux.  Following installation and training by the West
              Systems  personnel, the P.I. and John Rogie (a Penn State graduate student 
              carrying out research on CO2 emission) will be involved in  instrument
              maintenance, and in the acquisition and interpretation  of the data. Matching
              funds for this equipment acquisition will  be provided through the Volcano
              Hazards program of the U.S.  Geological Survey.  Accordingly, this equipment
              acquisition is  enthusiastically supported by U.S.G.S. personnel wh o are
              actively  involved in surveillance of unrest at Mammoth Mountain and the  Long
              Valley caldera.  ***
