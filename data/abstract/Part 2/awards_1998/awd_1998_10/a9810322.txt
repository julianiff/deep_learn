Abstract    :
              Description:  This award in mathematics is for the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Spectral and Inverse Spectral Problems for Schroedinger Operators. 
              The collaborators are from the University of Kentucky, Brown University, and
              the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chenni. The six co-principal
              investigators will investigate aspects of the spectral properties of random
              Schroedinger operators, inverse problems for almost periodic operators, trace
              formulas for Schroedinger operators, and applications of the KAM theorem. The
              PIs will also host a small international workshop on Schroedinger operator
              theory in New Delhi.       
Scope:  This research has developed from
              productive interactions at  workshops and a summer school organized by co-PIs
              K.B. Sinha of the Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi and M. Krishna of the
              Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Madras.  The collaborators are highly
              accomplished researchers and the proposed work has high research value.
