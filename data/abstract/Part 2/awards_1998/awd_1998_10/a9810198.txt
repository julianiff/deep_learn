This project is concerned with the synthesis of new
              intercalation materials that are based primarily on vanadium oxides and extend
              to manganese and iron oxides.  These intercalation hosts will be synthesized
              using hydrothermal techniques.  It is envisioned that by appropriate choice of 
              acidity,  reaction medium, and cations, and by control of the oxygen potential
              new structures containing tunnels or channels will be formed that will offer
              novel materials with unique properties.  Diffusion / ionic mobility will be
              determined for these new materials, and they will be evaluated for
              electrochemical activity for battery or sensor use.  They will also be
              characterized for their ability to be intercalated by a variety of guest ions
              and molecules and their chemical and physical properties will be determined
              using x-ray, electrochemical, and magnetic / electrical measurements as well as
              the standard analytical techniques.

The project is part of an important
              area which will impact ion-conduction and redox active materials for battery
              and sensor applications.
