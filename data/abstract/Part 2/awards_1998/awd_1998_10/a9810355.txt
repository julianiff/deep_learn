Title: Quantum Ellipsometry



Analysis

The proposal is to
              develop a new approach to characterize the polarization parameters of optical
              and photonic materials using quantum feature of entangled and orthogonally
              polarized signal and idler photon pairs. A polarization intensity
              interferometer designed based on this principle has shown extremely high
              resolution in the attosecond time scale, and is sentive to the absorption or
              reflection of the photons travelling throught the sample.  These features allow
              the use of this technique as a quantum extension of conventional optical
              ellipsometry.
