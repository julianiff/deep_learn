Abstract    :
              This project examines how the values of American Indian students, along with
              their perceptions of societal, family and peer norms, relate to their success
              in scientific and technological training.  Scientific and technological
              education achievement and skill attainment is poorer among American Indians
              (Native Americans) than among other groups in U.S. society.  This project will
              provide further information about the influences that contribute to this
              problem, in order to help to promote increased involvement of Indian people in
              science and technology in ways that can improve their lives and communities and
              allow the larger society to benefit from their contributions. The project
              consists of two studies of norms and values that influence the educational
              performance of American Indian students.  One experimental study with college
              students tests the effect of priming ethnic identity on attitudes toward
              technology and science.   Comparison of the primed and unprimed groups will
              provide causal evidence of the effects of Indian identity on manifest ability,
              knowledge and attitudes towards science and technology.  The other study is a
              survey of high school students of ethnic attitudes to technology and science
              and their effects on choices in education.  This study will examine how
              different patterns of values and family and peer norms affect course selection
              and achievement.  Results will be published in the academic literature and
              shared with American Indian organizations, including the American Indian
              Science and Engineering Society.
