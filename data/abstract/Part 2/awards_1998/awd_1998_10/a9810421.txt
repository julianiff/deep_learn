Abstract    :
              Abstract   ANIR-9810421  PI:  Frank Miglorie  College of St. Joseph  Rutland,
              Vermont          This project connects the College of St. Joseph to the
              Internet over a T1 line. Access to the Internet would establish a two-way
              information vehicle for the College that would connect its students, faculty
              and staff to resources (research data, mentors, career opportunities, distance
              learning) beyond its rural scope. The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
