Abstract    :
              The investigator examines the role of nonlinear cross field diffusion in
              quite-time modulated flux throughout the heliosphere, using a newly developed
              fully time-dependent, three dimensional numerical solution of the standard
              cosmic ray transport equation.  Using a rigidity-sensitive estimate of
              nonlinear cross-field diffusion, he critically evaluates a drift-suppressing
              role of enhanced cross-field diffusion.  The project is relevant to
              heliospheric science and energetic particle studies, stemming from an increased
              understanding of cosmic ray modulation, a nonlinear element having profound
              implication in other magnetic turbulence studies.  This new element also
              potentially benefits space and astrophysical plasma turbulence studies, like
              cosmic ray galactic transport and diffusive shock acceleration.
