Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project investigates the role that science and
              technology played in shaping the built and natural environments of Seattle,
              Washington between 1880 and 1970.  It is designed to cast historical light on
              the creation, growth, and development of urban ecosystems.  It will also
              suggest how the reciprocal influences between science, technology, society and
              culture shape human understandings of the natural world.  It brings
              environmental history and science and technology studies together by
              investigating how the built and natural environment together comprise Seattle. 
              The project hopes to demonstrate that urban environmental concerns flow from
              historical conditions that fused the built with the natural.  More
              specifically, `Working Nature` charts how engineers, city planners, workers,
              and political leaders created the infrastructure and urban forms integral to
              Seattle's growth.  The research focuses on how material changes to Seattle's
              landscapes both reflected and affected how citizens used and understood nature.
               Scientific ideas and technological systems employed to create Seattle's urban
              environment mediated changes in the land.  They also played no small role in
              determining how residents would come to identify their city as close to nature,
              and what shape future plans for Seattle would take.  Phase one of the research
              focuses on the local primary source material for the period between 1880 and
              1940.  It will also look at records associated with Seattle's railroad
              development and park design housed in Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Washington,
              D.C.  Phase two returns to local sources, this time after World War II, to
              examine how changing attitudes toward city nature influenced attempts at
              environmental management in the face of previous landscape changes.
