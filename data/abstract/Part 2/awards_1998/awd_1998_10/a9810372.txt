Abstract    :
                This research explores legal consciousness and personal injury in a Southeast
              Asian society radically transformed by globalization.  It explores concepts  of
              self and community, injury and remedy, legal and non-legal responses to harm,
              and ideas about causation and responsibly in Chiangmai, Thailand. The research
              represents an unusual opportunity to address questions about  law, social
              change, and civil litigation that are fundamental to the field oaf law and
              social science and to extend such questions beyond  conventional  frameworks by
              asking how the intensification of global interactions affects litigation and
              other practices and perceptions of personal injuries.  Methods being used to
              collect data include textual analysis  of personal injury casefiles in the
              provincial court and in-depth interviews with individuals who have suffered
              personal injuries but have not necessarily chosen to assert a claim. 
              Additional interviews with monks, doctors, village leaders, lawyers, judges,
              litigants, and other observers who can comment on practices and perceptions
              will supplement the analysis.  This research will expand our understanding of
              the myriad of injuries, claims, negotiations, mediation, and litigation.  %%%
