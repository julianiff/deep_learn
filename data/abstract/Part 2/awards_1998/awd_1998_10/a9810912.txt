Abstract    :
              The project consists of two parts. The first part involves collaboration with
              Franklin Allen of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. The second
              part involve collaboration with Robert Rosenthal of Boston University.  Part
              one of the project addresses three aspects of optimal central bank policies to
              achieve financial stability. One is the development of a model of optimal
              intervention by a central bank when liquidity shortages cause bank runs. The
              second is the study of contagion in financial systems, that is, investigating
              how small shocks can spread throughout the banking system or from one country
              to another. The third is the role of credit policy in inflating asset prices
              and precipitating a collapse in financial markets.  The second part will
              analyze the properties of a behavioral model of learning, in which individuals
              adapt their behavior through experimentation (randomly trying new strategies)
              and imitation (adopting strategies they observe others use). The research
              involves a combination of mathematical and computational methods.  It will also
              apply adaptive algorithms to the models of markets in order to investigate the
              conditions under which simple, adaptive behavior can lead to optimal outcomes
              in competitive markets.
