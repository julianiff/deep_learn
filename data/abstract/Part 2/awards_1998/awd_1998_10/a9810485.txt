Abstract    :
              9810485  Swap    This award supports a workshop on "Southern African Land- 
              Atmosphere-Biosphere Interactions," to be held in July 1998  in South Africa. 
              Although the venue is South Africa, the  workshop encompasses the broader
              southern Africa region,  including Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe,
              Malawi,  and Botswana.  Participants from each of those countries  have been
              invited, along with participants from the United  States and South Africa.  The
              workshop is co-organized by  Robert Swap and Paul Desanker, Department of
              Environmental  Sciences, University of Virginia, and Harold Annegarn, 
              Schonland Research Centre for the Nuclear Sciences, the  University of the
              Witwatersrand.    The purpose of the workshop is to address emerging 
              interdisciplinary research needs resulting from the  integration and linking of
              southern African land cover and  land use change, atmospheric emission and
              transport, and  biogeochemical research as it relates to global change.  The 
              participants will design and develop a conceptual model that  describes
              linkages across time and space scales between  southern African terrestrial,
              atmospheric, and  biogeochemical processes.  Specialists in many fields are 
              participating, some of which are ecosystem and biosphere  modeling, remote
              sensing, woodland savanna ecology and  management, soil science, meteorology,
              climate change and  forecasting, and land use and biodiversity.  The workshop
              is  supported jointly by the Division of International Programs,  the Division
              of Atmospheric Sciences, and the Division of  Environmental Biology.  In South
              Africa, support for the  workshop is being provided by the Foundation for
              Research  Development (FRD).
