Abstract    :
              9810620  Perdew    This award supports theoretical research on the properties 
              of atoms, molecules, and solids.  The proposed work focuses  on improving the
              methods and concepts of density functional  and pseudopotential theory. 
              Specific projects include: (1)  Incorporate the second derivative in the
              generalized  gradient expansion for the exchange correlation energy in a  way
              that recovers the fourth-order gradient expansion for  the exchange energy in
              the limit of slow or long-wavelength  density fluctuations. (2) Construct a
              similar "Laplacian  level GGA" for the kinetic energy. (3) Construct an
              electron-  ion pseudopotential that provides a correct description of  the
              interaction between core and valence electrons. (4)  Develop models based on
              the generalized gradient  approximation and beyond for the exchange-correlation
              hole.  (5) Study exchange and correlation in the low-density or 
              strongly-correlated limit. (6) Test various density  functionals for the
              quasi-two-dimensional electron gas or  quantum well to see if they satisfy
              one-dimensional density  scaling. (7) Propose a simplified equation of state
              for  solids. (8) Develop and test a fully nonlocal orbital  functional for the
              correlation energy, compatible with exact  exchange.  %%%  Perdew will use
              analytical and numerical techniques to  improve density-functional based 
              theories of materials and  of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and
              solids.  The work has potential to broadly impact research efforts as  well as
              simulation methods applied to a wide variety of  materials and phenomena that
              occur in materials.  ***
