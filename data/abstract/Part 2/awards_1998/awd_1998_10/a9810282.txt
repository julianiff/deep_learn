Abstract

Proposal:  9810282				Date:  03-09-1999

The Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) is an
              institute at the University of California-Los Angeles, and is directed by Dr.
              Eitan Tadmor and Dr. Mark Green.  This institute is designed to encourage
              cross-fertilization between pure and applied mathematics and other areas of
              science.  IPAM is supported as a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and
              is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences.

IPAM will host two or
              three intensive scientific programs each year designed to forge links across
              fields.  Each program will bring in four experts and ten postdoctoral scholars
              interested in learning the area.  Half of these will be mathematicians and half
              will come from the scientific disciplines related to the program.  Each program
              will have two streams, one with a mathematical flavor and the other focusing on
              the scientific problems addressed.  A program will consist of tutorials from
              both streams, followed by seminars and conferences, and culminating in a
              one-week conference at Lake Arrowhead.

IPAM will have no permanent faculty. 
              A vertically integrated group of fourteen scholars from the mathematics and
              scientific community will spend an intensive ten-week period at IPAM being
              exposed to an interdisciplinary topic.  This group will be supplemented by a
              hundred visitors coming for shorter periods of time.
