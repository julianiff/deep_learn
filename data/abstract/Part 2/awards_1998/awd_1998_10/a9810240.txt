Abstract    :
                   ENGINEERING EXPLORATION in Phoenix, Arizona, is composed of  a superb and
              well-tested partnership of educators, practicing  scientists and engineers,
              members of professional associations,  and education advocates anchored by
              Washington Elementary School  District, the Society of Women Engineers (Phoenix
              Section), and  New Frontiers/Center for Educational Development.  This project 
              includes:  1) an introductory exploratory activity for girls and  their parents
              at the new Arizona Science Center; 2) an  "Engineering University" where girls
              and their parents learn  about different disciplines of engineering and career
              options in  each, course prerequisites for the fields of math, science and 
              engineering, and ways that they can work together to accomplish  goals
              necessary for entry into these fields; 3) an inservice for  middle school
              teachers on gender equity issues and how they can  promote maximum achievement
              of girls; and 4) follow-up classroom  visits and training for a school equity
              specialist.  This system  is Arizona's largest elementary school district, with
               approximately 26,000 students, and has a large number of high-  poverty and
              minority female students who lack role models and  family support to help them
              prepare for entering a  technologically demanding work place.  Highly skilled,
              high  paying careers in which women have been underrepresented are  currently
              not included in their career plans, because they have  had little or no
              exposure to those careers.  The overriding goal  of ENGINEERING EXPLORATION is
              to help female students become more  knowledgeable of opportunities awaiting
              them in the fields of  math, science and engineering, and to promote their
              developing  competence and confidence in their abilities to learn skills and 
              concepts related to those fields.  The project will be a major  feature on the
              agenda for the 1999 National Conference for the  Society of Women Engineers to
              be held in Phoenix.
