Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS, with the bandwidth 
              scheduled to be increased by 30 Mbps every six months until OC-3 is  reached. 
              Applications include projects in high energy physics, network  protocols and
              simulation, global climate modeling, supercomputing and  visualization courses,
              and Monte Carlo remote computing and visualization.  Collaborating institutions
              include the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,  Pittsburgh Supercomputing
              Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, National  Center for Atmospheric
              Research, San Diego Supercomputing Center and  Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory.
