Abstract    :
                   This project expands the current Women in Science and  Engineering (WISE)
              program, which focuses primarily on the first  year, into a four-year
              experience, to be known as the WISE  College.        Important academic and
              social components are introduced to  create an entity with which the women will
              identify during their  four years at Stony Brook and beyond.  Goals are to
              institute  advanced math and computer training and an ongoing in-depth 
              research experience; to introduce newly-developed courses that   give insight
              into the cultural milieu in which science operates  and scientists work; to
              sustain and deepen the sense of belonging  to a community of active women
              scientists; and to facilitate  movement from college to graduate or
              professional school in SME.   Methods for achieving these goals include:  the
              introduction of  advanced math/computer requirements; the implementation of 
              specially-created courses on the Social Dimensions of Science,  Connections in
              Science; and Problem Solving; the development and  implementation of a
              Mentoring seminar and enhanced mentoring  opportunities for the women; and a
              two-year intensive research  requirement, accompanied by a senior seminar on
              Professional  Development and professionally-oriented activities such as 
              presentations at conferences, a major paper, and grant-writing  activities.  By
              providing a structured and supportive environment  for four years, and
              instituting elements designed to enhance the  women's academic and professional
              development, WISE College will  address national and local needs to recruit and
              especially to  retain qualified women in SME and to increase the number of
              women  pursuing careers that require training in science, math or  technology.
