Abstract    :
                This project is focusing on how international trade negotiators and regulators
              who make decisions on trade issues that impact on other social-political issues
              such as the degradation of the environment, take account of the views of
              interest groups.  Specifically, this research is analyzing the tradeoffs,
              constraints, and potential pathologies of permitting increased access to
              private parties to the primary international trade body,  the World Trade
              Organization  (WTO).  This research takes the `stakeholders` model of
              governance beyond its current descriptive state with an analysis grounded on
              the manner in which the WTO takes account of trade and environmental matters to
              evaluate tradeoffs, constraints, and potential pathologies (e.g., favoring
              certain private interests to others' detriment).  The primary method being used
              to collect data uses interviews with key members of the WTO secretariat, a
              sample of WTO delegates from state governments representing differing levels of
              development and geographic location, representatives of intergovernmental
              organizations, and representatives of not-for-profit and business
              organizations.  In addition, all public documents related to WTO Committee on
              Trade and Environment are being analyzed. The project results will provide
              scholars, policy makers and citizens with a much better understanding of how
              the WTO receives and processes information from third parties and how it
              distributes information to  actors who have stakes in its decisions.    %%%
