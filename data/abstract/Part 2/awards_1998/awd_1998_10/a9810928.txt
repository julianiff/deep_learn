              ABSTRACT

OCE-9810928

The oceanic balance between the influx of alkalinity
              from rivers and the loss by burial of calcite in seafloor sediments can
              determine the partial pressure of carbon dioxide of the surface ocean, and thus
              of the atmosphere, on glacial-interglacial time scales.  The magnitude of the
              effect is very sensitive to the factors that drive the dissolution of calcium
              carbonate and the mechanisms of dissolution on the sea floor.  In this study
              the principal investigator would collaborate with several other marine
              carbonate experts in an attempt to help resolve a major question in this field:
               the kinetics and relative importance of calcite dissolution by respiratory
              processes and by simple dissolution/precipitation.  By following oxygen, pH,
              and carbonate measurements in in-situ benthic chambers and through back-up
              laboratory studies of calcite precipitation/dissolution kinetics, the principal
              investigator anticipates that he will be able to address this problem by
              eliminating uncertainties inherent in similar studies conducted to date.
