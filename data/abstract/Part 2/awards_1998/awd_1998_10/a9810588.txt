Abstract    :
              9810588  Storm    In light of recent progress in the design and manipulation 
              ceramic materials using processing-microstructure-property  relations, the
              theme of the 1998 Gordon Research Conference  on Solid State Studies in
              Ceramics is "Tailored Ceramics-  Fundamental Challenges in
              Processing-Microstructure-Property  Relations."  The goals of the GRC in 1998
              are two-fold.  First, to explore the current status of 
              processing-microstructureproperty relations as a means of  determining what is
              missing.  The problem is to explore at  what level of interrogation do we
              understand processing,  microstructure and properties.  The second goal of the 
              meeting is to explore basic science advances and needs over  the full spectrum
              of technical ceramics like ferroelectrics  and optical ceramics.  Although
              properties are established  by different physics, the underlying 
              processing-microstructureproperty themes are similar.  The  overall goal is to
              explore these common themes, discover new  opportunities, develop synergy and
              to cross-fertilize the  fields.  %%%  The invited speakers at the 1998 Gordon
              Research Conference  on Solid State Studies in Ceramics on "Tailored Ceramics- 
              Fundamental Challenges in Processing- Microstructure-  Property Relations" will
              be challenged to answer the  question of what scientific questions are still
              outstanding  in regards to tailoring ceramics.  Time is allotted to fully 
              explore the thoughts and visions of the speakers and the  audience.  In this
              manner the conferees will explore in  depth the current status of the technical
              ceramics field  which will allow us to project what type of research is  needed
              to make significant progress in designing and  producing tailored ceramics.
