This project will continue the Long-term Ecological Research
              (LTER) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in an effort to improve general
              understanding of the mutual influences of environment, disturbance, biological
              activity and the flows of energy and materials in forest landscapes. This
              integrated program of long-term monitoring and process-level studies at Hubbard
              Brook and other regional sites address a series of hypotheses in two thematic
              categories: biogeochemistry and vegetation dynamics. The biogeochemical studies
              focus on the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and sulfur and build
              especially upon a 30+ year record of fluxes from the Hubbard Brook Experimental
              watersheds to address several striking and surprising observations about
              element cycling in northeastern forests. In addition, investigations of
              vegetation and primary productivity at the landscape scale will be expanded,
              focusing upon the interactions between tree spatial distributions, soil and
              glacial till properties, and nitrogen cycling and nutrition. This research will
              be synthesized and integrated using simulation models and in the form of
              monographic overviews of elemental cycles.
