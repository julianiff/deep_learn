Abstract    :
              Traditional composite shear walls consist of a plate with a concrete wall on one
              or both sides of the steel plate and boundary columns and beams.  By properly
              combining the advantages of the reinforced concrete and steel plate shear
              walls, and by eliminating or reducing their disadvantages, and efficient
              composite shear wall system can result such as innovative version of the
              composite shear wall systems, had great potential to become a very efficient
              and high performance lateral lead resisting system.  This project will study
              and develop seismic design recommendations for the wall systems.  
The
              following interrelated analytical and experimental investigations will be
              conducted.

Inelastic finite element parametric studies of the traditional
              composite shear walls and the new system,

Parametric inelastic time-history
              analyses of the global and local seismic responses of structures with both
              types of shear walls

Cyclic tests of four two-story specimens representing
              composite shear wall systems,

Developing seismic design recommendations for
              composite shear wall systems,

Finally, after design recommendations have
              been formulated, the recommendations will be applied to design of at least two
              structures with composite shear walls.  Then, inelastic time history response
              analysis of the structures will be conducted to verify desirable performance of
              the structures. .
