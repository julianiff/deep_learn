Abstract    :
              

     For the past two years a team of 8 investigators at the University of
              Florida has identified Uninhabited Air Vehicles (UAVs) have applications in
              both military and civilian roles.  With emergence of MEMS sensors and the
              miniaturization of video cameras, Macs can be used for rescue and hostage
              situations, gathering of meteorological information, obtaining data during
              poisonous chemical spills and virus outbreaks, and obvious military
              applications without endangering investigators.
     As a proof of concept, it
              is proposed that a prototype flexible/soft wing be built for a UAV experiments
              will be performed in order to evaluate and optimize the design, Strategies for
              future implementation of MEMS sensors and smart materials for actuation will
              also be investigated by determining how wing reconfiguration affects avoidance
              of flow separation.
