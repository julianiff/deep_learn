Abstract    :
              This award supports a US-South Africa  cooperative research project entitled
              Physiological Ecology of Ixodid Ticks: Water Balance and Behavior.  The
              principal investigators are Glen R. Needham, Department of Entomology, Ohio
              State University, and Leon Fourie, Department of Zoology and Entomology,
              University of the Orange Free State (UOFS), Bloemfontein, South Africa.  The
              research focuses on two critical issues for a terrestrial arthropod:  the water
              uptake mechanism and the behaviors associated with water balance.  The
              investigators will study how ticks survive for long periods without eating or
              drinking water while waiting or searching for a host to parasitize.  This
              longevity makes ticks unique in that they serve both as potential vectors and
              reservoirs of disease.  Dr. Fourie has a unique setting to study one of the
              richest tick faunas in the world, in which the entire spectrum of survival
              strategies for long off-host periods is found.  The project combines the field
              and laboratory experience of the investigator and his students at UOFS with the
              US investigator's expertise in tick water balance physiology.
