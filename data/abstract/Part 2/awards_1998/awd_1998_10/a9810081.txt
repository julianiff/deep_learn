Abstract    :
              ECS-9810081  Khammash    In recent years, the North American Electric
              Interconnection has undergone major changes with the advent of a competitive
              market place, and deregulation.  These changes will impose new requirements on
              system operation and planning. It is likely that the emergence of open access,
              and wheeling of power in a competitive market place will drive the need to
              operate and plan the system at higher levels of loading, leading to further
              stress on the system.  To a large extent, adequate system dynamic performance
              will depend on the proper operation and performance of critical controls. 
              Proper design and robust performance of these controls are essential for the
              reliable operation of the interconnected power system.  This proposal deal with
              development of techniques to apply modern robust control methods to design and
              analyze controls for large scale power systems.    We propose to extend
              existing methods of robust stability analysis to deal with large scale power
              system problems.  Specifically we intend to use the Structured Singular Value
              approach, and develop analytical and numerical techniques to exploit the
              structural characteristics of large power systems.  We will investigate and
              develop numerical techniques which are suitable for large scale problems.  The
              developments would involve issues related to uncertainty characterization and
              parameter selection, frequency sweeps, state space methods utilizing branch and
              bound techniques, and efficient techniques for control synthesis.  The methods
              developed will be applied to realistic test systems obtained from two North
              American Electric Utilities.
