Abstract    :
              The goal of this Small Grants Exploratory Research project is to  find the
              optimal number of stages for the shuffle connected  multistage interconnected
              network (MIN) to be rearrangeable.  The  approach is to use a new theoretical
              model which defines a  necessary and sufficient condition for routing a
              permutation  through the MIN.
