              Abstract  ATM-9810610  Bierly, Eugene W.  American Geophysical Union  Title:
              U.S. National Office for Earth Systems History (ESH)    This award supports the
              management structure for coordination of U.S. research activities in connection
              with the Earth System History (ESH) Project of the United States Global Change
              Research Program (USGCR).  The ESH Secretariat at the American Geophysical
              Union (AGU) will provide support services for the ESH Steering Committee and a
              point of interaction and contact with the international effort in Past Global
              Changes (PAGES) of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). 
              These efforts will include  activities designed to generate paleoscience
              community input to ESH Project priorities and objectives.  Workshops, planning
              meetings and publications will insure that the goals of the project are met and
              that implementation of  the project is carried out in an effective manner.
