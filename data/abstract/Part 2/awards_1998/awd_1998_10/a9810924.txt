Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project seeks to uncover sex differences in
              success in prestigious financial careers. The existence of a "glass ceiling"
              blocking women's advancement in organizations has been well-documented, however
              the processes that create this ceiling effect are not well-understood. "Wall
              Street" financial institutions represent a new and important frontier in glass
              ceiling research. The proposed research will address several questions: (1) To
              what extent do co-worker and/or client relationships influence success, and are
              there sex differences in this influence? (2) How does the work environment
              affect women's and men's careers? (3) To what extent are barriers to women's
              success related to social pressures outside of work? (4) Compared to men, what
              obstacles do women face early in their careers? (5) Are there gender
              differences in turnover and, if so, what accounts for them? Answers to these
              questions will be sought through in-depth interviews with men and women who
              entered investment banking careers as associates in Wall Street's most
              prestigious investment banks during the early 1990s. The project should
              accomplish several goals: It will (1) provide a unique, systematic comparison
              of men and women who begin their careers from similar backgrounds; (2) shed
              light on the processes that operate to maintain glass ceilings; (3) employ a
              systematic analysis of informal networks, the importance of which only has been
              documented anecdotally; (4) allow an important comparison between individuals
              who are successful and those who leave the career--a comparison not considered
              by most glass ceiling research; and (5) represent the first study of employment
              patterns and interpersonal dynamics in elite Wall Street firms.
