Abstract    :
              9810244  Piccoli    This award provides 29% of the funding required for the
              acquisition  of an electron microprobe microanalyzer system to be installed and
               operated at the Center for Microanalysis at the University of  Maryland. The
              instrument will be used by research faculty, as well  as graduate and
              undergraduate students to perform a variety of  microanalytical tasks applied
              to research in geology, geochemistry,  ore genesis, industrial and
              environmental mineralogy, materials  science, ceramics, chemistry and solid
              state physics.  ***
