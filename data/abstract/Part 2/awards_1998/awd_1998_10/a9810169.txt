Abstract    :
              Written language differs fundamentally from spoken language, and reading
              consequently involves some skills with no obvious counterpart in spoken
              language processing.  The objective of this project is to understand skills
              that are unique to reading.  Comprehending text requires that readers obtain
              useful information from an extended set of spatially ordered words.  This is
              accomplished by moving the eyes to different segments of text, and using the
              viewed text to identify the words.  The project will employ state-of-the-art
              eye-recording technologies in conjunction with sophisticated text display
              manipulations to examine word recognition during individual eye fixations, how
              word recognition during a fixation is used to program an eye movement to new
              text, and how information obtained during one fixation is integrated with
              information obtained during prior and successive fixations so that a relatively
              cohesive accrual of information is accomplished over successive fixations. 
              Results of the proposed work should define processes essential to skilled
              reading, and should have implications for understanding of reading abilities
              that may be unrelated to speech comprehension abilities.  The studies should
              also have broad methodological ramifications, as eye movement measures are
              being used in a wide range of domains, including picture and scene perception,
              speech perception, memory retrieval, and in industrial testing.
