Abstract    :
              The study addresses various past claims about the importance of
              telecommunication flows in modern spatial economies. Such claims have rarely
              been subject to empirical scrutiny, and this study is an empirical project with
              two specific aims: (1) To uncover the spatial structure and socio-economic
              determinants of regional, point-to-point telecommunication flows; and (2) to
              understand the economic and locational impacts of telecommunications on urban
              and regional systems. The empirical analysis makes use of a 5% random sample of
              all telephone calls within a region carrying details of callers, locations
              called, business sector (if applicable) etc. These data are to be matched with
              a variety of census materials to examine telecommunications demand and
              resulting regional economic impacts. GIS tools are used for the database
              matching. New spatial interaction models of telecommunication flows will be
              specified and estimated, and then used to examine flow elasticities with
              respect to distance and prices. In addition, inter-industry links will be
              explored, especially the role of spatial structure and how these interactions
              vary over time.  A model will be developed of the impacts of telecommunications
              on rural development, office relocation, work at home, and urban
              interdependencies (i.e., changes in the urban hierarchy).  The results of the
              study are important to the formulation of policies on infrastructure
              modernization, reduction of regional inequalities, and decentralization of
              economic activities.
