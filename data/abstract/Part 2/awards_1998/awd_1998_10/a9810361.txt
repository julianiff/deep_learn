The
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is located in
Berkeley,
              California and is directed by Dr. David Eisenbud.  The
primary missions of the
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
are a) to stimulate and propagate new
              work in the Mathematical
Sciences through broadly based programs and workshops
              in a
variety of fields of Mathematical Sciences, and b) to serve as a
center
              for postdoctoral education.  The Institute accomplishes
these ends primarily
              by assembling a variety of researchers in a
programmatically focussed
              environment.  These scientists include
long- and short-term visitors who are
              selected from the leaders
in the fields of interest, as well as postdocs and
              other young
researchers. This award includes funding for
              postdoctoral
fellows, whose mentoring is an important part of the
              Institute's
activities.  Secondary missions include the communication
              of
mathematical science both within and outside the mathematical
community
              and the development of human resources in the
Mathematical Sciences.

MSRI
              hosts scientific programs on short (one weekend to a few
weeks) and long
              (semester and academic year) time scales.  The
Institute has no permanent
              faculty or research personnel and
anchors the participant lists for major
              programs in a base of
distinguished visiting members and one- or two-year
              postdoctoral
researchers.  Topics for the long programs are drawn from
              the
broad range of mathematical sciences and repeat infrequently.
Many of the
              lectures and other presentations at MSRI are
publically available on the World
              Wide Web through streaming
video or lecture notes (http://www.msri.org).  The
              Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley is supported by the
              NSF
as a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, funded by the
Division of
              Mathematical Sciences.
