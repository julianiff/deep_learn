Abstract    :
              9810545  Ghindilis   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
              project will aim to develop a single stage, fast, reagentless immuno-assay
              technique and instrumentation.  The approach will allow a design of a family of
              assay tools for determination of a wide range of analytes (e.g. different
              environmental pollutants, drugs, toxins, peptides, proteins, viruses, whole
              cells, bacteria, etc.) for biomedical diagnostics, veterinary, food quality
              control, environmental monitoring and control, research investigation, and
              special purposes.  The advantages of the proposed immuno-assay instrumentation
              over existing conventional immuno-assay techniques are:  (1) a solid,
              immuno-sensor utilizing simple single stage assay procedure of short assay time
              (30-60 minutes); (2) reagentless procedure; (3) low requirements to a
              professional skill of a user; (4) portable equipment; and (5) assay performance
              under laboratory conditions.   The proposed technology will be used for
              environmental monitoring and control, food quality control, biomedical
              diagnostics, veterinary controls, research investigations, and special
              purposes.
