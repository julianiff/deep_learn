Abstract    :
                Presently, 38 states, the U.S. government, and the U.S. military enforce the
              death penalty.  During 1997, 74 people were executed in the United States,
              while over 3200 others awaited capital punishment on death row.  An even larger
              number of cases were tried unsuccessfully.  The research tests several
              hypotheses, underscored by the latest Supreme Court death penalty decision in
              Buchanan v. Angelone (1998), about the impact of instructions and arguments by
              counsel on jurors' understanding and use of mitigation evidence.  In addition,
              the research will explore the impact of jury deliberations on the outcome
              decision.  Death qualified community residents and student mock jurors are
              participating in a capital penalty hearing.  Jurors are randomly assigned to
              treatment conditions.  The results will help understand jurors' understanding
              of mitigating and aggravating circumstances.    %%%  Presently, 38 states, the
