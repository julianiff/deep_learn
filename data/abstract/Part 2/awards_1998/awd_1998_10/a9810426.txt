Abstract    :
                This project begins a systematic and comprehensive analysis of factors related
              to the success of international environmental institutions and global
              environmental laws.  The first phase of the project brings together an expert
              panel to offer, through and invited conference, a framework for understanding
              law's role and to make recommendations for improving the performance of
              international legal instruments of environmental protections. Conference
              participants will present formal commissioned papers reviewing lessons learned
              from international environmental law efforts, and will participate in plenary
              discussion.  They  will analyze two key cases with experts addressing questions
              aimed at understanding the degree of success for the international instruments.
               Finally, the participants will generate hypotheses to be tested in subsequent
              phases of the research. The subsequent phases will use survey research and
              field observation to explore sociolegal components of global environmental law.
