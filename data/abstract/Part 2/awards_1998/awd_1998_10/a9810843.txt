Abstract    :
              This dissertation project proposes to conduct research on the success of Dutch
              science shops.  Science shops in the Netherlands are university departments
              that solicit questions from community advocacy groups - labor unions,
              environmental groups, patient support groups, and the like - and find students
              and researchers within the university who can answer the questions.  This
              project posits that the Dutch science shops are effective because they enhance
              participation of scientists in local communities; increase citizen
              understanding of, participation in, and empowerment regarding science, and
              increase client support of science. The project proposes field research in the
              Netherlands, comparing the experiences of science shops in order to identify
              the determinants of success.  The primary method of the study is participant
              observation at two primary and three secondary sites (all science shops)
              supported by interviews.  Archival sources from the science shops and
              government periodicals will be used to document policy changes which have
              resulted from science shop work, including policies that were advocated by
              client groups as a result of science shop research.  Two questionnaires - one
              at the beginning of the research and one at the end - mailed to all forty Dutch
              science shops will inform and verify data collected at the participant
              observation stage.
