Description: This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Dr. Ronald Eshleman, Director of the Vibration Institute in Chicago,
              Illinois and Dr. Aly El-Shafei, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering
              at Cairo University and Managing Director of RITEC, a Research, Industrial,
              Training and Educational services Company in Cairo, Egypt.  The two plan to
              develop predictive maintenance management software to aid industries in Egypt
              and in the United States in implementing superior condition-based maintenance
              strategies.  In addition to the software, they will investigate communication
              channels and data base structures for condition monitoring and maintenance
              management software, and will also investigate the decision support mechanisms
              to provide work order initiation based on machinery condition.

Scope:  This
              award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists who have
              significant complementary technical background and expertise to carry out the
              proposed project.  The Vibration Institute is a main source of information on
              available technologies for vibration analyses and its staff has extensive
              experience in machinery analysis and condition monitoring.  The Egyptian
              scientist leads a strong team in vibration analyses and software development. 
              This project will provide a new advanced tool to manufacturers and machinery
              maintenance organizations to efficiently schedule maintenance and reduce costs
              for services and for replacements of expensive machinery.  This proposal meets
              the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit
              both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund
              Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to
              carry out these cooperative activities.
