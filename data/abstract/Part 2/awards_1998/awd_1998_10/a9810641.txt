Abstract    :
                9810641  Hogg    The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a
              four-year project that   addresses a critical ocean sciences requirement for
              enhancing long-term environmental   observations in the deep ocean using
              moorings.  Recent advances in materials, electronics,   and communications
              technology suggest that significant improvements can be made over   present
              capabilities.  The PIs propose a four-year project to develop a replacement for
              the   subsurface mooring that: (1) is less expensive and requires fewer,
              skilled people to prepare   and deploy, (2) is sufficiently reliable and power
              conservative that deployments of five   years or more will be possible, (3)
              telemeters its data back to the scientist, and, (4) is   mechanically
              simplified to the point that deployment can be done from a vessel of  
              opportunity. Ultimately, an expendable mooring may be achievable.    The
              development effort is based on the premise that measurements of ocean currents
              and   other variables will continue to be of fundamental importance to
              advancing our   understanding of the ocean and the development and
              implementation of models capable of   predicting its future state, as well as
              understanding its present and past conditions. The   development of an
              efficient, reliable, and long-lived mooring system will make it possible   to
              attack many problems that previously it would have been futile to consider, but
              which   have become increasingly important as the field moves to global,
              climate change issues.
