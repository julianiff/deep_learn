Abstract    :
              9810914  Humayun  This research is a component of a collaborative project 
              between Johns Hopkins University and North Carolina State  University to
              develop a retinal prosthesis.  This proposal  is concerned with components that
              will interface with the  multiple unit artificial retina chipset designed by
              the  investigators.  Specifically, this research will design and  develop the
              electrode array, the hermetic sealing process  for the implanted components,
              the video camera and video  processing circuitry, and perform biological
              testing.  ***
