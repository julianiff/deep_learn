Abstract    :
              9810717  Rosenthal         This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will
              support  collection and analysis of bottom-water and surface-sediment  samples
              along depth transects off the Hawaiian Islands.  The  PIs will analyze Cd, Ba,
              Sr, and Mg concentrations in the  water samples and in  live and dead benthic
              forminifera.  This will (a) determine whether the organisms secrete their 
              shells in equilibrium with the water, (b) determine whether  the original
              signal is altered by early diagenesis and (c)  provide baseline data for
              analysis of older sediments,  representing past conditions of ocean circulation
              under  different climate states.
