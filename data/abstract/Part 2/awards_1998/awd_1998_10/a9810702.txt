The National Academy of Sciences has accepted
              a proposal form Nirenberg and Brezis for a NAS Colloquium on Nonlinear Partial
              Differential Equations and Applications to take place January 4-8, 1999 at the
              Beckman Center of the NAS in Irvine, California. It was decided that this
              particular meeting should also serve as a school on recent developments in the
              field for younger mathematicians, graduate students and postdocs.  The purpose
              of this award is to support the younger US attendees.
