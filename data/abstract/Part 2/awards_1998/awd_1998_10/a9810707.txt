Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop and deploy an all-sky imager for detecting proton
              aurora.  The imager will provide wavelength resolution to determine the Doppler
              profile of the hydrogen auroral emissions produced by charge exchange of
              precipitating protons.  The wavelength resolution will aid in separating the
              hydrogen emissions (proton aurora) from other auroral emissions, which can be
              very intense in comparison and have been troublesome in past hydrogen aurora
              measurements.    The observation of the Doppler shift will also allow the
              inversion of the line of sight velocity distribution of the precipitating
              protons.  The design of the instrument enables effective elimination of
              background emissions without losing the spatial information available from an
              all-sky camera field-of-view.  The instrument will be constructed and tested in
              the laboratory in the first year of the project.  Then it will be fielded at a
              high latitude auroral station, such as Poker Flat, Alaska.  The distribution of
              proton aurora will be used to infer the dynamics of the closed field line
              region of the magnetosphere and its response to magnetospheric substorms and
              changes in the solar wind.
