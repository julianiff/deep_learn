Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9810358  Raymond Morris    The objectives of WISE 2000 is to
              support the participant of two additional engineering students each year in the
              1998-2000 Washington Internships for Students of Engineering (WISE) programs. 
              The NSF grant will be used to help facilitate the participation of students
              from underrepresented minority groups and currently underrepresented
              engineering disciplines to make the program truly multidisciplinary and diverse
              as we move forward into the 21st century.    Since 1980, the WISE program has
              brought up to 18 students each summer-a total of 263 thus far-to Washington, DC
              to learn first-hand how engineers can contribute to important public policy
              debates.    The return on investment has been realized very quickly.  For
              example, within five years of participating in the Program, Paul Faeth received
              an award for his contribution to the development of the Reagan administration's
              farm legislation.  Brad Mitchell, a 1984 WISE intern, advised President Bush on
              science and technology policy issues and served as a White House liaison with
              the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Recent WISE interns
              garnered a Rhodes Scholarship, three Fulbright Grants, and a Top 10 College
              Women Award.  The most important contribution that the WISE alumni body has
              made over the past eighteen years has been its continued involvement in
              engineering and public policy beyond their ten-week summer programs.  In a
              recent survey, an overwhelming 77 percent of our former interns are involved in
              "Public Policy" in some form.  As one former intern said, "I fully believe that
              the WISE Program affected my career and educational choices, primarily by
              providing the opportunity to see the numerous options available to me.  My
              experience in WISE showed me that engineers can, and should, make a difference
              in public policy."    The engineering community believes in the role of the
              WISE Program and the importance of engineer' involvement in helping develop new
              and better laws and regulation s in this technologically changing society. 
              Continued sponsorship by the engineering societies and NSF will ensure that
              this student program will continue to flourish and make positive contributions
              into the 21st century.  ***
