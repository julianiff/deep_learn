Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project focuses on the controversies surrounding
              William Herschel's observations on double stars, nebulae, and the planets. 
              Herschel  parted company with contemporary astronomers by attending to the
              appearance of celestial objects rather than to measuring their positions.  As
              most eighteenth-century astronomers were equipped with small aperture
              refractors, rather than the large reflectors Herschel employed, many were
              unable to resolve the objects Herschel reported.  The unconventional nature of
              Herschel's instrumentation and observing practices made it difficult for other
              observers to evaluate his claims.  Were the stars he observed really double, or
              was their `doubleness` an artifact of his telescopes?  Herschel sought to make
              his catalogue of double stars the test of the `goodness` of the telescope, but
              as the doubleness of many of these stars was itself in dispute, the debate over
              the meaning of resolution continued well into the nineteenth century.  One way
              in which Herschel sought to convince other astronomers of the reality of his
              findings was to make reflecting telescopes for them, much as Galileo had done
              in the seventeenth century.  While Herschel's commercial telescope venture is
              commonly treated as distinct from his `more important astronomical endeavors,
              this dissertation research project will argue on the contrary that the business
              is a crucial and unexplored dimension of his astronomy.  By making telescopes
              for others, Herschel helped to ensure the acceptance and diffusion of his
              cosmological speculations.
