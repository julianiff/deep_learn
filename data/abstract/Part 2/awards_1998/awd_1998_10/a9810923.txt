Abstract    :
              9810923  White  This research and education program addresses the study of
              quantum charge transport and storage in ultra-thin, hetero-insulator,
              nanostructures for application in high density, low-power, low voltage,
              nonvolatile semiconductor memories (NVSM's), application specific integrated
              circuits (ASIC's) and low-voltage, low power, scaled CMOS circuits.  Our
              studies focus on charge trapping in ultra-thin dielectrics with a combination
              of novel test structures and charge pumping experiments to determine the
              spatial and energetic trap distributions in the region near the Si-Si02
              interface.  Unique test structures and instrumentation are employed to examine
              the endurance of scaled novel SONOS nonvolatile memory nanostructures in their
              erase and write modes.  In the case of ultra-thin dielectrics for scaled CMOS
              devices our research addresses stress-induced leakage currents (SILC) and
              trap-assisted tunneling.  The PI's research employs advanced fabrication
              techniques, such as RTA oxidation of nitrogen implanted silicon, and analytical
              characterization techniques, such as AFM and angle-resolved XPS, to form and
              analyze the spatial and compositional structure of these ultra-thin
              dielectrics.  The above research will lead to an understanding of charge
              trapping in ultra-thin dielectrics and advanced semiconductor devices while
              providing a strong educational program in scaled NVSM and CMOS devices.  ***
