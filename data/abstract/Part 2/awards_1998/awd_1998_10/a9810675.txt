Abstract    :
              9810675   Hook, James   Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology   
              Special Project: Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science    This
              award partially supports students and travel to a workshop on   Foundational
              Methods in Computer Science that will bring together   researchers working in
              category theory and computer science to foster more   development on the middle
              ground where theory meets practice.  Hosted by   the Pacific Software Research
              Center (PacSoft) at the Oregon Graduate   Institute of Science and Technology,
              the workshop will be held on May   29-31, 1998 with emphasis on seeking out
              applications and making ``tools''   of categories more accessible to computer
              scientists.    The workshop begins with a day of tutorials aimed at students,
              educators   and newcomers to category theory, followed by a day and a half of
              research   talks.  In bringing together leaders in the field of category theory
              with   leaders in the field of computer science, the workshop offers the  
              possibility of disseminating advanced techniques at a much deeper level of  
              understanding than could be achieved through the literature alone.
