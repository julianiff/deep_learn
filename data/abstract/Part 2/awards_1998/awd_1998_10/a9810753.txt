Abstract    :
              The P.I. will continue working on the development of software programs necessary
              to augment the great advances in high performance computing especially for
              calculating, from first principles, chemical reactions rate constants.  The
              main objectives are (1) the development of a direct dynamics software package
              that integrates a variational transition state theory (VTST) package with a
              parallel electronic structure code and (2)  use of this tool to calculate the
              react rate constants for the chemical reactions involved in the ozone depletion
              process in the Antarctic and Arctic stratosphere.  The computationally complex
              part of computing reaction rates is the generation of a potential energy
              surface.  Methods such as VTST simplify this process by using only the
              potential in the vicinity of the reaction path.
