Abstract    :
              BREEDLOVE, SM  IBN 98-10342    The proposed project will study changes in the
              structure of  the nervous system that  mediate changes in behavior.  These 
              experiments take advantage of a model system in which there  is normally
              occurring plasticity induced by the seasons.  In  seasonal breeders such as the
              Siberian hamster (Phodopus  sungorus), animals born in the Fall show a much
              slower pace  of development than do animals born in the Spring.  Likewise,
              adult animals will, come autumn, undergo a nearly  complete shut down of
              reproductive systems and then, when  Spring returns, the reproductive system
              becomes functional  again.  Other researchers have demonstrated that these same
               phenomena can be reproduced in the laboratory by  manipulating a single
              environmental variable: hours of  exposure to light each day.  Most animals
              will show these  same changes simply by exposing them to either winter-like 
              short days or summer-like  long days, even if ample food,  water and warmth are
              provided.  Pilot data   indicate that  such photoperiodic manipulations also
              affect the structure  and function of spinal motor centers crucial for 
              reproduction in male hamsters.  Experiments will investigate  how photoperiod
              affects the structure and function of spinal  motoneurons both in adulthood and
              in development.  Understanding how benign, non-invasive environmental 
              manipulations affect neuronal plasticity in these animals  could shed light on
              neuronal plasticity in other  circumstances and in other species.
