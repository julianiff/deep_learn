Abstract    :
              9810362  Bewley    This grant supports interviews of numerous business people,
              salesmen, purchasing agents, and distributors in many industries in order to
              learn how product prices are set and above all how they adapt to changes in
              costs and demand.  The emphasis will not be on the quantitative description of
              price behavior but on who makes pricing decisions, how buyers and sellers
              interact, and, above all, why decisions are made.  The interviewer will also
              inquire about how inflationary expectations are formed and how these affect
              pricing decisions.  The goal of this project is to contribute to macroeconomic
              policy analysis by providing knowledge of the microeconomic mechanisms linking
              inflation to the general level of economic activity.  The project will also
              generate theoretical and empirical hypotheses that could be tested using other
              kinds of information, and especially quantitative data.
