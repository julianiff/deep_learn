Abstract    :
              Malnutrition and undernutrition are common problems in the developing world.  In
              the Marshall Islands adult obesity is also common.  This proposal studies a
              striking situation, of undernutrition and stunting in Marshallese children
              while adults in the same households are obese.  The focus of the study by a
              cultural  anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University will be the
              intrahousehold food allocation patterns in a sample of Marshallese households. 
              Using a combination of methods including macro-level analysis of structural
              factors such as remittance payments as well as micro-level ethnographic
              analysis of individual behavior in households, comparing households across a
              range of socioeconomic class statuses, the study will focus on completing a
              previously-studied sample of households ranging from urban, peri-urban,
              semi-remote, and remote locations; conduct ethnographic research on key
              concepts of nutrition, health, child growth, activity patterns and food
              distribution, and a structured interview of 260 households.  The study will
              combine theory from ecology, ethnomedicine, and medical anthropology to
              determine the causes of variation in intra-household food allocation. The new
              knowledge to be created will advance our general understanding of household
              decision-making and resource allocation in this context and will be useful to
              health planners concerned about child health in the developing world.
