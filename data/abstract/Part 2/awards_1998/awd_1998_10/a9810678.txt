Abstract    :
                    9810678  Kutter  centrifuge model testing is an important tool for
              earthquake  engineers to help understand the engineering deformation and 
              failure of soils and foundations and their interaction with  structures. 
              Physical models of these failure and deformation  problems can be constructed
              and tested while they spin on a  centrifuge.  The centrifuge acceleration field
              increased the  "self weight" of models so that stresses in the model are
              similar  to those in typical prototypes.  Because soils have nonlinear 
              material properties, the similarity of stresses in model and  prototype greatly
              enhances the accuracy of the model tests.  The  centrifuge is an extremely
              valuable tool for systematic studies  of the effects of earthquakes on soils
              and soil-structure  interaction.    The new geotechnical centrifuge in Hong
              Kong will provide a  unique opportunity for engineers to obtain data to study
              the  effects of two directional (2-D) shaking on soils and soil-  structure
              systems.  This project will organize an international  symposium to allow
              researchers in Asia and the U.S. and other  parts of the world to exchange
              experiences in soil dynamics  research in general and centrifuge model testing
              in particular.   The workshop will open the possibility of future collaboration
               including the sharing of data and facilities and the planning of 
              complementary research programs.  The possibilities and plans for  networking
              of the Hong Kong centrifuge with U.S. and  international geotechnical
              earthquake engineering facilities, as  an extension of the MRE/ 15 HPS concept,
              will also be discussed  in the symposium.  ***
