Abstract    :
                  9810012  Wallace  Structural walls/cores are commonly used to provide
              lateral  strength and stiffness in regions of moderate-to-high seismic  risk in
              the United States.  For taller building, story deep  trusses at one or more
              locations over the height of the buildings  are commonly used to couple the
              core walls and the perimeter  frame.     The behavior of hybrid/composite walls
              systems depends primarily  on the behavior and modeling of the core walls, the
              steel frame,  and the foundation, as well as the interaction between these 
              systems.  A Thorough understanding of each of these system  components is
              required before reliable design requirements can be  drafted.    Experimental
              research for hybrid wall systems (HOISE) involves  large-scale testing of
              T-shaped walls subjected to reversed  cyclic lateral loads and axial load will
              be conducted.  The  analytical component of the research involves evaluation
              and  development of inelastic modeling options for HOISE.  Analysis  modules
              will be created and documented for use with any  analytical platform.  The
              objective is to develop tools that can  be integrated into a variety of
              applications/programs without  major modifications.  The models, as well as
              other models  required to conduct complete building studies will be implemented
               into a general purpose program for the final phase of the  research.  Finally
              analytical studies of complete building  systems to study element demands and
              core wall - frame  interaction and system studies to assess the economics of
              using  HOISE in regions of high seismic risk will be conducted.    The project
              is supported under the fourth year competition NSF-  94-154.  ***
