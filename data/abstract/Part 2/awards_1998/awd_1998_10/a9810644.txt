              conference designed as a national forum on doctoral programs in mathematics
              education.  The conference of will be preceded by a year of planning that will
              include a survey of students, faculty, and employers served by those receiving
              doctoral degrees in mathematics education.  A national known and balanced (by
              ethnicity, mission of their institution, and geography) Organizing Committee
              will plan for the conference and complete the survey analysis described above. 
                The conference will host 50 participants in October, 1999.  Conference papers
              will provide a permanent report for those seeking to improve doctoral program
              initiatives in mathematics education.
