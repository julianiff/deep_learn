This project based at Arizona State University (ASU) will
              develop an interactive educational software system that uses real-time 3D
              computer graphics and auditory feedback to simulate materials analysis with
              energetic beam (photons or charged particles).  The focus will be on atom
              excitation and de-excitation processes leading to x-ray emission; the software
              will be used to help students understand the atomic level processes behind
              analytical techniques such as x-ray fluorescence and electron microprobe
              analysis.  The system will also include a digital movie illustrating atomic
              x-ray emission processes that will be distributed over the Internet.

The
              visualization and interactivity of the multimedia project will assist students
              in understanding radiation-matter interactions.  The project fits in the
              integrated vision of remote-controlled analysis that ASU is trying to
              realize.
