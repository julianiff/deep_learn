Abstract    :
              This project seeks to develop a participatory technology assessment methodology
              that-incorporates systematic attention to technologies' effects on democracy.-
              Recent scholarly inquiry into issues involving democracy and technology has
              focused on the role-of technical experts in technological decisions, or on
              mechanisms for broadening-participation in such decisions.  There has been
              little effort to operationalize-the complementary need to ensure that
              democratic processes result in technologies that are-substantively
              democratic--i.e., that help, both individually and collectively, and directly
              and indirectly,-to perpetuate democratic values, procedures and institutions.-
              The principal investigator has developed a set of `contestable` democratic
              design criteria for technologies.  A `democratic politics of technology` would
              incorporate democratic processes for refining-such criteria and applying them
              comprehensively across a society's technological order.-However, this requires
              an institution or democratic-procedure that would make this complex task
              practicable.- `Scenario workshops`--a participatory technology assessment
              methodology developed-recently in Europe--harbor the potential to be modified
              for use in debating and refining-democratic design criteria and applying them
              to many technologies at once.  These workshops use-several competing scenario
              narratives--each describing the role of multiple technologies in
              structuring-future daily life--as the starting point for a participatory
              process.  Diverse groups of participants: (1)-constructively criticize each
              scenario; (2) use the refashioned scenarios as a starting point for-developing
              preferred future visions for their own community or society; (3) identify
              barriers (e.g.,-cultural, institutional, technical, economic, and legal) to
              realizing their preferred visions; and (4) craft-action plans for overcoming
              these barriers.- Working within the conceptual framework of applied normative
              democratic theory of-technology, this project will adapt and modify the
              scenario workshop process so that it includes the-debate, refinement, and use
              of democratic design criteria.  Democratic design criteria will be used
              to-evaluate previous scenario narratives and workshop discussions, and to
              modify scenarios so that they-encourage participants to attend to the
              implications of alternative technology decisions for democracy.-The project
              will also develop new scenarios and workshop exercises through which future
              participants-will be able to debate and refine the initial democratic criteria
              and use them in their own constructive-technology assessment processes.- The
              methodological innovations from this project may: (1) inspire-other scholars to
              pursue research into the socially important but profoundly neglected democratic
              implications of alternative technologies; (2) be ready for testing in practice
              in future participatory design-technology assessment, technology policymaking,
              and urban planning exercises; and (3) provide-one practical alternative to the
              economically-based methodologies--such as cost-risk-benefit analysis-and
              applied neoclassical welfare economics-that, despite numerous recognized
              limitations, today-dominate the discourse of technological decisions.-
