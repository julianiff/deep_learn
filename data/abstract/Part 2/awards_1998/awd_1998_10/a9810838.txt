Abstract    :
                This collaborative project investigates appointment politics and practices on
              the U.S. District Courts in the current historically lengthy (1969-2000) period
              of divided government.  This research extends the PIs prior work developing a
              linked dataset that spans the evolution of the courts from 1789.  The district
              courts are ideal loci for studies of divided versus unified control of
              government, neo-institutionalism, and social background theory among others. 
              Three types of data are included:  the legislative history behind the creation
              of each court and seat, information on the officeholders and the circumstance
              of their appointment and departure that will enable the investigators to track
              each position and the judges occupying it over time, and data on their
              backgrounds an career experiences. With this database, scholars will have
              access to a wide range of information on all judges from the founding of the
              Republic. The dataset is large enough (N nearly = 2,500 judges) to allow
              investigators to use statistical analysis of data meaningfully.      %%%  This
