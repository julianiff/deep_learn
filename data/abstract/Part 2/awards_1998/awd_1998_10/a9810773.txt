Abstract    :
              9810773  Diehl    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a  superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) and field-free room for  the
              paleomagnetics laboratory at Michigan Technological  University (MTU).  The SRM
              will replace their present spinner  magnetometer that is besieged with problems
              and cannot be used to  reliably measure weakly  magnetized samples.  The field
              free room  will optimize the performance of the SRM while eliminating the 
              acquisition of laboratory-induced viscous magnetization during  storage and
              transfer of the samples.  The addition of a SRM at  MTU will allow rapid
              analyses of weakly magnetized sediments as  well as more strongly magnetized
              igneous rocks.  Some of the  current projects that will benefit from the
              acquisition of the  SRM include: (1) studies of the magnetic properties of
              volcanic  ash as an aid in tephra correlation and as indicators of  atmospheric
              fractionation, (2) the reconstruction of upper  Pleistocene and Holocene
              paleoenvironments from cave sediments in  the Moravian Karst, Czech Republic
              and, (3) investigations into  the rates of movement along the Hilina Fault
              System on south  flank of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.  Future projects that will
              be  made possible with the acquisition of the SRM include the  following: (1)
              an investigation into the timing of the  unconformity that separates Permian
              rocks from Triassic rocks in  southwestern Utah, (2) investigations into
              regional climate  changes since the last glaciation derived from magnetic 
              properties of lake cores from the Keweenaw Peninsula, and (3)  historical
              studies of the Keweenaw current based on secular  variation and correlation of
              Lake Superior sediments.  ***
