              University of Cincinnati                                                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                         This
              grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element
              of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Joel Fried
              at the University of Cincinnati. The research is a fundamental study of the
              transport of gas molecules through polyphosphazene type membranes. These
              materials comprise a        relatively new and extremely interesting class of
              inorganic polymers.  Their chemical stability make them excellent candidates
              for a various applications, and their properties can be highly tuned through   
                  modifying substituent groups. The focus of the research is the correlation
              between the chemical structure of specific polyphosphazenes and the
              characteristics of gas transport . Of particular interest is the focus on O2
              transport in these materials which have been experimentally found to have an
              extremely high permeability to O2. The research involves a computer simulation
              approach to model gas transport to seek to correlate the polymer free volume
              with the size, shape and electronic structure of the diffusing species.  The
              research is expected to have an impact on the knowledge base of gas transport
              through membrane systems, and will allow better  design of membranes based on
              polyphosphazenes.
