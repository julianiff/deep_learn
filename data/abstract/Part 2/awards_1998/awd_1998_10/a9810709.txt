This award
              supports the planning and development of a comprehensive blueprint for
              expanding the current research activities and curriculum of Texas A&M
              University - Corpus Christi.  This blueprint will enable the department to
              recruit more students, particularly minority students, into both undergraduate
              and graduate programs, retain more undergraduates, and increase the research
              capacity.  As part of this process, the PIs expect to develop cooperative
              agreements with other regional universities to pipeline their master's students
              into other Ph.D. programs.  Activities include:  identifying areas of applied
              research which can have a significant impact (e.g., GIS applications,
              mathematical modeling and simulation, and fundamental enabling technologies for
              interactive systems including HCI, distributed systems, hypermedia and
              development environments); identifying equipment needed to support an expanded
              research program; traveling to other universities to discuss the Ph.D. pipeline
              community; developing a plan for disseminating the results for project;
              pursuing other sources for acquiring research equipment; and identifying
              linkages between courses and additional research activities.
