Abstract    :
              This empirical research will add to our understanding of the relationship
              between-science, environmental policy, and public participation.  Using a
              meso-level approach in the context of marine fisheries management, the
              investigators examine how science, and claims about scientific-credibility, are
              used within large, but still defined, communities of stakeholders.-- Many
              federal fisheries management-plans exist and informative comparisons among them
              can be made. The research will tap in to an ongoing-debate about what
              constitutes good fisheries data and how such data should be used, and builds
              upon-previous research on stakeholder participation in marine fisheries
              management decisions.-- It uses key informant interviews, a telephone survey,
              case studies, and document analysis, to examine (1) how the level of overall
              scientific certainty about an issue affects participant claims about scientific
              credibility, (2) what patterns can be discerned in how participants gather and
              use scientific information, and (3) how legal mandates about scientific issues
              affect the use of scientific data and claims about credibility.  Key informant
              interviews will include fisheries-scientists and other participants in
              fisheries management, scientists and other personnel-working for federally
              mandated regional councils and commissions and state-level agencies, and
              fishers from the-commercial and recreational sectors.  Respondents will be
              asked about their use of scientific information-and their opinions about how
              such information should be used. In interviews of scientists, investigators
              will ask about-how specific legal mandates affect the way they use data and
              make scientific decisions.--The telephone survey of a random selection of
              participants in public meetings and hearings will test-hypotheses, generated
              from the key informant interviews, about how institutional and
              professional-affiliations, and class and sectoral interests, affect perceptions
              of how science should be used. The case studies of the management of lobster,
              bluefish, and summer flounder will involve three-major methods: 1) participant
              observation of fisheries management-procedures; 2) in-depth interviews with
              participants from different agencies and stakeholder groups;-and 3) archival
              research on documents from fisheries management agencies and other
              sources.--The final project component studies a sample of federal fisheries
              management plans to make both qualitative and-quantitative comparisons of 75
              species under effort-based-management from around the United States. Using
              publicly available documents, the investigators will assess both the-certainty
              of the science on which the plan is built and the type of challenges to that
              science that have been-made in public fora, to test the hypothesis that more
              certain science leads to fewer public challenges-to that science.-
