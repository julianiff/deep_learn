Abstract    :
              Abstract  9810414  Ebert    Understanding why natural landscapes look as they do
              requires understanding how vegetation responds to unusual events.  In the
              desert of southern California, rain typically is confined to winter months;
              occasionally, however, unusual late summer storms sweep up from the south.
              During the past 25 years there have been two of these unusual summer events: 
              Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 and Hurricane Nora in 1997.  In response to these
              events, seeds germinated for species that usually do not have new additions to
              their populations.    Germination of seeds is just the first step in adding new
              plants to a population; they also must survive.  The winter following Hurricane
              Kathleen was relative dry and seedling mortality was high.  The winter of
              1997-98 is during an El Nino and is proving to be much wetter.  Seed
              germination following an unusual summer hurricane followed by high winter rains
              associated with an El Nino may prove to be the most important event of this
              century for many plant species in the desert.  Our study of seedling growth and
              survival will help to understand the importance of rare events in ecosystems.
