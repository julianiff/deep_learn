Marine chemists have known for several decades that there is a
              ubiquitous thin film of living and non-living material on the sea surface.  
              Past research has established that chemical concentrations, especially
              concentrations of organic substances, in this film are several orders of
              magnitude higher than in bulk seawater.  This project will move beyond simply
              measuring the classes and identities of compounds in the microlayer into
              studies of the chemical reactions responsible for interconversion, production,
              and decomposition of those compounds.  Efforts will conctentrate on conversions
              of enzymatically-labile carbon and nitrogen moieties constituting the bulk of
              the microlayer organics. The investigators will thus provide pioneering insight
              into the behavior of the microlayer as a geochemical system.
