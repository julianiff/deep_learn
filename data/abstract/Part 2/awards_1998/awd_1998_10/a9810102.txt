Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9810102    Principal Investigator: Y. Fainman (University
              of California San Diego)     Title: 3-D Quantitative imaging and Correlation by
              Spatially Incoherent Chromatic Interferometry    Abstract      The proposal is
              to study the use of  newly developed diffractive optical components to perform
              3-dimensional profiling optically and quickly for application in reconfigurable
              manufacturing system. The proposed research will have significant impact on the
              next generation manufacturing technologies as it will allow integration of
              on-line parts inspection in real time into manufacturing systems.
