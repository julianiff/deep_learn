Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
              Division of Chemistry provides partial support for travel and participation
              costs for graduate students, post doctoral research associates, and young
              faculty to attend the Twelfth International Workshop on Ion-Surface Collisions,
              South Padre Island, January 24-29, 1999.  Topics to be covered at this meeting
              revolve around the fundamental interactions of ion beams with surfaces.  An
              objective of this Workshop is to expose chemists and physicists from this
              country to important topics in this area that has been dominated by European
              and Japanese scientists.

This Workshop on Ion-Surface Collisions will focus
              on fundamental interactions of ion beams with surfaces and include a diverse
              participant cohort from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering
              disciplines.  A focus of this Workshop will be to bolster this important area
              in this country to improve the position of this country relative to the more
              active programs found in Europe and Japan.  Young scientists and students will
              be supported to attend this Workshop through this project.
