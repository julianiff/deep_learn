Description: This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by a US team headed by Dr. M.Y. Shahin of The US Army Corps of
              Engineers, Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, in Champaign,
              Illinois and Dr. Mgady Abdelrahman, Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at
              Zagazig University, in Zagazig, Egypt.  The project's objective is to develop
              superior methods of pavement management in both countries.  They plan to
              exchange information on a recently developed pavement management software
              called MicroPaver software which was developed by the US Army Corps of
              Engineers, and is recognized as a valuable tool in effective pavement
              management and maintenance.  Two workshops are planned in Egypt, the first will
              concentrate on pavement management for roadways, and the second will
              concentrate on pavement management techniques for airfields.   

Scope:  This
              award is for collaboration between two scientists one in the US and one in
              Egypt, to develop the use of an advanced software program for the management
              and maintenance of pavement in highways and in airports in Egypt, and possibly
              later on in other developing countries.  This development is beneficial to
              Egypt as it embarks on a process of economic and demographic expansion which is
              quite dependent on the availability of good roads and airports.  It is also
              beneficial to the United States since the results will provide test data in
              physical environments similar to parts of this country, but under social and
              economic conditions that are similar to many of the countries in which US
              private construction companies operate.  This proposal meets the INT objective
              of enhancing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This
              project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which
              provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out
              these cooperative activities.
