Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the general hypothesis that political values
              and conceptions of expertise are systematically related with the constructions
              of citizenship found in the designs of public policies for controlling
              automotive air pollution.  A two-by-three conceptual matrix, drawn from the
              researchers previous work in historical political theory, will provide
              intermediate hypotheses indicating how different conceptions of politics and
              expertise might combine to form different constructions of citizenship.  This
              matrix will guide the collection and analysis of the primary data.  The data
              will be drawn from two carefully bounded areas in California automotive air
              pollution policy: the development of Inspection and Maintenance programs during
              the years 1978-1997 and the development of a program for promoting electric
              vehicles during the years 1990-96.  The proposed project draws on, and
              addresses shortcomings in, three academic subfields: policy studies, political
              theory, and the sociology of scientific knowledge.
