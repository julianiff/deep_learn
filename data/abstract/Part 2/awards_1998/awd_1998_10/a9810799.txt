              Title: An Iteratively Coupled Modeling Approach to Investigating  the "Equable
              Climate Problem"    Equable climates appear to have been common throughout
              Earth  history and yet are without well established cause.  This award 
              supports a study designed to explore ocean-atmosphere links in warm  climates
              states, and to bridge the gap between stand-alone and  interactively coupled
              models.  Stand-alone atmospheric and ocean  models will be coupled iteratively
              in a study which investigates  causes of equable climates.  Model results will
              be tested with  proxy marine and terrestrial paleoclimate data, to evaluate the
               modeling approach.  A hierarchy of three dimensional dynamical  models of the
              ocean-atmosphere system will be useed to explore  changes in oceanic meridional
              heat transport and the general  circulation, as functions of atmospheric pCO2
              and meridional sea  surface temperature (SST) gradients.  This study will
              provide  explicit, quantitative mechanisms of ocean-atmosphere poleward heat 
              transport, as well as more completely define the dynamics of warm  climate
              intervals.  In addition, the iterative modeling procedure  will help to
              determine how best to approach climate modeling for  times significantly
              different from present day.
