The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral
              research visit by Dr. David A. Boughton to work with Dr. Ilkka Hanski at the
              University of Helsinki in Finland.
Dr. Boughton will study two species of
              butterflies, one population in California, near Sequoia National Park, the
              other in Finland, located in the Aland Islands.  He will look at how behavioral
              preferences and landscape structure interact to produce patterns of dispersal. 
              After testing predicted colonization dynamics against observed patterns, Dr.
              Boughton will develop a more general, practical model, using computer
              simulations to show the general parameters that govern this interaction.
Dr.
              Hanski has expertise in empirical testing and his group in Finland has built a
              unique dataset on metapopulation dynamics, which will allow the evaluation of
              Dr. Boughton's hypotheses about dispersal.
