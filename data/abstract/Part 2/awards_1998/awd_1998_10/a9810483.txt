Abstract    :
              With this New award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is  
              supporting the work of Dr. Joseph T. Hupp of Northwestern University.     The
              goal of this work is to develop new nanoporous chemical sensors from  
              inorganic materials with designable and controllable chemical recognition  
              properties.   These novel materials are constructed with rectangular   tubules
              using rhenium tricarbonyl chloride for corner links, and a   variety of organic
              diamines (for example 4,4'-dipyridyl) of varying sizes   as the side members.  
              Chemical sensing and quantitation are provided by   luminescence and
              microgravimetric (SAW or quartz crystal microgravimetry)   measurements.  Dr.
              Hupp is developing a new class of chemical sensors, based on   molecular
              structures with controllable pore size, that could be used to   sense and
              measure the concentrations of toxic pollutants in air and water
