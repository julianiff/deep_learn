Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102 (replaces NSF 96-64). 
              It provides for partial support for a DS-3 connection to the very high
              performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) for Mississippi Sate University. 
              Among the applications are computational field simulation, experimentation in
              wide-area parallel computing, collaborative visualization involving
              transmission of large datasets, and distance learning.
