Abstract    :
              9810179  Feldstein  For many years, the National Bureau of Economic Research has
              organized a semi-annual Universities' Research Conference (URC) in Cambridge.
              The URC brings together economists from across the country for two days of
              discussions on a particular topic. These conferences have been very successful
              in opening the lines of communication and establishing working relationships
              between economists who work within a particular field but are located at
              universities across the country. Continued support of the URC by the National
              Science Foundation would help to ensure that this valuable forum will continue.
               Conference topics are chosen for their relevance to current economic policy
              discussions as well as their interest to academic economists. Recent
              conferences have focused on the effects of large government budget deficits on
              exchange rates and international capital flows, the role of firms in labor
              markets, taxation and financial behavior.  Papers for presentation at the
              conferences are solicited from over 125 economics departments and business
              schools. Conference organizers select a mix of established and less well known
              researchers. Discussants and other conference participants are also chosen to
              encourage interaction among researchers with similar interests at different
              universities. A typical conference includes 7 to 10 papers and about 80
              participants from over 40 different universities.
