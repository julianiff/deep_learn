Abstract    :
              9810470  Brown    The PI proposes to join an international team of investigators
              to  do paleomagnetic field work in Patagonia, Argentina.  The PI will  collect
              samples for a detailed paleosecular variation data set  from late Cenozoic
              volcanic fields which will provide information  on long-term variation in 
              Earth's magnetic field.  By joining an established field program,  the research
              can be accomplished with large savings in  infrastructure costs.  The
              co-location of paleomagnetic with other  measurements, including geochronogy,
              will be beneficial to both  research programs.  The research  wil provide the
              first paleosecular variation observations from  southern Sourth America and
              will fill an important void in the  global data coverage.  ***
