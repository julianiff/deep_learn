Abstract    :
              In this project researchers at the University of Miami collaborate
with
              researchers at the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores
de Monterrey
              to analytically and experimentally  evaluate the
performance of proposed
              control (admission control and policing) and
scheduling (priority-based and
              general processor sharing ) algorithms in an
ATM environment of
              video-on-demand and voice applications. The work 
combines new theoretical
              research on traffic characterization, control
and scheduling using
              conventional  and computational intelligence
techniques (fuzzy logic and
              neuro-fuzzy based schemes), as well as
experimental evaluation and comparison
              of
already proposed techniques with the newly proposed ones.
Experimental
              networks will be set-up at both sites for evaluation of the
proposed
              algorithms.  (URL: http://www.ece.miami.edu/christos/nsf_conacyt)
