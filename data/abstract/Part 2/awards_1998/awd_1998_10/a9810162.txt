The objective of this research is to develop robust control
              algorithms for ventricular assist devices.  The principal investigator proposed
              a series of objectives which will result in the design and validation of a
              controller which will subsequently be evaluated in animal experiments.  The
              proposed control system will have three modes, along with a supervisory process
              to determine the appropriate mode of operation.  These modes include a default,
              nonadaptive mode which will be used in the event of failure of the control
              system; a device dependent mode which only utilizes parameters of the assist
              device; and a patient adaptive mode, in which a model of the cardiovascular
              system will be used in conjunction with Kalman estimators to control the assist
              device operation.  A bi-ventricular mock circulatory system is proposed for
              evaluation and validation of the control strategies.
