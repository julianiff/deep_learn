Abstract    :
              The investigator is conducting systematic radar measurements of portions of the
              upper atmosphere.  He intends to ascertain whether 'small ice comets,' whose
              existence was reported by Lou Frank, do, in fact, impact the upper atmosphere. 
              These ice comets reportedly enter the upper atmosphere at a rapid rate, and
              their size is purportedly large.  Mathews' radar measurements will prove or
              disprove Franks' theory.
