Abstract    :
                       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to
              demonstrate the feasibility of a method for detecting individual E. coli
              bacteria (to simulate a foodborne or waterborne pathogen) with a breadboard
              system. The innovative technique proposed for detecting pathogenic
              microorganisms in food or water has critical advantages over alternatives. It
              is:  (1) capable of detecting single microorganisms (current techniques need
              over 104 microorganisms);  (2) capable of completely examining a large volume
              of food or water in real time; (3) inherently automatic; (4) sensitive only to
              selected bacteria or viruses; and (5) capable of using multi-probe,
              multi-wavelength redundancy to eliminate false positive detections even in
              complex media.  This technique is based on laser induced fluorescence in which
              a stream of solution containing the microorganisms is labeled with fluorescent
              probes and then is illuminated with a laser diode (commonly called flow
              cytometry).  The resulting fluorescence is detected with a CCD imager using a
              novel integration scheme.  The proposed device will use fiber optics and a
              laser diode to provide a low-cost, rugged package. Phase I will also determine
              the optimum performance parameters for the prototype to be built In Phase II.

                       The most profitable applications of this technique are the detection
              of infectious microorganisms in contaminated food and water.  Foodborne
              microbial pathogens account for approximately 7 million illnesses and 9,000
              deaths in the U.S. annually, with an estimated economic loss of at least $6
              billion.
