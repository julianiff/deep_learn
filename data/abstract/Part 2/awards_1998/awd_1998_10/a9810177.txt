              Abstract  ATM-9810177  Anderson, Patricia M.  University of Washington  Title:
              Late Quaternary Climate of Northeast Asia: Temporal and  Spatial Variability   
              This award supports a project designed to improve the understanding  of late
              Quaternary climatic systems of East Asia by documenting  spatial and temporal
              variations in climates of the last 18,000  radiocarbon years for NE Asia,
              describing probable millennial and  centennial scale mechanisms that can
              account for the observed  paleoclimatic changes, and comparing results from NE
              Asia to other  regions (e.g., SE Asia, NW North America, North Atlantic) to
              obtain  a more holistic view of the inter-relationships of regional  climatic
              systems.  Overall research goals will be accomplished by:  1) reconstructing
              past climates through the collection and analysis  of modern and ancient
              botanical, geochemical, and diatom data  preserved in lake sediments; 2)
              developing high quality  chronologies using improved radiocarbon techniques; 3)
              examining  modern synoptic climatic patterns, general circulation model 
              simulations, and conceptual frameworks to identify possible causes  of climatic
              change; 4) comparing the proxy- and model-based  paleoclimatic interpretations
              to assess the most likely mechanisms  behind the observed climatic histories;
              and 5) exploring possible  hemispheric scale linkages associated with
              Milankovitch and sub-  Milankovitch scale event.
