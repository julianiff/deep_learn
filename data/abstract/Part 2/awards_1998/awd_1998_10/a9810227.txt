Abstract    :
                9810227  TUMMALA    This award to the Packaging Research Center at the Georgia
              Institute of Technology will develop a practice-oriented masters degree program
              for students planning on working in the electronic packaging industry.  In
              addition, the proposers will develop a related certificate program for students
              interested in a shorter program focused on electronic packaging.  At present,
              the field of packaging has no formal degree programs, but many companies around
              the world are involved in it.  The masters degree program will have three
              components:  (1) engineering component; (2) management component; and (3)
              international affairs components.  Graduates of the masters degree and
              certificate programs will be prepared for work in industry in the field of
              electronic packaging, regardless of whether the graduate is located in the US
              or abroad.  This award builds on previous activities of the Center, notably the
              Global Innovation for Engineers program, which piloted the core concepts in the
              certificate and masters programs.  Representatives of corporate members of the
              Center will serve as advisors as the programs are developed, ensuring that the
              knowledge, skills, ad capabilities acquired by students are those needed by
              engineers in the packaging industry, regardless of the country in which they
              are assigned.
