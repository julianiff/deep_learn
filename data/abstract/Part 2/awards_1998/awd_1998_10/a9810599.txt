Abstract    :
              Pratt  9810599    This project is for theoretical, numerical, and laboratory 
              studies of  deep overflow and associated circulation.  In  particular, it is
              proposed to examine the circulation in the  upstream basin, and the hydraulic
              jumps that form downstream  of the sills.   A newly developed numerical model
              will be  used to simulate hydraulic jumps, and the proposed study  would unify
              disconnected earlier results.
