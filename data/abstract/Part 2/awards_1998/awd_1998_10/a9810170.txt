Abstract    :
              This is a study of the social organization and dynamics of multi-institutional
              collaborations in the physical sciences.  Included among such collaborations
              are studies in high-energy physics, ground-based astronomy, materials science,
              medical physics, and computer-centered collaborations.  For nearly ten years
              the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics has
              collected interviews and archival materials for such collaborations.  In the
              present project an interdisciplinary team will use the 580 interviews and
              thousands of pages of documents that describe these 56 large-scale
              collaborations to produce a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the
              characteristics, dynamics and performance of multi-institutional
              collaborations.  Cluster analysis will be used to develop a typology of the
              forms of collaboration by their most important organizational and technological
              dimensions, and qualitative comparative analysis will be used to examine their
              relationships with important outcomes such as success, trust and conflict. 
              Results will be reported in a book intended for scholars, policy makers and
              archivists.
