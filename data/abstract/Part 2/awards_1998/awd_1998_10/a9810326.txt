Abstract    :
                      9810326  Borski  The investigator addresses novel mechanisms by which a
              steroid, cortisol, rapidly inhibits prolactin secretion in fish.  Steroid
              hormones typically act on target tissues by altering DNA, a genomic process
              requiring hours or days to occur.  Dr. Borski shows cortisol acts within
              minutes to inhibit prolactin release.   He postulates that cortisol may also
              act through nongenomic, membrane receptor-associated pathways typically
              described for rapidly acting neurotransmitter and peptide hormones.  Dr. Borski
               will test this hypothesis and define biochemical pathways by which cortisol
              and other steroids rapidly alter cell function.  In many fish, prolactin is
              critical to survival in fresh water, while cortisol is central to seawater
              osmoregulation.  Rapid attenuation of a freshwater hormone, prolactin, and
              stimulation of seawater adaptation by cortisol is likely essential for allowing
              fish to survive rapid increases in salinity.  Conversely, stress-induced
              elevations in cortisol could prove maladaptive for animals living in fresh
              water conditions which cause high mortality of commercially valuable finfish
              due to handling and live transport.  Completion of this work will advance
              understanding of the detailed workings underlying osmoregulation,  an ancient
              and universal process critical to physiological adaptation as well as provide
              an integrative model for "stress hormone" effects that impair physiological
              processes including reproduction, behavior, and immune function.
