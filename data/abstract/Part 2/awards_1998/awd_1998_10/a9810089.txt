Abstract    :
              9810089  Ague    This grant provides partial support for upgrading 
              instrumentation and computers required for  operation of the X-ray
              diffractometer (XRD) and  electron microprobe (EMP) laboratories in the 
              Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale  University.  Specific upgrades
              include: (1) Replace  obsolete XRD computer and software with modern PC-  based
              system. (2) Upgrade the energy-dispersive  detector on the EMP in order to
              improve peak  resolution and enable detection of light elements  (B, C, N, O,
              F). (3) Replace obsolete computer and  software on EMP used for image 
              acquisition/processing, X-ray mapping, and energy-  dispersive spectrum
              acquisition and processing with  modern PC-based system. (4) Replace obsolete
              carbon  coater in EMP laboratory.    The XRD and EMP are invaluable
              Departmental  workhorses for faculty, students, post-docs,  research
              affiliates, and visiting scholars involved  in a broad spectrum of research,
              including:  (1) Field-based metamorphic and igneous petrology,  (2)
              Experimental petrology/geochemistry, (3)  Geochemistry of sedimentary and
              weathering  processes, (4) Economic geology, (5) Structural  geology and
              tectonics, (6) paleontology, (7)  Archaeometallurgy, and (8) Biomineralization.
