                  This project is a continuation of the GFD (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics)
              Program.  The GFD program is a ten-week session in interdisciplinary research
              and graduate training held at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
              since 1959.  The GFD program promotes an exchange of ideas among the many
              distinct fields that share a common interest in the nonlinear dynamics of
              rotating, stratified fluids.  At the same time, the program also introduces
              young physical scientists to the special rewards of cross-disciplinary
              knowledge and research.  Topics for the five years are:  "Physics of the Upper
              Ocean", The General Circulation of the Atmosphere", "Climate Dynamics", "Mixing
              and Transport in Turbulent Flows", and "Non-Newtonian GFD".
