Abstract    :
              9810649  Wong    This project is for an observational and numerical study of 
              the wind-induced exchange between an estuary and adjacent  continental shelf.  
              The scientific objectives are to:  1)  determine the spatial structure of
              wind-induced current;  and 2) examine the importance of remote and local wind
              on  the sub-tidal exchange process.  The field program consists  of moored and
              shipboard observations, and the numerical  simulations will be used to
              interpret observations and to  generalize observational findings to other
              estuaries.
