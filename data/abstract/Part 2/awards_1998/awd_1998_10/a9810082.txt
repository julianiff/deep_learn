Abstract    :
              Abstract   ANIR-9810082  PI:  Delmar Johnson  South Dakota State University 
              Brookings, South Dakota      This proposal requests funding for the
              installation of a T1 line and related operating costs to connect the West River
              Nursing Center (WRNC) to statewide network resources and the Internet.  The
              WRNC, SDSU College of Nursing, is one of only two such institutions in the
              state that provides a B.S. or M.S. degree in nursing education .  It is located
              in the Black Hills area of South Dakota at the western edge of the state.
              Access to the Internet would allow faculty, staff and students to utilize
              remote library resources, collaborate with peers, and continue their research
              and professional development.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
