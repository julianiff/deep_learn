A complete experimental characterization is developed
              for the mechanisms involved in the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of alloys
              600 and 690 used for pressurized water reactors and specially in steam
              generator tubing. The active mechanisms for integranular SCC suceptibility of
              these alloys are identified. Such findings disclose the mechanistic aspects
              associated with crack propagation during intrergranular SCC in milled annealed
              alloys 600 and 690. It is assessed whether cavities or micro-fisures are
              generated at the root of the crack tip due to methane bubble evolution. This
              information is vital for the safe operation of nuclear power plants.***
