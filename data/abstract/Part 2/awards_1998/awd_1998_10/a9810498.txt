Title:
              Interannual Variations in the Stratosphere and their Relationship of Solar
              Activity

The proposed work will build on new findings that provide direct
              evidence of the solar cycle in records of stratospheric temperature and motion.
              The investigation will use NCEP reanalyzes to develop a 
global description of
              decadal changes  in the stratosphere up to 10 mb. Contemporaneous variations of
              chemical structure will also be investigated in records of ozone from the
              ozonezonde and Umkehr 
networks. The work is important because it will shed 
              insight on  the interaction of the solar cycle with stratospheric variability
              leading to better understanding of the dynamical and chemical structure of the
              
stratosphere.
