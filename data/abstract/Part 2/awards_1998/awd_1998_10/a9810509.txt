Abstract

	This award will be used to purchase a microplate
              UV/visible spectrophotometer and a microplate fluorometer to improve the
              research and training quality and increase lab and environmental safety at
              Bethune-Cookman College.  Using these instruments for non-radioactive
              colorimetric experiments (visible spectrophotometry) such as commercially
              available ELISA and non-radioactive UV spectrophotometry and fluorescence
              photometry in 96-ample well format will greatly reduce the use of chemicals and
              replace conventional radioactive methods.  Therefore, the acquisition of these
              instruments will make the lab experiments much safer by minimizing
              environmental pollution and preventing radiation hazards.  The microplate
              spectrophotometer and microplate fluorometer can simultaneously read up to 96
              samples to replace an outdated one-cuvet spectrophotometer, thereby greatly
              facilitating experiments not only in research laboratories but also in biology,
              chemistry and physics teaching laboratories.  At least two of the chemistry,
              two of the biology faculty and one of the physics faculty will use these
              instruments.  In addition, three research students currently funded by Minority
              Biomedical Research Support and 1 or 2 students from other funded programs will
              use these instruments.  Approximately 25 chemistry majors, 75 biology majors
              and 8 physics majors will be trained in the practical applications of these
              instruments.
