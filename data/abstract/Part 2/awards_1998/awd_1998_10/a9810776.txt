Abstract    :
                This dissertation project examines the relation between colonial social
              knowledge production, the ethnographic enterprise undertaken by
              late-nineteenth-century demographers, surveyors, and frontier administrators
              and the emergence of legal pluralism.  Of specific focus is the overlap among
              customary, Islamic, and European civil codes that explain politically salient
              self-perceptions of individuals in court.  The research uses historical
              analyses to address three questions.  How did colonial social knowledge
              producers formulate there ideas about indigenous customary and Islamic laws,
              how did these laws inform administrative strategies, and how did these
              strategies affect patterns of individual identity formation?  The research is
              being carried out in Pakistan primarily with comparative data being collected
              in Southeast Asia.  The outcome of this work will advance our understanding of
              the development and expression of legal pluralism in contemporary societies.
