Abstract    :
              The PIs will develop a 3-D model of the fluid and thermal flow along strike in
              the Barbados Accretionary Complex considering both thermal and geochemical
              transport.  The modeling effort will be directed at understanding of the
              interrelationships between tectonic and gravitational stress, fluid flow and
              thermal and geochemical transport in actively deforming sediments.  The
              application of 3-D modeling in this and other complexes will assist in the
              planning of future drilling and seafloor observtory projects and in development
              of global fluid, heat and geochemical budgets.
