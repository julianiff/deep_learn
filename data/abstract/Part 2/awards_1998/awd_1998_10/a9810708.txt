Minority Institutions Infrastructure:  Establishment of Research
              Career Integration Program:  A Minority Institutions Infrastructure Request
              

Utilizing RCIPro, a Research Career Integration Program, CSUSB will
              establish an infrastructure to support the development of a competitive
              integrated research and student training program in computer science that will
              service its large under-represented student population, implementing pre- and
              post-baccalaureate pipelines, with coordination agreements both with feeder and
              PhD institutions.  Student mentors will be employed for the outreach, faculty
              mentors for the fundamental research areas.  Hot-topic research
              components-networking, software engineering, and bio-informatics, GIS will
              serve as research focus.  Faculty, student investigators, and vendor partners
              will provide cross-fertilization and intellectual unity.   For a long-term
              impact, the research activities are being organized under thrusts involving
              distributed high performance concurrent computing, intelligent agents,
              visulization, high throughout networks, data stores, and software engineering. 
               Each research focus will utilize examples already under development at CSUSB,
              which research groups will expand and evaluate within given constraints. 
              Through this effort, California State University at San Bernardino is expected
              to develop futher its computing science research capabilities involving
              minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual increase in
              underrepresented degrees in the pipeline.  It is hoped that through these
              efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a
              better racially and ethnically balanced technology enterprise for the benefit
              of its present and future generations.
