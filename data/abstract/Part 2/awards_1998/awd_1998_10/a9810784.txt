Abstract    :
              Abstract - Fridman        This is an award under the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research activity.  It is a study of the fundamental physics and
              chemistry of transition types of arc discharges, sometimes called sliding arcs,
              gliding arcs, or glidarcs, concentrating on the transition between equilibrium
              and nonequilibrium conditions in the arc.  In the study, the transition zone is
              defined in space and time, the plasma properties at the beginning of the
              transition are determined as well as those of the newly formed nonequilibrium
              plasma.  These properties include the discharge geometry, parameters of the
              electrical circuit and local parameters such as plasma temperatures and
              electric field values.  These studies are used to evaluate hypotheses on the
              mechanisms of ionization and the equilibrium-nonequilibrium transition.  The
              study includes high-speed video imaging synchronized with electrical
              measurements of current and voltage waveforms.    Gliding arc technology is
              thought to have great potential in environmental control and materials
              processing, and a great deal of applied research is underway.  However, the
              fundamental physics and chemistry of this recently discovered phenomenon has
              not been studied systematically.
