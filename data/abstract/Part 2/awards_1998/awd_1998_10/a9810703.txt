The objective of  this proposal
              is to study the diffusion and equilibrium concentration of different molecular
              weight polymer chains near interfaces, particularly filler or reinforcing
              particulate interfaces, polymer blend interfaces, and free surfaces.  The
              diffusion experiments will emphasize times shorter than the reputation time,
              the range of greatest industrial importance.  A series of experiments are
              planned to study the kinetics of diffusion of polymers to surfaces and
              interfaces, and also to establish experimentally the conditions under which
              shorter or longer chains are attracted preferentially to such surfaces.  The
              basis will be the use of deuterated probe polymers of longer shorter molecular
              weights, to establish not only the diffusion rates towards the surfaces and
              interfaces involved, but also the equilibrium concentrations.  The polymers
              involved will be based on polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), with
              silica serving as one of the composite fillers.  Another series of experiments
              will involve blends of ionic and non-ionic polymers.  The ionic polymer portion
              will be deuterated.  By studying the effective molecular weights and radii of
              gyration of the chains, as well as their effective diffusion rates, the
              relationships between the size of the ionic groups and/or aggregation effects
              can be determined.  Yet another set of experiments will measure the direct
              chemical reaction between the ends of chains, important as an alternate to
              interdiffusion in latex film formation.
