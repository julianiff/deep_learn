Abstract    :
                  Abstract - Linjewile      This is an investigation of the influence of
              moisture and carbon monoxide on the plasma-induced destruction of nitrous oxide
              in a flue-gas stream.  It includes design and construction of a
              laboratory-scale pulsed corona reactor and the study of nitrous-oxide reaction
              kinetics using a simulated flue gas.  Effluent gases are analyzed online using
              a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a chemiluminescence NOx
              analyzer, and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system.  A
              mathematical analysis of nitrous oxide removal in the corona reactor is
              performed using a chemical kinetics model that follows important reaction steps
              and formation of undesirable byproducts.    Although fluidized-bed combustion
              of coal produces less overall oxides of nitrogen and sulfur than traditional
              pulverized-coal boilers, it yields high levels of nitrous oxide, a powerful
              greenhouse gas.   A control strategy is needed to make this technology
              environmentally acceptable.
