Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS 981 0662                    Douglas Hittle        The proposal is
              to partially support travel by American Experts to attend the 2nd International
              Conference on Energy and Environment in Shanghai, China.  The American
              attendees are experts in the areas of heating, ventilating, air conditioning,
              heat transfer, and combustion.  As noted in the proposal, developing nations
              are experiencing unprecedented increases in their energy consumption, often in
              ways that are wasteful or threatening t the environment.   Many of the most
              modern techniques currently used in America and Europe are unfamiliar to local
              practitioners.  This travel grant will assist the goals of the conference by
              sharing information available to the Americans among the other participants.
