Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS-9810548     Principle Investigator: Panton   
              This is a grant for a workshop on "Self-Sustaining Mechanisms of Wall
              Turbulence," A monograph on this topic was published in August, 1997.  This
              subject is a central issue in the field of turbulence and is important in
              bringing mathematical modeling methods in closer harmony with nature.  Fifteen
              author groups of international recognition were invited to present their ideas
              on this subject in articles in the monograph.  The purpose of this symposium is
              to get this group of experts together again to discuss and critically review
              their ideas and the ideas of others.  Since publication of the monograph, all
              parties have had an opportunity to review the ideas of others.  Also, since the
              initial articles have been written, several groups have made significant
              progress and have new developments to report.  In addition to the original
              authors, four experts in turbulence have been invited to critique the monograph
              contributions and add their own ideas. A report will be prepared in the form 
              of a review article.  The review article will be made public in written form as
              a paper at a future national meeting of a scientific society.  ***
