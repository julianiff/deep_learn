Abstract    :
              Pedlosky  9810606    The project will investigate theoretically, numerically and
               experimentally the problem of zonal flow in a suddenly  expanding channel on a
              beta-plane.  The goal is to  understand the relationship between the flow
              separation,  formation of a re-circulation gyre and the hydraulic effect  of
              Rossby waves.   The anticipated results can be used in a  broad range of
              related oceanographic problems where  separation is an important feature of the
              flow.
