Abstract    :
              The problem of marrying expert knowledge to authoritative political decision
              making is ancient but continually vexing.  A tradition of scholarship in
              describing and legitimating technical-advisory and assessment institutions has
              not significantly improved upon the conventional wisdom to-keep experts `on
              tap, not on top.`  However, the recent joining of a constructivist
              understanding of-science to traditional concerns of expertise has led to a
              provocative prescription for the pursuit of what-have been called `serviceable
              truths.`  These are truths that contain both scientific and political elements
              that allow parties to a dispute to achieve a workable concensus.  The proposed
              research: 1) identifies a set of strategies to-create serviceable truths; 2)
              seeks empirical examples of these strategies; 3) evaluates their use; and
              4)-elaborates and probes hypotheses about their use and impact.- The strategies
              derive from a critique of current-approaches and preliminary empirical work.-
              Cases are selected so as to include strategies deployed by decision makers in
              political institutions and those in technical institutions. They are further
              symmetric in that one case in each type of institution will include one-`pure`
              strategy, which subordinates concerns from outside the institution, and one
              `mixed` strategy, which-attempts to blend concerns relevant to both political
              and technical institutions.  Preliminary research has-identified one empirical
              case with each strategy and has evaluated the strategies as analytical
              constructs,-but not as empirical strategies.- The proposed research focuses on
              providing additional analytic support to these strategies,-consulting
              literature in political decision making, science studies, and elsewhere.  More
              importantly-it will conduct detailed empirical work, primarily elite
              interviews, in the cases already identified and, where-relevant, add additional
              cases.  It will further appraise the strategies critically in the context in
              which-decision makers deployed them, in an effort to evaluate whether their
              success in context comports with predictions about their adequacy, value,
              effectiveness and legitimacy.- This research will not only extend a tradition
              of scholarship about the making of technically-complex political decisions by
              elaborating the concept of the `serviceable truths` into a set of
              decision-making strategies but, through an explicit dissemination plan, it will
              also provide helpful guidance to-decision makers in both political and
              technical institutions who seek to resolve problems at the-boundaries of
              politics and science.-
