     This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              project aims to develop a optical fiber detection system using multiplexed
              affinity-interferometric (Al) sensors for in-situ monitoring of microorganisms
              present in aqueous samples such as potable or pharmaceutical process grade
              water, milk derivatives or fruit juice. Simplified, on-line detection in real
              time for food or pharmaceutical processing is a desirable but currently limited
              monitoring technology.  The system will be cost effective, robust,
              operationally simple, and amenable to automation including a microfluidic or
              other sampling system interface. The proposers will design and fabricate a
              sensor composed of multiplexed optical fiber sensors to detect target molecules
              characteristic of the presence of microorganism.  These molecules can be
              proteinacious, DNA, or lipophilic components of lysed (or secreted components
              of living) procaryotic cells or protozoa.  Phase I of this proposal will focus
              upon the simple detection of one proteinacious, one DNA, and one lipophilic
              target which together demonstrate the potential of multiple microorganism
              detection by an advanced, multiplexed, sensor system. A complete system
              integration for demonstration of a practical field monitoring application for
              up to eight different microbial targets in processing streams from milk-derived
              pharmaceuticals is slated for Phase II.
     The proposed optical fiber
              biochemical sensors will find widespread application in large annual markets in
              the food processing, environmental remediation, pharmaceutical fields.
