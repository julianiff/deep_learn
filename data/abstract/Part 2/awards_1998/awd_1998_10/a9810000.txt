Abstract    :
              Biomolecular molecular computation (BMC) uses biochemical methods  to do
              computation at the molecular level. The goal of this  research is to determine
              key required capabilities of a  distributed operating system (BMC-OS) for BMC,
              including:  (i) distributed flow of control,(ii) distributed message 
              transmission and message handling, (iii) distribution and  retrieval of data
              and files,(iv) locality optimizations, (v)  data  integrity assurance,
              an(vi)distributed I/O. The effort is focusing  on a few key topics which have
              the most impact on the design of a  BMC-OS :(a) Integrity Assurance, Decreased
              I/O and Error  Resiliency--a combination of computer science and biochemical 
              techniques are being used to do data fingerprinting and a very  high fan-out
              data distribution method (using redundant coding)  will be used to increase
              data error resiliency. (b) Models and  Simulation Software for
              BMC-OS--Parameterized performance models  are used to reflect the geometric and
              other constraints (e.g.,  solution and reagent concentration, spatial
              distribution of DNA  strands, temperature, salinity, etc.) on the BMC-OS
              control,  including the application of MEMs technology to automate BMC.
