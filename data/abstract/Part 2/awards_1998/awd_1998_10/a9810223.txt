Abstract    :
                Harmful algal blooms, commonly called `red tides` or HABs,  are a serious
              economic and public health problem throughout  the world. In the U.S., the most
              serious HAB problem is  paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially
              fatal  neurological disorder caused by human ingestion of shellfish  that
              accumulate toxins as they feed on dinoflagellates of  the genus Alexandrium.
              These organisms cause human illness  and death due to PSP, repeated shellfish
              harvest  quarantines, and the mortality of fish and marine mammals.  This
              phenomenon, which affects thousands of miles of U.S.  coastline and numerous
              fisheries resources, has expanded  dramatically in the last two decades,
              especially in the Gulf  of Maine. The ECOHAB-GOM addresses several fundamental 
              issues regarding Alexandrium blooms in the Gulf of Maine: 1)  the source of the
              Alexandrium cells that appear in the fresh  water plumes in the western Maine
              coastal current (WMCC); 2)  Alexandrium cell distribution and dynamics in the
              eastern  Maine coastal current (EMCC); and 3) linkages among blooms  in the
              WMCC, the EMCC and on Georges Bank. Utilizing a  combination of numerical
              modeling, hydrographic, chemical,  and biological measurements, moored and
              drifting current  measurements, and satellite imagery, we will characterize 
              the structure, variability and autecology of the major  Alexandrium habitats in
              the Gulf of Maine.
