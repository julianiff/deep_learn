Abstract    :
              This award supports a cooperative research project between Lorenz Biegler,
              Department of Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, and David
              Glasser, School of Process and Materials Engineering, University of the
              Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.  The project is entitled "Attainable
              Regions and Mathematical programming for Waste Minimization in Chemical
              Processes."  Process modification to minimize the production of hazardaous and
              toxic byproducts has captured considerable industrial attention over the past
              decade. A promising strategy to waste minimization in chemical processes is to
              develop improved reactor designs and reactor networks that avoid the production
              of these byproducts in the first place. In this way, the downstream separation
              and cleanup costs are reduced or even eliminated.  To deal with this important
              problem, the collaborative research effort between Carnegie Mellon University
              (CMU) and the University of Witwatersrand (WITS) will develop process synthesis
              strategies that are centered on the reactor network itself.  During the past
              decade, the research group in South Africa has worked on geometric approaches
              to solving this problem while the US group has developed computational
              algorithms based on process optimization. This joint venture combines the best
              of both approaches and plans to develop superior strategies for reactor network
              design for waste minimizing chemical processes.
