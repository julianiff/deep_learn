Abstract    :
              Although producers in the same industry compete with one another in markets,
              they also commonly affiliate in associations. Producer's associations take a
              variety of forms, and serve a number of functions: They identify communities of
              producers as "industries," instate norms governing relations among competitors,
              and act as agents for dealing collectively with suppliers, distributors,
              competing industries, consumers, and regulators. As a community and as an
              agent, producer's associations thus play a role in the regulation of production
              and the larger political economy. This study examines the Salt Producer's
              Association and its successors, focusing on changes in the association's
              functions and on the ways in which the producers organize themselves through
              the association. These changes are hypothesized to be responses to dynamics of
              the industry's niche in the larger economy--a niche that affects the rational
              interests of firms and the solidarity of their community. Data will be drawn
              from two sources: (1) Aggregate statistics, histories, and documents for
              studying the organizational ecology of the industry, and (2) content analyses
              of the minutes of the meetings of the Salt Producer's Association for measuring
              how stake-holders use the association for internal regulation and external
              representation of the industry. The research will contribute to our
              understanding of the factors that shape the roles of producers associations,
              and how these roles change in response to factors within industries and the
              environments within which industries operate.
