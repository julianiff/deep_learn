Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the application of a scanning holography
              technique, a novel technique invented by the PI, to 3-D optical pattern
              recognition. If the proposed scheme becomes successful it would substantially
              advance the understanding and knowledge in the field of 3-D microscopy, medical
              imaging, pattern recognition and other related areas.
