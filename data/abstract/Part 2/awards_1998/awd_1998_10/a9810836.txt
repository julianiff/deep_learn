Abstract    :
                  9810836  Baldwin  National Technological University      ABSTRACT      This
              award provides funding for the support of the 1998 National Engineers Week
              Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  The ninth annual Discover
              Engineering!  Teleconference entitle, "Engineers Turning Ideas into Reality,"
              will be broadcast nationwide during National Engineers Week on Wednesday,
              February 26, 1998.  The special focus of the teleconference will be a very
              fast-paced, highly interactive look at the transition form high school to
              college, featuring a panel of three high school students, two undergraduates
              and two professional engineers.  The telecast is central to many local
              activities held during National Engineers Week wherein engineers welcome
              students and teachers to the workplace, providing tours and discussions, which
              are stimulated by the telecast.
