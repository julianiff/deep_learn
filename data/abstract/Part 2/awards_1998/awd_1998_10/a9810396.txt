Abstract    :
              Abstract  ANIR - 9810396  PI: Virginia Red  The University of the Arts 
              Philadelphia, PA   The  University of the Arts is connecting to the Internet
              using a T1 line.  Internet access will enable the university to increase
              available information resources in undergraduate courses, provide professional
              training for teachers in K-12 classrooms to take advantage of new tools and
              resources available across the state; and to expand their training in
              multimedia-intensive museum exhibitions at the graduate level. The award
              provides partial support of the project for two years.
