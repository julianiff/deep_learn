Abstract    :
              The Institute for Environmental Catalysis (IEC) at Northwestern University,
              directed by Dr. Peter C. Stair, supports an interdisciplinary research program
              on selective oxidation catalysis in industry and in the environment as well as
              a wide range of educational activities, including development of instructional
              materials and training programs for K-12 teachers.  The IEC is supported as an
              Environmental Molecular Science Institute (EMSI) and jointly funded by the NSF
              Division of Chemistry, MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and Division
              of Chemical and Transport Systems, and by the Chemical Sciences Division of the
              Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Department of Energy.

The IEC is organized
              into four collaborative research groups: molecular science of catalytic
              oxidation, chemical processing, emissions treatment, and natural environment. 
              Specific catalytic oxidation processes will be studied in the latter three
              while the first group will develop and provide tools required to obtain the
              molecular level information needed by the other groups.  Because of its
              importance in a broad range of industrial activities, the catalytic oxidation
              of organic compounds will be emphasized.  Examples of some problems that could
              be addressed more effectively by improved knowledge of catalysis are:  removal
              of NOX from combustion exhaust, efficiency of fossil fuel combustion, clean
              production of many useful chemicals, removal of pollutants from waste water
              streams, and transformation of pollutants to biodegradable forms.  The
              Institute is expected to have a major impact on improving process efficiency
              and reducing chemical waste from industrial processes and to serve as a
              national resource on environmental catalysis. 

The 49-member team of
              investigators includes 21 faculty from four Northwestern departments plus nine
              researchers from Argonne and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, and 19
              researchers from five (Allied Signal, Dow Chemical, Engelhard, Union Carbide,
              and UOP) industrial laboratories.  Approximately four postdoctoral fellows, 20
              graduate students, and five undergraduates will participate each year.
