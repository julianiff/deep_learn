Abstract    :
                          9810667  Barley    The purpose of this proposal is to develop and
              conduct a series of conferences that will facilitate a learning community among
              four Instructional Materials Development projects funded by ESIE.  A learning
              community of project staff with similar goals and objectives enables the
              achievement of the full potential of each project and addresses important
              issues and problems across projects.  Biannual networking conferences establish
              the framework for the learning community and support discussions to further the
              work.  The networking conferences and the work between sessions are developed
              with the close involvement of participating project staff to provide both
              process and impact components in shaping projects and establishing their
              efficacy.
