       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              project aims to develop a cell-mimic optical waveguide sensor (COWS) for
              real-time in-line biological pathogen testing. The COWS system, which combines
              molecular recognition synthetic membrane technology and optical guided wave
              sensor technology, will detect biological pathogens with speed, sensitivity,
              specificity, and simplicity. The concept of this technology is to mimic cell
              membranes that selectively and rapidly respond to numerous molecules.
              Artificial membranes are environmentally very stable and can be designed to
              undergo distinct chromatic transitions when such molecular recognition events
              occur at the surface of the membrane. The sensor chemistry will be synthesized
              on optical waveguides to enhance detection limits and sensitivity for
              absorption-based measurement. The Phase I work will study the feasibility of
              combining these two technologies. The farm-to-table food chain provides many
              opportunities for contamination. Food testing is required at every step in the
              production process, but a biosensor system that is comprehensive and practical
              for routine in-situ or in-line inspection is not available. 
       The
              ability to detect reliably and quickly the presence of biological pathogens is
              an important need in our society. A real-time sensor can be used to rapidly
              detect disease, in hospitals and in the home. It can also benefit food safety
              inspections, detection of biological weapons, and environmental monitoring.
