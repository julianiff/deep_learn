Research
              Instrumentation:  Instrumentation Grants for Research in CISE: Training in
              Virtual and Real Environments

This award supports the purchase of haptic and
              virtual reality based equipment and software to be used in the following
              research projects:
-  Use of Advancing Information Technology for Next
              Generation Training Systems,
-  Real-Time Multibody Dynamics for Virtual
              Environment Training Systems with Haptic User Interfaces,
-  Integration of
              Training Simulations with Operational Environments, and 
-  Develop a New
              Method for Locating Anatomical Structures in Multiple-Slice Image Data
              Sets.
The equipment will augment existing Virtual Environments Laboratory,
              providing critical facilities needed for research in developing and providing
              training technologies, addressing in particular, general training environments,
              war environments, and medical environments.   Furthermore, in medical image
              processsing, it will contribute in the development of a new method for locating
              anatomical structures.
