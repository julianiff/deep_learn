Abstract    :
              The proposed research program will continue the investigators examination of the
              Earth's magnetotail.  In particular they will be examining the conditions
              required for self consistent equilibria.  in particular, the proposed research
              program will extend current 2-dimensional models to three dimensions.  In
              addition, the research program will examine the importance of kinetic effects
              and the behavior and stability of thin current sheets.
