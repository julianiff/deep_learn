CISE Minority
              Institutions Infrastructure Program:  Computer Science at Fisk: Expanding the
              Minoriy Pipeline

This special project, funded by a combination of seven
              programs from two directorates (CISE and EHR) and various divisions (C-CR, DUE,
              EIA, IIS), includes the development and evaluation of a new course, "Exploring
              Computer Science," and use of CSAB criteria to provide guidance for general
              upgrade of the curriculum.  Moreover, the project supports in PIs in developing
              RUI proposals in those research areas of strength in this minority university,
              and contributes to develop more African American women in areas where the
              number of women and African American students are far from numerous.  Algorithm
              Design and Analysis, with emphasis in Graph Algorithms, and Biomedical
              Computing, with emphasis in Simulation and Modeling, Software and Hardware
              Design, as well as, Systems and Organizations, will be addressed specifically
              in the RUI proposals that will be developed.  The Fisk Research will be
              strengthened; consequently so will the students in this HBCU.  Through this
              effort, Fisk University is expected to develop further its computing science
              research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving
              the way for eventual increase in underrepresented degrees in the pipeline.  It
              is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model
              that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced
              technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.
