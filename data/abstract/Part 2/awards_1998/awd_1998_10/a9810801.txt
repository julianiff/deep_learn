Many animals are able to distinguish unfamiliar kin from
              nonkin by odor cues. How do chemical signals reveal whether or not individuals
              are genetically related? One possibility is that odor cues are influenced by
              genes that are very diverse, thus kin will share odors because they share
              versions (alleles) of these odor influencing genes. Genes of the major
              histocompatability complex (MHC) are postulated to play this kin recognition
              role in vertebrates because they are extremely diverse, they influence odor and
              they influence behavior expected to involve kin, including cooperation and
              inbreeding avoidance. This study tests a number of critical predictions of this
              hypothesis that are currently uncertain, and should provide important
              answers.
The proposed studies have several important implications. They will
              help to clarify how genes influence complex social behavior, one of the most
              puzzling problems in biology today. The research will help to unravel the
              genetic basis and development of chemosensory communication. This work will
              determine if MHC genes provide a genetic kin recognition system in mice. In
              addition the research has direct implications for humans because recent studies
              have found that women prefer the odor of MHC-dissimilar men and the marriage
              patterns predicted by such preferences have been found in some human
              populations.
