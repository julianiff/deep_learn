              Infrastructure Program-- FY 98  LEARN: Laboratory-Based Educational and
              Research Network  Project LEARN, (modeled as an extension to the Model
              Institution for Excellence initiative: MIE), enhances the Computer Science
              infrastructure through research and educational activities.  It promotes
              faculty development activities and supports minority faculty members as they
              complete there Ph.D. programs.  Through project LEARN, more students
              participate in faculty research in areas such as:  Agent-Based Systems, Spatial
              Data Analysis, Real-Time Operating Systems, and Pedagogical Research on
              Multimedia and Distance Learning applications.  This award will stir the
              department of Computer Science from 'mainly teaching' towards 'teaching and
              research'.  The existing MIE Summer Academy Program will be expanded to attract
              more minority/women students to pursue Computer Science studies at BSU.  A
              Student-based Support Network, enhancing the student-to-student academic
              support system and providing a forum for tutoring, mutual support and self
              realization), will be established.  Project LEARN makes a significant impact on
              the whole chain of issues which are related to minority student recruitment,
              mentoring, research assignments, financial support, academic performance
              monitoring, networking and group-based activities and placement in graduate
              schools.  Through this effort, Bowie State University is expected to develop
              further its computing science research capabilities involving minority students
              in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual increase in underrepresented
              degrees in the pipeline.  It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation
              might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and
              ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and
              future generations.
