Abstract    :
              9810096  Ghosh  A conference is conducted focusing on six major areas in 
              Mechanics and Materials: (a) crystal imperfections, (b)  polycrystals and
              properties, (c) constitutive modeling, (d)  plasticity and failure, (e) metal
              forming and casting, and  (f) process and product design. The conference
              provides  directions for industrial relevance of these topics. Current 
              obstacles and constraints to tailoring material properties  and to optimizing
              process and product designs are  identified.  ***
