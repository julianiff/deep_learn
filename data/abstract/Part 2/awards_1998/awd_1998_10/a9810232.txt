Abstract    :
              This project investigates the formation and effects of the French state's
              industrial and scientific policies during the Age of Revolution.  These
              policies and their implementation demonstrate how French bureaucrats hoped that
              improved technology would overcome Britain's industrial lead.  The project uses
              a cultural perspective to examine origins of the Industrial Revolution in
              France and to understand why France seemed to lag Britain in the development
              and utilization of new technology.  These issues will be examined through four
              case studies that investigate the nature and causes of French efforts to create
              a `culture of applied science.`  Cases will be developed through extensive
              archival research in Paris and the provinces.  The project will culminate in a
              book-length manuscript that explains why culture, particularly the nature and
              contours of a culture of applied science, is essential for understanding the
              application of science and technology.
