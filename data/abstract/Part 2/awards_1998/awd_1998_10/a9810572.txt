       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              project will demonstrate that a full-spectrum Raman analyzer prototype with no
              moving parts that incorporates a small, novel Raman optical-fiber based
              enhancement cell can rapidly measure Ethylene Oxide (EtO) and other gases down
              to low ppm levels. Raman's high degree of specificity minimizes signal
              cross-talk in complex multicomponent  systems. The spectra have narrow peaks
              which can be observed easily even in the presence of moisture. In order to make
              gas-phase Raman analysis affordable and practical we will use an off-the- shelf
              laser diode array as a light source. A proprietary external-cavity
              configuration will narrow the linewidth to around 10 cm-1. A simple,
              fiber-optic loop will enhance the circulating laser energy by approximately 10
              X to obtain sufficiently high laser energy for gas-phase detection at low
              concentrations. The Raman signal will be collected with a rugged, optically
              fast (f/1.4) volume- holographic spectrograph, and the full spectrum will be
              detected using a sensitive TE-cooled CCD array detector. This approach offers a
              simple, reliable instrument with no moving parts, for reduced maintenance and
              good stability. EtO is a colorless gas commonly used for sterilization of
              medical products that are temperature sensitive, which has been demonstrated to
              be a respiratory, skin, and eye irritant even at low concentrations (50 ppm).
              In addition, long-term exposure to EtO presents mutagenic, reproductive, and
              carcinogenic complications to humans. Below 700 ppm the odor of EtO cannot be 
              detected. A gas sensor is needed to rapidly monitor EtO.
        The proposed
              work will demonstrate the ease of use and breadth of application of Raman
              instrumentation compared to conventional IR, mass spectroscopy, or GC
              methodologies in a large U.S. market for industrial process analyzers.
