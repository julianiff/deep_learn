              postdoctoral fellowship: seismic  modeling  of  the  Oman  ophiolite and
              comparison with undershooting  data  from the East Pacific Rise    The  
              applicant's  thesis  included  a  detailed  structural  mapping  of  the 
              mantle section of presumed paleo-spreading  centers   in  the  Oman  ophiolite,
               and  a  microstructural  analysis  of peridotite samples from the studied
              areas.  The  aim  of  the proposed project is to use these field data  to 
              predict  seismic structure and thus to model ray  paths  and  travel  times
              through seismic models of the Oman paleo-ridge  mantle  flow. These synthetic
              seismic data will be  compared  to  the  results  of  recent seismic
              investigations  of  the  mantle, made at the East Pacific Rise, which use Pn
              waves to  undershoot  the  rise  in order to  map  the  isotropic  and 
              anisotropic structure of the shallow mantle.  A quantitative  comparison of the
              predicted seismic signatures of  the  Oman  ophiolite  with those observed
              along the East  Pacific  Rise  will allow us to ascertain if the mantle section
              of the Oman  ophiolite is comparable to that of the East Pacific Rise.
