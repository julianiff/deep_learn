This project will support a program of research on organosilicon
              polymers.  Materials to be synthesized and studied will include (a) new types
              of polysilanes with properties which may make them useful as fluorescent
              materials for radiation detection, as electroluminescent materials for display
              devices, as photoconductors, and as photorefractive materials for holographic
              data storage; (b) polysiloxanes which will complex alkali metal ions and may be
              useful as electrolytes in high energy-density batteries; and (c), polymers
              containing fullerene (C60) molecules which may be superior photoconductors and
              organic semiconductors.
In addition, the electronic properties of polysilanes
              will be investigated.  UV, Raman, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, combined
              with thermal measurements and X-ray crystallography, will be employed to
              elucidate the effects of conformational change on the properties of
              polysilanes.
%%%
This research is in the field of novel, silicon-based
              materials, which can have important potential applications in the areas of
              electronic and photonic devices.
