Abstract    :
              Abstract - Riley      This is a modeling study on turbulent, non-premixed,
              reacting flows focussing on issues related to the modeling of hydrogen and
              hydrocarbon diffusion flames burning in air.  Issues investigated include the
              applicability of large-eddy simulations (LES) to turbulent, combusting flows
              and the influence of differential diffusion of atomic and diatomic hydrogen
              under turbulent conditions.  The validity of large-eddy versions of the
              flamelet model is studied; comparisons of predictions from LES are made both
              with laboratory data and with the results of high-resolution, direct numerical
              simulations.  Validity of the modeling of differential diffusion is judged in
              the context of the Reynolds-averaged (or Favre-averaged) equations and also in
              the context of the large-eddy simulations.
