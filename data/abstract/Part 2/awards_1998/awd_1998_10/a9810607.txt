Abstract    :
              Limeburner  The variability of the inflow of Antarctic Bottom Water  (AABW) into
              the North Atlantic will be investigated by  deploying three, low cost, deep
              current meter moorings for 4  years. The site will be at the equator in the
              Western  basin of the Atlantic where a two-year record show a  possible warming
              trend accompanied by a decline in AABW  transport. The primary scientific
              question is to determine  whether this trend is real and associated with
              long-term  changes in circulation of the North Atlantic.
