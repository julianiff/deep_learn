Abstract    :
              9810299  Swallow      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. John R. Swallow of Davidson College to work
               with Dr. Jack Sonn at Technion-Israel Institute of  Technology in Haifa,
              Israel on the descent of quaternion  algebras and applications to Galois
              Theory.  They will  develop new, primarily constructive techniques for 1) the 
              realization of groups as Galois groups and 2) the  determination of the
              equivalence of quadratic forms over  number fields, using a theory of descent
              connecting  quadratic form theory with obstructions to central Galois 
              embedding problems.  One of the likely outcomes of this work  will be the
              realization of certain 2-groups that are not  known to occur.  This will
              provide connections between the  Inverse Galois Problem and the theory of
              quaternionic  algebras and quadratic forms.    Dr. Sonn is the leading expert
              in the theory of central  embedding problems.  ***
