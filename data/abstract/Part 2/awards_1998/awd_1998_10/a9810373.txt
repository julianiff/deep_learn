Abstract    :
                 Recent research suggests that prenatal undernutrition, reflected in low birth
              weight, permanently programs the metabolism of the fetus to function at low
              levels of nutritional resources, increasing the risk for obesity, hypertension,
              and cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life.  Although the programming
              hypothesis could help explain the current epidemic rise of these diseases in
              developing nations, where low birth weight is common, it has rarely been
              examined outside the US or Europe.  This study proposes to assess relationships
              between birth weight and standard CVD risk factors in Filipino adolescents
              living in metropolitan Cebu, the Phillipines.  In addition to collaboration
              with the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, blood pressure,
              adiposity, and cholesterol will be measured in over 400 randomly-selected low
              and high-birth weight individuals.  Birth weight data will be complimented by
              data on current diet, activity, and lifetime socioeconomic change to explore
              the interactions between pre- and postnatal factors in the expression of CVD
              risk factors in this modernizing population.  This study is significant in that
              it expands assessment of the programming hypothesis cross-culturally,
              approaches the problem of culture change and health from a novel developmental
              perspective, and may provide insights into nutritional adaptation and human
              adaptability.
