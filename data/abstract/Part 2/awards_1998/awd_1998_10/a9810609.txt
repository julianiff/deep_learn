Abstract    :
              Trowbridge  An extensive, high-quality data set of turbulence  measurements
              taken near the  bottom in the shallow near-shore environment of Duck, NC.  In
              this region,  energetic currents are forced by both winds and breaking  waves,
              and the motion  of water and sand is of primary scientific interest and 
              practical concern. This  project will provide direct estimates of turbulent
              Reynolds  shear stress and  indirect estimates of dissipation rates for
              turbulent  kinetic energy to test various  models of the energy balance in the
              near-shore region.
