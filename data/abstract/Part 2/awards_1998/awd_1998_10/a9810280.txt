Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS.  Applications include
              projects in remote instrumentation for advanced electron microscopy,
              computational and fluid dynamics and manufacturing processes, and simulation of
              plasma behavior in nuclear fusion containment devices.  Collaborating
              institutions include Pennsylvania State, Drexel, University of Pennsylvania,
              Northwestern, Oak Ridge National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Sandia and NIST.
