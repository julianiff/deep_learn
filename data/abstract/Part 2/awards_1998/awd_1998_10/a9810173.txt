              Software:  The  MIT  RAW Machine    A Raw Machine is an architecture that may
              be suitable for billion-transistor chips.  It combines a replicated set of
              processors with integrated configurable logic, coupled by point to point
              interconnect, and a compiler system that discovers and schedules
              instruction-level parallelism across the tiles.  A Raw architecture eliminates
              the traditional instruction set interface and instead exposes the raw details
              of the hardware directly to the compiler.    This project is evaluating a Raw
              architecture through simulation and compiler development.  Research questions
              to be addressed include the balance of area devoted to memory, computation, and
              communication on the chip; implementation of a parallelizing compiler; extent
              to which static communication can be used by the compiler and run-time system;
              comparison with similar approaches such as multiscalar architectures and VLIW;
              and efficiency with which runtime software techniques can enhance the static
              Raw architecture.
