Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project will focus on how the content and methods of
              modern physics research extended beyond academia into industrial and government
              institutions.  This process will be revealed by linking Edward Condon's early
              experience as a leading theoretical physicist at Princeton University to his
              subsequent and largely unknown role as a scientist and research manager at the
              Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, the National Bureau of 
              Standards, and the Corning Glass Works.  Examining Condon's efforts to reform
              the content, practice, and organization of basic scientific research in
              industry and government during the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold
              War will provide a unique opportunity to study the impact of individual
              initiative on institutional change in twentieth century America.  This
              dissertation will be of particular interest to historians of science and
              business historians seeking alternatives to the commonly held assumption that
              scientific knowledge is created in the university and simply applied to
              industry.
