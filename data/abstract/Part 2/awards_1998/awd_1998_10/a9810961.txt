Abstract    :
              9810961  Sen      This project will investigate the melting process beneath  a 
              90  million  year old mid-oceanic ridge using trace  element  and isotopic
              characteristics of  lithospheric xenoliths from  Oahu,  Hawaii.  REE  and Nd,
              Sr isotopic  analysis  will  be  obtained on clinopyroxenes from a suite of
              spinel lherzolite  and  rare plagioclase  lherzolite xenoliths. These data will
               be  used  to  (1)  verify  the source  compositions  of  the  xenoliths,  (2)
              determine the melt production rates  (dF/dP)  over a depth at less than 0.5
              Gpa, (3) evaluate the role  of  melt  refertilization, and (4) reconstruct the
              super-solidus  melting  trajectory (i.e., mantle flow lines) from  pyroxene 
              thermobarometry.
