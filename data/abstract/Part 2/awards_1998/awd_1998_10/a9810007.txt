Abstract    :
              9810007  Hallock    This  award  provides partial support for a Symposium on 
              Quantum Fluids and Solids that will be held in Amherst, MA  on June  9-14, 1998
               on  the  campus  of  the University of  Massachusetts.  The Symposium  will 
              emphasize new  developments  in  low  temperature physics in the area of 
              quantum fluids and solids, including BoseEinstein  condensation (BEC), and will
              have sessions  devoted  to  instrumentation  and  techniques.  The  conference 
               will  bring together  practitioners  from the atomic physics  community,  who
              have  been working at ultralow temperatures  in order achieve BEC, and 
              traditional low temperature  physicists, who  use  liquid  or solid  helium  or
               adiabatic demagnetization methods  to  achieve ultralow  temperatures. The NSF
              support will be used  to  provide  travel  funds for graduate students or
              younger faculty to  attend the Symposium.  %%%  This  awards provides partial
