Abstract    :
              This investigator has recently found that low molecular weight displacers can be
              used to facilitate hydrophobic interaction (HIC) and reversed phase (RPLC)
              chromatographic systems.  This proposal will attempt to capture the benefits of
              the displacement and adsorption mechanisms in one system capable of both high
              throughput and selectivity.  Low molecular weight displacers will be identified
              for a range of proteins for both HIC and RPLC, and separation isotherms
              developed for these systems.  Operational problems such as displacer removal
              and recovery, column regeneration, and optimization of the resolving power will
              be investigated.  Finally, the hybrid method will be tested by separating
              proteins from complex biological mixtures.
