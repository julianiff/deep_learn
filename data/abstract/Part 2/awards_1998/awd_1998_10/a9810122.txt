Abstract    :
              ECS-9810122  Levan      The First International Conference on Semigroups of
              Operators, Theory and Applications, a four-day conference from December 14
              through 18, 1998, will be held in the Marriott Hotel, Newport Beach,
              California.    The Conference will be the First of its kind in the US and,
              perhaps, elsewhere as well.    The Conference will concentrate on the abstract
              theory of Semigroups of Operators as well as Applications which include
              relevant areas of Science and Engineering, for example: Control Engineering
              (Structures, Aeroelasticity), Mathematical Physics; in addition to areas within
              Mathematics such as PDE and Stochastic Processes.    The key topics include: 
              (i)   New Results in Semigroups Theory and Application of Semigroups Theory to
              PDE and Stochastic Progress.  (ii)  Strong Stability and Stabilizability. 
              (iii) Applications to Problems in Control Engineering, including Structure and
              Aeroelasticity.  (iv)  Applications to Problems in Mathematical Physics.    The
              Conference Program will consist of plenary lectures, invited papers as well as
              contributed papers.    The Conference will be announced in the AMS Bulletin and
              on the Web, as well as by mailing of Call-For Papers.    A Conference
              Proceeding will be published.
