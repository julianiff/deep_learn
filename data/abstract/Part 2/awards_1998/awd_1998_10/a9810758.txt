This project will document the flux and fate of fluvial
              sediments to (and within) the marine environment. Rivers draining northern New
              Guinea discharge onto a very narrow shelf (hence most sediment escapes to the
              deep sea) whereas southern rivers discharge onto a broader shelf (only some of
              the sediment presumably escapes); this comparative with will be conducted from
              an Australian oceanographic ship. The effect episodic changes of fluvial
              sediment supply to the coastal zone will be studied in the vicinity of the
              Yellow River, in a cooperative research project with scientists at Ocean
              University and Academia Sinica, both located in Qingdao, China.  A final aspect
              of the study will be the synthesis of existing data, with particular emphasis
              on environmental factors and events that influence fluvial discharge to the
              ocean.
