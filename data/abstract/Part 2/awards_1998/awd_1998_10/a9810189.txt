Abstract    :
               Multimode optical fibers are expected to comprise 15% of the world optical
              fiber market by the year 2000.  The large cores of these fibers permit them to
              be used with inexpensive light sources, and they are best suited for
              applications in Local Area Networks.  At the present time, there are no
              suitable fabrication techniques to make large graded index preforms.  The
              investigator will research the possibility of using organic precursors
              containing Si (but with no Cl)  that react with oxygen to produce large amounts
              of silicon dioxide.    The reacted silicon dioxide will impinge on a rotating
              rod and an unsintered cylinder of the silicon dioxide will be formed.  During
              the deposition, the silicon dioxide will be doped with a glass modifier that
              will raise the index of refraction.  This will be done with computer control to
              ensure a smooth gradation of the refractive index, and thus, high bandwidth
              functionality.  This preform is then sintered to produce a vitreous, pore free
              preform with graded index.     It is believed that this process is
              environmentally friendly (no chlorine), and that the large preforms will
              significantly reduce the manufacturing costs of high bandwidth multimode
              optical fibers.
