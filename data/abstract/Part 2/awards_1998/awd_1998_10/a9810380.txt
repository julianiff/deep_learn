Abstract    :
                This research explores the ways in which candidates choose their political
              platforms when facing complex decision problems.  This research uses spatial
              theory to locate voters and relies on previous theoretical results that show
              how voters make decisions when choosing among candidates in complex policy
              spaces.  This research extends what has previously been done by focusing on the
              ways that candidates build their platforms when facing voters who have
              preferences across very complex policy spaces.  While the standard models show
              that disequilibrium is common and that candidates can occupy any position in a
              complex space, this research points out that these theoretical problems are
              often quickly solved by human actors.  The research uses laboratory experiments
              to test predictions about how candidates behave when the number of voters is
              varied, when the information about voter location is varied, and when the
              complexity of the policy space is varied.  This research sheds light on the
              ways in which candidates handle very complex decision problems.
