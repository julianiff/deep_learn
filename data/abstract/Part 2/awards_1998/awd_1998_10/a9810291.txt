Abstract    :
              9810291  Jose Roesset    This award to the Engineering Research Center entitled
              "Offshore Technology Research Center (OTRC)" at Texas A&M University/University
              of Texas will develop an integrative multidisciplinary summer institute program
              in offshore engineering for regular graduate students working at the OTRC,
              graduate students at other universities who are completing or are about to
              complete their degree requirements and plan to work for offshore companies, and
              practicing engineers who may consider it as a continuing education program.  
              The summer institute will be organized around an integrated design project
              involving an offshore facility, starting with economic and political
              considerations and then progressing to the actual planning and design. In
              parallel with this ongoing design experience where the students will work in
              collaborative teams, the students will also take a series of one-week modular
              courses covering related material:  offshore economics, environmental policy
              and regulations, risk assessment and management, project planning and
              execution, teams and teamwork, technical communications, etc.  These courses
              will be planned and scheduled so that their material can be integrated into the
              design process.   The OTRC research on seafloor characterization and
              foundations and behavior of composite materials in the marine environment, as
              well as developed software on fluid-structure interaction, will be integrated
              into the summer institute.  Models of student designs will be evaluated using
              OTRC's wave basin facility.
