Abstract    :
              DMI-9810739  Schafrik  The objective of the conference is to focus expertise
              from a broad spectrum of disciplines to synthesize the core of new concepts for
              the development of a science of engineering design, integration engineering and
              manufacture. Experts from fields related to engineering, manufacturing,
              economics, operations research, decision theory, game theory, mathematics,
              business and others will be brought together in this unique six day conference
              to discuss means of moving engineering from its current analysis focus toward a
              focus that includes human values and choice.  A series of sessions is planned
              that will lead the conference participants into discussions of specific topics
              and issues, lead by well known experts in the various fields. Topics will
              include distributed design, integration engineering, producibility, and
              management of design and manufacture teams.   The conference will follow the
              established Gordon Conference format, with morning and evening sessions, and
              afternoons held free for small group interactions.
