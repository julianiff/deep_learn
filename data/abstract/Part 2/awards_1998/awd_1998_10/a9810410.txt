Abstract    :
                This project focuses on the extent to which deregulation of national laws
              liberalizing international finance is predictable from the degree of
              democratization.  Two hypotheses are being tested.  First, sustained
              international financial liberalization arises from sustained democratic
              political contestation and that sustained liberalization leads to and
              enablement cycle.  Second, the absence of sustained democratic contestation
              will lead to restrictive or highly variable international financial policies.
              These lead to a repression cycle.  This project extends the PIs prior work in
              which data from 64 counties were cataloged.  In the current effort, data from
              an additional 60 countries, mostly poor and less stable and democratic in
              comparison to those previously assessed, will be cataloged.  In addition, data
              for the years 1994 through 1996 are being added for the originally cataloged
              countries.  The core hypotheses are examined using cross-sectional regression
              analyses.  The dynamic of the contemporaneous relationship between
              liberalization and political economic performance are examined using pooled,
              time-series, cross-sectional regressions.  This research addresses one of the
              central developments of modern political economics and extends a dataset of
              great value to other sociolegal researchers.
