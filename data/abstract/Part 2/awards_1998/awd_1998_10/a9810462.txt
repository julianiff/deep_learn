Abstract    :
              9810462  Andle       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
              project will allow future development of prototype in-process-line systems to
              test in several potential food-related applications. Three major subsystems
              will be considered for development under Phase I using apple juice as the model
              food matrix and Escherichia coli 0157:H7 as the target pathogen. The first
              subsystem to be demonstrated will extract microbial material from a liquid
              solution, followed by the disruption of the collected bacteria. The second
              subsystem will extract DNA from the microbial lysate and present concentrated
              template DNA to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. Finally,
              PCR-amplified DNA will be selectively detected using previously demonstrated
              piezoelectric sensor technology. The proposed project deals with food borne
              disease that is a major cause of morbidity in the U. S. Microbial pathogens
              account for up to 33 million cases of foodborne illness each year and up to
              9,000 deaths, resulting in substantial costs to the national economy.
              Traditional methods for detecting foodborne pathogens are unduly time
              consuming, labor intensive and in some cases not sensitive enough. The Hazard
              Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been developed by
              regulatory agencies and is being adopted by food processors. In order for
              microbiological testing to be useful in a HACCP setting, real-time
              in-process-line techniques must be developed.        The testing and
              food-related uses for this technology are in liquid food applications, fruit
              juice processing, poultry and meat processing, minimally processed vegetable
              products, EPA drinking water testing, and biochemical warfare detection.
