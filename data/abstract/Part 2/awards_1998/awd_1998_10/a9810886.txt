Abstract    :
                The goal of this dissertation is to provide a description of the Yuchi
              language, a language isolate spoken by only twelve elderly Yuchi around
              Sapulpa, Oklahoma, USA. Yuchi has never been fully documented. I will provide a
              comprehensive description of Yuchi phonology, morphology, and syntax. In
              addition to the grammatical description, I will discuss issues in Yuchi syntax
              that directly affect current theories of the nature and structure of
              polysynthetic languages. I will also include texts and a brief lexicon. The
              primary data for this study is material collected in original field work with
              the remaining speakers. This project is urgent due to the small number,
              advanced age and fragile health of these speakers.  Linguistic descriptions of
              little known languages, especially endgangered languages, are a fundamental and
              permenant contribution to linguistics. On all levels of the grammar, Yuchi
              exhibits unique structures which contribute to our understanding of language
              typology and linguistic parameters. This dissertation has immediate application
              for comparative linguists interested in the prehistory of the Southeast and
              population movements in the Americas. In addition, a grammar of Yuchi is of
              utmost importance to the Yuchi tribe for documentation and preparation of
              language teaching materials.
