Abstract    :
              This dissertation project focuses on the case study used by late nineteenth
              century psychiatry.  Although historians have studied the emergence of the case
              study as a technique of medical observation, they have had nothing to say about
              its subsequent evolution as a narrative form,  This project argues that a study
              of the case must begin with its narrative elements, with the content of the
              form. The project asserts that in addition to becoming a more formalized
              document over the course of the century, the case study in psychiatric medicine
              evolved from being a story about the progression of a particular disease-entity
              in a person to being a story about the individual himself.  The project seeks
              to address the ways institutional, or discursive, `memories` affect the
              personal memory of `pathological` mental states and the internalization of
              `abnormal` identities in individuals.  By focusing in the latter part of the
              study on the medical discourses about, and case studies of, men who were
              described as `inverts` or `homosexuals` around the moment when those
              classifications came into being, the project uses the emergence of
              homosexuality in the late nineteenth century as a case study of the deployment
              of the technique itself.  The project not only contributes to current debates
              regarding the social construction and emergence of the `homosexual,` nor simply
              describes the evolution of a particular scientific genre in France, but also
              addresses much broader theoretical issues in the history and philosophy of
              science that cut across temporal, national, and disciplinary boundaries: the
              relationship of discourses to people, and the relationships among specificity
              (cases), comparison, and knowledge.
