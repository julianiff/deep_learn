Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9810845    Principal Investigator: Qing Hu (MIT)     Title:
              Terahertz Lasers Basedon Intersubband Transitions        Abstract    The
              proposal is to develop tunable solid-state terahertz lasers based on
              intersubband transitions in quantum well cascade.  The target frequency (1 - 10
              THz) represents a technologically important region between traditional
              microwave and optical technologies. Closely related theoretical and
              experimental work will be conducted for the realization of the THz laser source
              that will have wide applications for spectroscopy in chemistry and biology,
              plasma diagnotics, astrophysics, imaging, and communications.
