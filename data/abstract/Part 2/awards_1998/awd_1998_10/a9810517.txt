Abstract    :
              Czech belongs to the family of Slavic languages, which exhibit phenomena that
              will prove challenging to speech recognition.  The characteristics of a high
              degree of inflection, a high degree of derivation, a relatively free word
              order, and having phones that appear in no other language make speech
              recognition difficult.  The development of a large vocabulary speaker
              independent continuous speech recognizer for Czech is proposed as a
              collaborative effort between Johns Hopkins' Center for Language and Speech
              Processing and three university teams from the Czech Republic.  The proposed
              research is attempting to take advantage of the synergistic opportunities
              offered by the experience and tools of Johns Hopkins researchers, by the
              capabilities of the Czech partners, and by the existence of extensive text
              resources in their possession.  The research cooperation will forge
              international scientific ties and create new centers of language engineering
              excellence outside the United States.
