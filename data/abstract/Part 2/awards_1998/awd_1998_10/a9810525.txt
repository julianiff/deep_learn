Abstract    :
                Mike Snyder, Director of the Pacific Rim Initiative, and other staff of the
              American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will provide
              logistical support for a group of 20 high school students and their chaperones
              to attend a Youth Science Festival sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic
              Cooperation forum (APEC), hosted by Korea in Seoul,  August 14-20, 1998. The
              U.S. students will be selected from nominations provided by PI's who have
              received NSF Young Scholar awards.  At this event, they will join contingents
              from the 18 member economies of APEC.  The Festival's objectives include
              introducing young people to various fields of science and technology as future
              career possibilities, and fostering mutual understanding and future cooperation
              among budding scientists and engineers of the region.   The  Festival will
              feature exhibits, demonstrations, presentations and experiments in a wide range
              of science and technology fields, some by senior researchers and educators and
              some by the young participants, as well as cultural events, field trips, and
              social activities.   The PI will work with the U.S. travelers to fulfill all
              requirements and arrangements for the delegation to travel to Korea and
              participate in the festival. In addition, through guidance before and during
              the trip and follow-up afterwards, the PI will endeavor to ensure a meaningful
              cross-cultural experience for the participants.
