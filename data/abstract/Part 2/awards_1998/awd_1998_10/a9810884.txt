Abstract    :
              Business groups are a special type of enterprise organization existing in almost
              every market economy. Usually they play a significant role in the development
              of these economies. Although their distinct organizational structure and close
              relationships with economic growth have attracted much attention, there is no
              satisfactory explanation for this organizational form. This doctoral
              dissertation research project will study the formation, evolution, and economic
              performance of Taiwanese top 100 business groups. In contrast to
              market-centered theories, cultural arguments, and neo-institutionalism in
              organizational sociology, it proposes that a modified institutional perspective
              is more appropriate to study these issues. Preliminary studies will employ
              descriptive analyses of several longitudinal data sets. Based on the
              preliminary findings, the project will investigate the growth patterns of 150
              business groups, along with structural changes in 234 business groups in 1973,
              1986, and 1994. The methods to be used include loglinear models, network
              analysis, and regression statistics. These studies will not only increase our
              understanding of business groups and contribute to establishing a general
              theory of economic organizations, but also shed light on East Asian economic
              development.
