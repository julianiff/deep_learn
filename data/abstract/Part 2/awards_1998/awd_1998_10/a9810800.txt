Abstract    :
              Marotzke  A mix of theoretical approaches, simplified numerical models  and an
              idealized  Ocean General Circulation Model will be used to  understanding the
              role of  boundary mixing in determining integral properties and the  rotating
              dynamics of  the thermohaline circulation (THC). Of particular interest  are
              the following  questions: (1) how do wind and buoyancy forcing, together  with
              mixing at the  margins, determine the strength and dynamics of the THC; (2) 
              what are the  effects of variable buoyancy forcing on mixed layer  evolution,
              the zonal mean  density gradient, and hence the THC; and (3) what the  effects
              of inhomogeneities  in mixing, either through topography or between hemispheres
               or ocean basins.
