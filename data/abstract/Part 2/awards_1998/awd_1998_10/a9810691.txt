Abstract    :
              9810691  Raubenheimer    The project is for an analysis and modeling study of
              swash  zone processes.  Specifically, it will:  1) develop models  describing
              interactions between wave runup, wave setup,  tides, and the beach watertable; 
              and 2) validate these  models with existing field observations collected near 
              Torrey Pines Beach, CA and Duck, NC.   The study will  improve understanding of
              the infiltration effect on swash  zone fluid motion and benefits future studies
              of swash zone  sediment transport.
