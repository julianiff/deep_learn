Abstract    :
              9810699  Storm  This award supports the attendance of advanced U.S. graduate 
              students at the 1998 Gordon Research Conference on the  Chemistry and Physics
              of Nanostructure Fabrication.  The  conference, to be held June 21-26, 1998 at
              the Tilton  College in NH, is being organized by John Randall of Texas 
              Instruments (Chairman) and Christie R. K. Marrian of the  Naval Research
              Laboratory (Chairman-Elect).  The science of  nanostructure fabrication is
              vital not only to today's  information revolution but to the fields of imaging
              and  manipulation of chemical and biological structures.  Future  progress in
              all these disciplines is paced by advances in  the science and technology of
              nanofabrication that will be  discussed at this conference.  The conference
              format - a  week of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated  fields
              in a casual setting - provides a particularly  rewarding oppourtunity for
              graduate students to exchange  ideas with and to learn from this gathering of
              leading  researchers.  %%%  ***
