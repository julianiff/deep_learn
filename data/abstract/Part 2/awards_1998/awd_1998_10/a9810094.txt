Abstract    :
                                                9810094  Storm    A Gordon Research Conference
              will be held July 12-17, 1998 on  theoretical and experimental aspects of
              defects and defect-  related phenomena in homogeneous and structured
              semiconductors,  associated with growth and processing of electronic materials.
               Topics which are controversial and/or forward-looking will be  emphasized. The
              program is organized around 20 invited speakers,  11 discussion leaders, a
              chair, vice-chair, and program  committee; both contributed papers and posters
              are scheduled.  Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad 
              community of researchers who address defects from a variety of  disciplinary
              backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and  materials science, and to
              formulate and delineate critical  research necessary to further basic
              understanding and move  concepts closer to technological success. The
              conference is  expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of
              critical  scientific issues in the area of defects in semiconductors. Along 
              with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions,  it is expected
              that new ties will be established between  universities, research institutions,
              and industry.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of defects and
              defect-  related phenomena in semiconductors associated with growth and 
              processing of electronic materials and device related structures  along with
              current assessments of the most important developments  in this field will be
              of great value to the understanding and  enhanced utilization of materials in
              computing, data processing,  and communications.  ***
