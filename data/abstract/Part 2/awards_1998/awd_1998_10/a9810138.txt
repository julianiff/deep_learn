Abstract    :
              The objective of this RPG is to assist the PI in developing a full  proposal in
              the area of Distributed Memory Computers (DMCs). Code  optimization is an
              important part for today's high performance  DMCs. This research concentrates
              on developing new techniques for  performing interprocedural analysis for high
              performance computing  applications.  This information is vital in order to
              allow further  transformations of the code in optimizing compiler. This
              research  will initially be based on tools available over the Internet such  as
              Parafrase and MPI. These packages will be imported and changes  to the code
              will be performed in order to test our algorithms on  various application
              programs. This project includes a component  for undergraduate education at the
              University of Puerto Rico-  Mayaguez. These students will be heavily involved
              in using the  available tools for  interprocedural analysis and in developing 
              and testing new strategies.
