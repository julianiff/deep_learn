Abstract    :
              Abstract   ANIR-9810444  PI:  Joseph A. Roos  Christ the King Seminary  East
              Aurora, New York        This proposal requests funds for the installation of a
              T1 line that will connect Christ the King Seminary to the Internet. Internet
              access will promote the sharing of information and the dissemination of
              research results. It also allows faculty to explore areas of interest,
              integrate new methodologies of teaching into their coursework; and facilitates
              the computerization of the library's collection. The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
