Abstract    :
              It is a disturbing fact of contemporary American society that the children of
              immigrant minorities perform better in secondary school than the children of
              nonimmigrant minorities.  It seems as if children learn how to underperform
              through their experience in school. This research will study the secondary
              school culture of young Latino students in a comprehensive California high
              school serving European-American and Mexican-American students.  The
              researchers, an anthropologist and her students, will document the role of high
              school peer relations in constructing student identities and orienting students
              away from, or towards academic performance. It will document how attitudes
              about race, gender and class are mediated through the interaction and
              conversations of peers in the school setting, study the role of peer
              affiliations in encounters between students and school personnel, looking at
              how power dynamics influence students' feelings about formal learning, and
              study how some student groups define themselves with or against other student
              categories in status, and how this affects the academic engagement of groups
              and individual students.  The methodology will be ethnographic participant
              observation, focus groups, event interpretation analysis, and semi-structured
              interviews with a sample of Latino students in the class of 2002.  This case
              study will contribute towards advancing our theoretical understanding of the
              reasons why students develop an adversarial position against learning and
              academic performance.  The results will be useful to planners and academic
              administrators as well as to the community at large concerned about education.
