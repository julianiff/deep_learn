Abstract    :
              9810581  de Wet    This grant provides support for the acquisition of a magnetic
               mapping system for the Department of Geosciences at Franklin &  Marshall
              College.  The system will include a cesium vapor  gradiometer and GPS unit as
              well as computer hardware and  software for data processing, manipulation and
              presentation.  The system will be used by several faculty in the Geosciences 
              Department for a variety of environmental, archaeological and  geologic
              applications. Co-PI's Andrew de Wet and Rob Sternberg  are interested in the
              environmental applications of the equipment  including the determination of
              subsurface conditions at former  industrial sites in order to better understand
              the areal extent  and environmental legacy of these activities.  Rob Sternberg
              is  also interested in archaeological applications of the equipment  including
              the magnetic and paleomagnetic characteristics of  historic kilns, and detailed
              magnetic surveys at historic and  prehistoric archaeological sites for the
              delineation of sites and  the identification of structures and features. 
              Magnetic studies  are also planned for further elucidation of the structure of
              the  Martic Line in Lancaster County, PA, which separates  Precambrian/Lower
              Cambrian metamorphic rocks from Lower Paleozoic  sedimentary rocks.  The
              involvement of undergraduates in research  using the magnetic mapping system is
              a high priority.  ***
