Abstract    :
                    9810654    Abstract    Funds are solicited to support the Third
              International Butterfly Ecology and Evolution Symposium: Butterflies as Model
              Systems, to be held in Crested Butte, Colorado.  This meeting is necessary to
              foster stronger interactions among researchers in a variety of disciplines who
              use butterflies as their study systems.  These interactions will lead to
              synergy in the development of new ideas, concepts, and tests within and across
              ecology, evolution, behavior, development, genetics, and systematics.  Funds
              will primarily allow graduate students and international participants to attend
              the meeting.
