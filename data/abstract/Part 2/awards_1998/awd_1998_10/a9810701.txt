Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research investigates agrarian protest in France from
              1980 to 1995. During this period, agrarian collective action was chronic and
              ubiquitous, frequently crossing national borders. For example, demonstrations
              in Brussels and Geneva included French farmers, and protests in Strasbourg
              against the Common Agricultural Policy Reforms included farmers from France,
              Germany, and Switzerland. Protest and network data will be collected in
              selected French localities to answer the following questions. (1) What are the
              sources of agrarian protest? (2) What effect does agrarian contention have on
              institutionalized agricultural politics? (3) Does this recent pattern of
              farmers' mobilization reflect the Europeanization of the agricultural conflict
              system? The research will test the hypothesis that expanding political
              opportunities in the 1980s enabled dissident farmers to broaden their
              constituency and to establish new interorganizational links. As a result,
              farmers forged a common front against the neocorporatist agreements that
              previously dictated agricultural policy. This project contributes to the
              research on multi-level governance in the European Union and the
              transnationalization of contention by exploring relations between the
              "national" and the "local" political arenas of agricultural politics, and by
              examining the concrete organizational foundations of "multilevel governance."
