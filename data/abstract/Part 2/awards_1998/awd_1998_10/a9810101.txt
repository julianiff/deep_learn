              ABSTRACT  "High Performance Internet Access for University of Delaware 
              Scientific and Engineering Research"  University of Delaware  PI: Daniel Grim 
              ANI-9810101        This award is made under the high performance connections
              portion of  ANIR's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It
              provides partial support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. 
              Applications include projects in ocean dynamics and atmospheric circulation,
              modeling of ocean circulation and coastal waves, meteorological and climate
              analysis, astrophysical modeling, computational fluid dynamics, molecular
              phusics, internetworking research, natural language and gestural analysis,
              video-based sign language communications, petaflop supercomputer design, and
              remote experimental chemical analysis.  Collaborating institutions include
              Drexel University, George Washington University, Cal Tech/JPL, Notre Dame, SUNY
              Stony Brook, McGill, NASA-Goddard, Georgia Tech, Michigan, Carnegie-Mellon,
              MIT, UCLA, USC, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
