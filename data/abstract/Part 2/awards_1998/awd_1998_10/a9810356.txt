Abstract    :
              9810356  Newey    This project develops improved methods for drawing inferences
              from economic data.  The methods should help make more accurate margin of error
              predictions for economic data in several important applications.  The proposal
              includes two specific projects and extensions:  (1) Efficient bootstrapping in
              semiparametric models: Bootstrapping is a resampling method that can be used to
              improve the accuracy of margin of error predictions.  The degree of improvement
              can depend on how the bootstrapping is done.  This project develops a theory
              for determining the most efficient bootstrap available.  Preliminary results
              indicate that there is large potential for improvement from an efficient
              bootstrap.  New applications of the efficient bootstrap will be used to further
              illustrate the potential gain.  (2) Selecting the number of moment conditions:
              Generalized method of moment estimators have many applications in economics,
              including estimation of program evaluation models and dynamic models of growth
              using a time series of cross-sections.  Often there are many more moment
              conditions than parameters available and it is important to know how to choose
              among them.  This research will develop a method based on the tradeoff between
              bias and variability.  The theoretical properties of this method will be
              studied and applications provided.  Also, the practical value of this approach
              will be evaluated in some small simulation studies.
