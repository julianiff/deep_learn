Abstract    :
              Both microprocessor performance and on-chip densities have  been growing
              exponentially for decades. This trend shows no  signs of abatement. However,
              interchip communication costs  are not improving nearly as rapidly, so that if
              present  trends continue, computation will increasingly be limited by 
              pin-bandwidth constraints, or by exotic packaging costs.  This project is
              focused on architectures that will address  the emerging bandwidth limitations
              in order to build cost-  effective, high-performance systems. In particular, we
              are  investigating (1) future memory hierarchies, exploring  alternatives at
              the levels of physical design, logical  organization, and system design; (2)
              DataScalar  architectures, exploiting redundant computations to minimize 
              communication requirements; and (3) Hybrid parallel  execution, combining the
              DataScalar ideas with parallel  threads to support multiple computation models 
              simultaneously.
