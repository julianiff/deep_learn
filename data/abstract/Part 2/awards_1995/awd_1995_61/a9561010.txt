Abstract    :
              9561010  Fernandez         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Project will develop a novel in situ fluorescence lifetime-based sensor for
              determination of small-scale phytoplankton distribution and physiological
              status. A method will be developed to determine phytoplankton physiological
              status from determination of cholorophyll a fluorescence lifetimes, and an
              inexpensive, rugged, compact instrument will be designed to implement the
              method in situ. Lifetime sensing will be performed using phase fluorometry. The
              instrument implementation is based on the use of a cross-correlation method
              using a modulated light-emitting diode (LED) as a light source and digital data
              acquisition an analysis. A resolution of the order of 10 ps will permit
              accurate determination of cholorophyll fluorescence lifetime changes that are
              know to occur under various physiological conditions.  This may be the first
              oceanographic phytoplankton sensor to exploit fluorescence lifetime sensing.   
                 Potential commercial applications range from oceanographic sensing to
              laboratory research. Potential markets include plant nursery, breeding, tissue
              culture, plant genetic engineering, on -line process analysis in bioreactors,
              and aquaculture.
