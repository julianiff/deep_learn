Abstract    :
                     This small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              a rapid prototyping procedure for new products which incorporate microprocessor
              technology.  Today, development of each new microprocessor controlled product
              involves custom design of both hardware and software, in many cases duplicating
              functionality previously implemented in earlier products.  This process of
              re-inventing much that has already been done often requires an extended R&D
              cycle and unnecessarily large costs.  An alternative to this approach to
              prototyping is designated Computer Alded Prototyping (CAP).  Phase I research
              will configure a new product prototype with proven hardware and proven software
              using a personal computer click-and-drag scheme as the configuration tool. 
              Unique hardware design, unique software design, and unique merging concepts
              will be studied.  The result will be a practical CAP concept.        The CAP
              concept is expected to make a drastic reduction in the cost and time required
              to prototype a new product.  No longer would it be necessary for teams of
              engineers and programmers to spend months or years designing, coding,
              compiling, and debugging prototypes.  Technicians trained in the CAP Procedure
              will be able to use a PC to build a working prototype in a matter of days or
              weeks.  CAP would find wide commercial use in the electronics industry in that
              virtually every such product contains a microprocessor chip.  Other potential
              arenas of application include, but are not limited to, medical devices, office
              equipment, and manufacturing processes and control.
