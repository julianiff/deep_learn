Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate an ultra high-precision position sensing system, intended for next
              generation microelectronics production.  Before a product prototype of this
              system can be developed, which is suitable for rigorous use in commercial
              manufacturing, design issues related to reliability, high speed capability, and
              manufacturability must be solved.  The new system uses scanning probe
              microscope (SPM) technology and some reference scale such as a synthetic
              grating or an atomic layer of crystal.  This unique combination, together with
              synchronized signal detection, is an innovation in the area of ultra high
              precision position sensing, which is basic to high precision positioning
              systems (XY stage control) in microelectronics manufacturing.  Subnanometer
              precision (repeatability) has been demonstrated both in the height and lateral
              direction.  Phase I will study the system design which fully utilizes the
              integrated micromachined sensor probe and actuator, establishing a dynamic
              model.       Three areas of application are anticipated in commercial
              microelectronics manufacturing: 1)steppers, electron/ion beam lithography
              systems, mask aligners, and inspection systems for X-ray lithography;
              2)inspection and manufacturing systems of high-precision X-ray optics and other
              high precision machining systems; and 3)servo writer control systems for
              computer hard disk and optical disk mass memory.
