Abstract    :
              95-61553  Alford     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will attempt to demonstrate that metallofullerenes can be efficiently and
              economically purified via electrochemical processes. Metallofullerenes are
              closed carbon cage molecules containing a trapped metal atom or atoms. They are
              a unique new class of molecules with a variety of potential industrial
              applications. Because the encapsulated metal atom transfers its electrons to
              the fullerene shell, metallofullerenes have a substantially different
              electronic structure than empty fullerenes. An electrochemical purification
              process based on this large difference has the potential of radically reducing
              the cost of purifying metallofullerenes as compared to the current purification
              method which utilizes a very expensive and time consuming two step
              chromatography process.   The prohibitive cost of this chromatography process
              has prevented pure metallofullerenes from being commercially available_making
              research on industrial applications of metallofullerenes economically
              infeasible to date. Development of a relatively inexpensive electrochemical
              purification process that could be scaled to much larger capactities would help
              spur the development of industrial applications for metallofullerenes in such
              fields as superconductors, electronics, nonlinear optics, and pharmaceuticals.
              During Phase I, the feasibility of electrochemical purification of
              metallofullerenes will be determined, with further optimization and scale-up of
              this process planned for Phase II.
