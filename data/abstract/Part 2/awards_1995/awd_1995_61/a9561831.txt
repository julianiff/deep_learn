Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study
              in-situ measurements of the global stratosphere which are needed to quantify
              long-term changes, to improve the observations and parameteorization on which
              global numerical models are based, and to calibrate/validate indirect probing
              methods from ground or satellite sensors. Radiosondes routinely and
              inexpensively monitor the stratosphere, but provide only limited information;
              research aircraft, at great expense, operate sporadically and cannot reach the
              upper stratosphere. BLAG (Balloon Launched Autonomous Glider) expands on the
              radiosonde concept, and on the 1965 development by MacCready of the automatic
              homing miniature glider, with the aid of modem technology -- especially GPS
              navigation; miniaturization of sensors for turbulence, water vapor, and other
              parameters; and advanced aerodynamics and structures. The small instrument
              package is raised by balloon; it descends as a glider, covering substantial
              traverse distances, and lands at a pre-designated spot.       The economic
              potential is to sell, and continually upgrade, these sophisticated BLAG systems
              that could substitute for (and expand the usefulness of) a large percentage of
              radiosondes. The approach is consistent with the AV motto of `doing more with
              less` BLAG will provide vital information that is at unobtainable in spite of
              giant past and planned investments in high altitude research aircraft programs.
