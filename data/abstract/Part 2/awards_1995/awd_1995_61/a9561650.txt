Abstract    :
              9561650  Rice    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a new process for depositing and patterning RuO2 contacts for use
              in ferroelectric thin film capacitor memory devices such as non-volatile
              memories (NVRAMs) and ultra-high density dynamic random access memories
              (DRAMs).  RuO2 has been shown to form a good contact with ferroelectric films
              such as PZT (PbZr1-xTixO3); this leads to substantially lower fatigue, better
              I-V characteristics, and improved time-dependent breakdown properties compared
              to PZT devices having metal contacts such as Pt.  However, the lack of a
              convenient processing technology has impeded the implementation of RuO2
              contacts in practical devices.  The new process incorporates two key
              innovations: first, the RuO2 films will be deposited as metallorganic
              precursors by a spin-on process, and patterned by wet chemical methods before
              firing.  This will enable a simpler, less damaging, and less expensive process
              than plasma etching, which is the only current method in use for patterning
              RuO2.  Second, the metallorganic precursor will possess organic groups which
              are photochemical crosslinkable.  The process will allow photolithographic
              patterning of the conductive oxide contact without requiring the use of a
              separate resist, thus saving process steps.  Phase I will develop soluble
              precursors to RuO2 having organic substituents capable of UV crosslinking,
              deposit these materials on substrates by a spin-on process, demonstrate
              photolithographic patterning, and assess the quality of fired RuO2 contacts. 
              This development will enable the practical fabrication of advanced
              ferroelectric thin film devices with superior performance compared to the
              current state-of-the-art.    Commercial applications of the proposed technology
              include non-volatile memories for smart cards and pagers, and gigabit-scale
              DRAMs for computer applications.
