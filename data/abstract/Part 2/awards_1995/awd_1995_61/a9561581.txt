Abstract    :
              ***  9561581  Wu         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is to study the feasibility of the development of a 600MHz wide bore (89mm)
              high resolution NMR magnet with internal tin superconducting wires.  Replacing
              bronze-processed wire by internal tin wire, high field NMR system cost will be
              reduced significantly.  The Phase I research objective is to solve engineering
              problems related to construction of high field NMR magnets with internal tin
              wire.  To achieve the objectives, Cryomagnetics, Inc. will develop model coils
              to experimentally determine the internal tin wire stability in persistent mode
              operation.  Phase I research will include fabrication of NbTi and Nb3Sn joints,
              analysis of stress distribution in the coils, optimization of the annealing
              process, design of quench protection circuits and evaluation of internal tin
              coil stability in persistent mode.   At the end of Phase I, an engineering
              design of a full scale 600 MHz wide bore NMR magnet will be completed, and this
              design will be the starting point for Phase II research which will be directed
              toward development of a full scale NMR magnet with internal tin wire.  The
              anticipated results from Phase I are to demonstrate the stability of internal
              tin wire in persistent mode operation and apply internal tin wire to high field
              NMR magnets.       The new technologies developed in Phase I will generate
              great commercial opportunities by reducing NMR system costs.  The proposed wide
              bore NMR magnet systems will be ideal for micro imaging and in vivo
              spectroscopy as well as biological solid state NMR spectroscopy.  The
              successful completion of Phase I & II of this project will make low price, wide
              bore, high field NMR magnets available in the market.  ***
