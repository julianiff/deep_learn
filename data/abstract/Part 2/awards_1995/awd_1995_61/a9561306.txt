Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study
              and design a tunable infrared source.  For many years, spectroscopists have
              depended heavily on tunable dye lasers and harmonic generators to explore
              molecular reactions and compounds by their characteristic spectra in the
              visible and ultraviolet (UV) wavelength regions.  More recently, solid state
              parametric oscillators have become indispensible tools in the UV, visible, and
              near-infrared (IR).  Compared to these wavelength regions, the mid-IR region of
              4 to 12 microns is relatively unexplored.  Although the mid-IR is rich in
              rotational/vibrational spectra for molecules, there are no commercial,
              coherent, tunable mid-IR sources available for spectroscopy.  Phase I will
              develop this important system in a design based on pumping with an Nd:YAG
              laser, which is a common type of laser in spectroscopy laboratories.  Phase II
              would build a prototype mid-IR laser with features conducive to the laboratory
              environment, including computer control of the device.       A tunable mid-IR
              source would be used widely in environmental monitoring, chemical and
              pharmaceutical research, microelectronics manufacturing, and combustion
              research for the automotive and defense industries.
