Abstract    :
              9561467  Cha     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              investigate the technical and economic feasibility of a novel approach for
              dramatically reducing the costs of removing various pollutants from the exhaust
              of stationary diesel engines. The proposed process specifically addresses those
              engines that drive electrical generators producing electrical power of 50 kW or
              more. Targeted pollutants include nitric oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HCs),
              carbon monoxide (CO), and soot (also known as dry particulate material, or
              DPM). The proposed approach entails injecting a very small amount of hexane
              into the diesel exhaust at the exit of the engine manifold. The altered mixture
              of gases then passes through a triple-layered, catalyst-impregnated filter that
              is subjected to low-level microwave energy. The first layer of the filter
              captures the DPM which oxidizes rapidly in the presence of microwave energy.
              The second layer_impregnated with copper (Cu) and gadolinium (Gd)
              catalysts_promotes the reduction of NOx in the presence of hexane and other
              hydrocarbons in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. The third layer utilizes an
              oxidizing catalyst to promote the complete conversion of CO and HCs, including
              any surviving hexane, to CO2. In addition to driving the oxidation of captured
              DPM in the first layer of the filter, subjecting the filter to low-level
              microwave energy enhances the catalytic reactions in the second and third
              layers of the filter to achieve very high conversions of NOx, HCs, and CO.  
              Successful completion of Phase I could potentially yield a process that would
              cost effectively remove ninety percent (90%) of the NOx and all of the DPM, CO,
              and HC found in the exhaust of 50+ kW diesel engines used in stationary power
              applications.
