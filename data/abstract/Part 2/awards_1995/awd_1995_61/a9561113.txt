Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will illustrate the
              relative and absolute importance of materials and process hardening on the
              superconducting performance and microstructure of Bi-2223 composite tape using
              a fundamental approach and a simple conceptual framework. Commercially viable
              high-temperature superconductor (HTS) wire must have high Jc performance and
              low cost. This project will develop a novel deformation processing scheme. If
              successful, this firm will produce an innovative deformation process that
              provides the benefits of pressing while maintaining the cost advantages of
              rolling.   Successful completion of this project will have broad impact on all
              HTS conductor applications, and especially those that require long and
              continuous lengths with high Jc performance. HTS applications have a
              multi-billion dollar market potential in products integral to electric power
              generation, distribution, transportation, machinery, energy storage and other
              uses for both military and commercial systems. Specific HTS systems and
              components include power transmission cables, motors, generators, fault current
              limiters, and transformers.
