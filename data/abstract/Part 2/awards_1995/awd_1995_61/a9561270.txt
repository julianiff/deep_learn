Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              demonstrate the transport of dry unipolar toner with electrostatic traveling
              waves in a manner required for use in advanced forms of color laser printing
              and direct powder printing.  An earlier form of traveling wave device, known as
              the `electric curtain,` transports toner too slowly for the desired use. 
              Another form, known as the `charged toner conveyor,` transports toner too fast.
               However, a new way of operating a traveling wave conveyor has recently been
              discovered, in which toner speed can be controlled to achieve exactly the range
              desired.  A non-interactive, unipolar (NU) development process can convey toner
              past electrostatic latent images in the manner sought.  During Phase I,
              traveling wave conveyors will be constructed and demonstrated to transport
              toner over the favorably predicted speed range.  During Phase II,
              NU-development systems would be developed for two general types of
              applications: simplified color laser printers; and direct powder printers.  In
              terms of developer performance, the only significant difference in these
              applications is the required toner speed.  System architectures will depend on
              specific applications.       This technology is expected to find commercial
              appication in simpler, lower cost color laser printers, which can be more
              competitive with printers based on liquid ink jet technology.  Such printers
              would provide better quality prints at higher speed.  Further, this technology
              would be the basis for direct powder printers with great simplicity,
              reliability, low cost, and continuous-tone color capability, eventually
              enabling a digital photo-printer with better quality/price ratio than can be
              achieved by other technologies.
