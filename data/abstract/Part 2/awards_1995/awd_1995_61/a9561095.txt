Abstract    :
              9561095  Linden         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project develops a new, wavelength-multiplexed, monolithic semiconductor laser
              array for use in a spectrometer capable of simultaneous detection of a variety
              of gases in absolute trace concentrations.  Simultaneous, multitrace gas
              detection is presently  possible only with complex and very expensive
              multilaser systems or with FTIR instruments which do not have trace gas
              sensitivities approaching those demonstrated by tunable diode laser
              spectrometers.  The recent (1994) discovery and demonstration of the quantum
              cascade laser (an unipolar, mid-IR, semiconductor laser) enables a completely
              new manufacturable, junction-free semiconductor laser source, which can be
              multiplexed over a large number of preselected wavelength regions in the
              mid-IR.  Such a tunable, multiwavelength laser source can simultaneously sense
              traces of a large variety of gases in the atmosphere.       This research will
              design, develop, and demonstrate a monolithic, addressable, multiwavelength
              tunable, quantum cascade laser array for gas and trace gas detection.  Phase II
              would look at epitaxial growth of complex quantum well laser structures, laser
              array fabrication, evaluation, spectrometer system design, and prototype
              evaluation.  It is anticipated that this research will produce a portable,
              ultra-high sensitivity, multigas, mid-IR spectrometer.  Potential commercial
              applications include simultaneous trace gas detection of a wide variety of
              atmospheric pollutants, hazardous gaseous species, explosive decomposition
              products, and biological agents.  Such an instrument can also be used for
              chemical process monitoring, studies of complex chemical kinetics, medical
              diagnostics, and environmental surveillance.
