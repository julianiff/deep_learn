Abstract    :
              9561221  Biter    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for
              computer interfaces, practical finger and hand force sensors which are
              necessary to provide force feedback control for positioning cursors,
              manipulating objects, etc. since they transmit the user's hand and finger
              motion. Other applications range from medical applications to robotics,
              advanced manufacturing and virtual reality simulation; any man-machine
              interaction where accurate positioning is required.  Existing sensors can not
              satisfy these needs.  The sensors cannot be used in an array and are pressure
              sensors and cannot measure shear forces.  The proposed sensor array being
              developed can meet most of the requirement for a tactile array. It uses a
              magnetoelectric film with a resolution that could exceed 20 elements/inch. The
              sensor array under development is a totally new approach to a sensor system. 
              It measures the strain in a magnetrostrictive film by the coupling between the
              magnetic field and the magnetoelectric element.The output is an amplitude
              modulated signal with good dc response and high sensitivity. It can also
              measure shear forces but the most interesting property is the ability to matrix
              address the array and actually measure all elements simultaneously.    The
              phase I program will design, fabricate and test a sensor array suitable for the
              tactile interfaces to a computer. The magnetoelectric material is a new
              material which can be used in arrays, including ultrasonic imagers, sonar
              arrays, pressure mats, etc.  The proposed tactile interface will have wide use
              in systems that require feedback from hand motion, including robotics, smart
              manufacturing and numerous medical/diagnostic applications as well as computer
              interfaces.
