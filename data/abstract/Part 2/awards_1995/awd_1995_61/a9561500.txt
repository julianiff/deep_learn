Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project develops
              techniques for solving complex stochastic control problems using neuro-dynamic
              programming (NDP).  Although stochastic control problems are critical in many
              applications, satisfactory solutions have not been found because of their great
              complexity.  However, recent advances in NDP may enable solutions to stochastic
              control problems that were once dismissed as intractable.  Phase I will develop
              a methodological framework for the application of NDP and apply the technology
              to a complex real-world stochastic control problem of commercial interest,
              namely, supply chain management.  This approach exploits all information that
              is critical for optimal control and is expected to lead to a realistic modeling
              of a generic supply-chain.  It is expected to surpass existing strategies for
              stochastic control, and a rigorous comparison will be made to establish NDP as
              an important and practical technology.        After Phase I a user-friendly
              commercial software product can be developed to enable the widespread
              application of neuro-dynamic programming.  Furthermore, strategies developed
              from the case study in supply-chain management would be integrated into
              existing commercial supply-chain management software and marketed to
              manufacturing companies.
