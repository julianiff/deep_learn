Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project is focused on the
              development of economically and environmentally advantageous solid acid
              catalysts for the gasoline alkylation process; a process whereby alkylate is
              generated by the reaction of butenes with isobutane to generate a highly
              branched C8 hydrocarbon. Alkylate, comprises over 12% of the gasoline pool and
              is one of best components of gasoline having high octane, low volatility, and
              clean burning characteristics. Consequently, demand is growing for this
              material. The strategy of this research will be to synthesize novel,
              non-volatile, easily separable solid acids with superacidic properties,
              characterize the materials and test then for alkylation acidity.   Currently,
              alkylate is generated in acid catalyzed processes utilizing liquid sulfuric or
              liquid hydrofluoric acids. At any time, a typical plant sulfuric acid plant
              utilizes 2.5 million pounds of sulfuric acid while a hydrofluoric acid plant
              utilizes 200,000 pounds of this material. Particularly in the case of the
              volatile, highly toxic, hydrofluoric acid, these large quantities of toxic
              acids pose significant health and environmental issue. Additionally, these
              acids require frequent regeneration. In the case of sulfuric acid, a typical
              plant will generate 100 tons/day of spent acid that requires regeneration.  
              The replacement of these liquid acids with non-volatile, easily separated solid
              acid catalysts would provide refiners with a more economic option for producing
              high octane reformulated gasoline reduce the environmental problems associated
              with current processes. It is anticipated that the development of effective
              solid acid catalysts would have broad implication for the process industry as
              many industrial processes utilize acid catalysts.
