Abstract    :
                9561810  Wojtowicz         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project addresses the problem of removal and recovery of mercury from
              combustion/incineration flue gas with concurrent control of SO2 and NOX. Coal
              combustion and incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes result in air
              pollution due to emissions of trace amounts of heavy metals. Because of high
              toxicity of these species, their emissions are or will be regulated. High
              volatility of mercury makes control of this metal particularly difficult. The
              project approach is based on regenerative adsorption on novel sorbents. A
              proprietary adsorption/stripping/regeneration scheme is used, with mercury
              recovery downstream of the regenerator. The preferred location for the
              adsorption unit is directly before the stack, which makes retrofitting an
              easier task, and also makes it possible to carry out adsorption at relatively
              low temperatures (70 to 200  degrees C). The success of the project hinges upon
              the proof of sorbent performance, which is the objective of the Phase I
              research. To date, no technology is available for mercury removal from
              combustion/incineration gases. The objective of the Phase I project is to
              demonstrate (1) high mercury removal efficiencies; and (2) the technical and
              economic feasibility of the proposed process. The project will be carried out
              in three tasks: (1) selection and preparation of sorbents; (2) assembling and
              testing the experimental set-up; and (3) sorption/regeneration experiments.    
                The main result of this research will be a novel technology for the removal
              of mercury from combustion flue gas, with simultaneous reduction in SO2 and NOX
              levels. Future extension of this process to other pollutants (e.g., other
              volatile air toxics, N2O, etc.) is also possible.  Applications for the process
              include: coal fired power plants as well as municipal, medical, and hazardous
              waste incinerators.
