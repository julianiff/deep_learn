Abstract    :
              9561823  Daughton         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate how narrow width (0.1-0.3 micron) stripes of Giant
              Magnetoresistance multilayers can form new magnetic structures, which look
              promising for magnetic field sensors and for tape and disk read heads.  Initial
              data on these narrow stripes show two magnetic states, each of which gives
              linear changes in stripe resistance with applied magnetic fields, but with
              opposite polarities.  This magnetic structure results from a number of magnetic
              characteristics, including bilinear and biquadratic exchange between magnetic
              layers, exchange coupling within magnetic layers, magnetostatic energy, and
              crystalline and field-induced anisotropies.  The magnetic configuration
              improves sensitivity by compensating anti-ferromagnetic coupling with size
              effects in the nanometer scale stripes, and improves noise characteristics by
              utilizing single domain devices.       In Phase I a computer model will be
              developed to predict the magnetoresistance behavior of the stripes as a
              function of line width and material parameters.  A hybrid sensor assembly will
              be fabricated and characterized using these narrow stripes, and a read head
              will be designed for very narrow track widths.  In Phase II a monolithic sensor
              and a narrow track read head will be demonstrated.  Commercial applications
              include high sensitivity magnetic field sensors for medical, industrial, and
              automotive sectors and read heads for very high density disk and tape drives.
