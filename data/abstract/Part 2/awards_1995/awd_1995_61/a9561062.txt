Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project combines
              high-brightness semiconductor diode laser arrays and novel
              brightness-conserving optics in a hundred-watt to kilowatt laser machining
              system.  The performance of such a system is expected to approximate that of
              conventional carbon dioxide and YAG-based systems but at a fraction of the
              cost, size, and power.  Laser machining is a rapidly expanding in industrial
              materials processing, but the size, cost, and efficiency of present systems
              limit their use.  By combining recent order-of-magnitude improvements in diode
              laser brightness with novel beam-combining concepts, a low-cost architecture
              could be scaled for various laser cutting, welding, and selective surface
              treatment applications.       The proposed laser machining system is expected
              to reduce the cost of laser machining and will therefore expand its role
              throughout the U.S. automotive, aerospace, and metalworking industries.  This
              technology will enhance U.S. competitiveness across the manufacturing sector.
