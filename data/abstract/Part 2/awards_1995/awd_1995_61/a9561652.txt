Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on
              developing pH sensors that are thermally robust (stable over 100 +C) for
              geochemical and environmental applications. Existing pH sensors are of glass
              electrode design and are widely used for process control and research
              applications. Despite their simplicity, rapid and stable Nerstian reponse, the
              glass electrode pH sensors exhibit acid and alkali errors, sensitivity to
              monovalent cations, mechanical fragility, undesirable impedance, and
              instability at high temperatures (> 100 +C). These characteristics seriously
              impair the use of commercially available pH sensors in a wide range of
              applications, and geochemical and environmental applications in particular.  it
              is proposed to demonstrate a pH sensor based on nanostructured materials that
              overcomes these limitations and is economical.  Proof-of-concept of the sensori
              is expected to be established during Phase I, optimization and field testing of
              the sensor with lead customers during Phase II, and commercialization of the
              sensor to niche markets during Phase III.       The proposed pH sensor would
              assist earth and geological studies and enable efficient and reliable operation
              of caustic scrubbers for acid gases, detoxifiers of chromates, boilers in
              utility plants . The improved sensor would help explore geological reserves,
              conserve raw materials, improve the environment, and help produce safer and
              reliable products.
