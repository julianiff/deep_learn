Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will address sintering
              of `binderless` Nanocrystalline Diamond Compacts (NDCs). Sintering will be
              performed using an advanced high pressure/high temperature synthesis method
              with capabilities of 15 GPa at 1800 oK. Currently. Polycrystalline Diamond
              Compacts (PDCs) are produced commercially from 20-70 micron size diamond powder
              by high pressure compaction methods, using metal binders (Co, Si Ni). Use of
              the metal binder reduces the thermal stability of the compacts, while use of
              large diamond powder particles reduces the toughness and ductility. This limits
              the applications for the PDCs.   This project will develop an economical method
              for fabricating Nanocrystalline Diamond Compacts (NDCs), without any binder
              from < 5 nm diamond particle powders. The hardness and toughness of the
              material should match those of naturally formed polycrystalline diamond -
              `carbonado`. The ultra-fine grained diamond compacts are candidate materials
              for precision manufacturing tools, which can be used for high rate machining
              and fabrication of hard materials. The project will demonstrate the feasibility
              of producing test samples of NDCs using highly purified nano-diamond powder as
              starting material, and our in-house ultrahigh pressure unit for powder
              compaction purposes. This project will determine the physical and mechanical
              properties of the NDC samples.   Routine production of large volumes of
              binderless nanocrystalline diamond compacts will significantly improve the high
              temperature stability and precision performance of cutting tools.
