Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate the use of in-situ, real-time film thickness monitoring and
              in-situ, real-time uniformity manipulation to improve process uniformity of
              Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP).  Improved process uniformity will enhance
              the yield and effectiveness of the CMP process, which is increasingly used as a
              semiconductor planarization process.  Phase I will develop a five-channel,
              real-time CMP active uniformity control system capable of compensating for
              center uniformity defects.  Individual components will include:
              opto-electronics, software, five-channel optic access, and a back pressure
              system.       Commercial application of the technology will focus on the CMP
              process used in semiconductor manufacturing.  In addition, other potential
              applications include micromachining and optical circuit and fine optics
              production.
