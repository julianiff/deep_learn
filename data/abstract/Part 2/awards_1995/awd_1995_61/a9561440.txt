Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              address a novel approach for improving the efficiency of net shape forming
              operations.  In particular, it would benefit Powder Metal (PM) processing in
              the costly area of post finishing operations for PM parts.  These operations
              contribute significantly to the overall part cost.  Elimination or reduction of
              post finishing operations would have a significant impact on PM processing
              economics.  Phase I will develop a process based on the application of electric
              field energy to enhance the surface finish of PM parts during the sintering
              operation.  The technique appears to improve surface finish by reducing surface
              porosity.  The Phase I effort will focus on determining the optimum conditions
              under which Electric Field Sintering (EFS) can improve PM surface finishes.    
                Commercial application of EFS equipment focuses on PM sintering operations by
              metal powder and parts producers.  In addition, manufacture of high performance
              transmission gears is one of several other fields of potential application.
