Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              provide a basic understanding of a new machining process called Electrochemical
              Orbital Abrading (ECOA).  Advanced materials, such as high temperature metal
              matrix composites, have properties affording advantageous performance
              parameters but which are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to machine. 
              The ECOA machining process combines several materials removal processes to
              achieve a viable, economic machining technology for complex shapes and advanced
              materials.  Phase I will determine feasibility of the ECOA process as measured
              by dimensional accuracy, surface integrity assessments,and surface finish
              measurements.  Research will focus on basic factors which influence ECOA. 
              Electrolyte, tooling, and process parameters will be optimized, and the effort
              will examine more complex configurations.  The electrochemical removal
              mechanism, electrochemical grinding characteristics, and the orbital abrasion
              action will be investigated in a combined configuration to establish
              feasibility of maintaining a balance among these actions.       By virtue of
              anticipated advantages in fast, low-stock removal with excellent surface finish
              and integrity, ECOA is expected to find applications for a very broad cross
              section of traditional materials and configurations as generic as tool and
              diemaking for casting, forging, stamping, plastic molding, etc.  An important
              application is machining of advanced materials in industries such as advanced
              propulsion engines where serious machining problems are likely to emerge with
              advanced materials.
