Abstract    :
              9561625  Naqwi       The purpose of this Small Businness Innovation Research
              (SBIR) Phase I project is to examine the feasibility of extending the
              interferometric phase Doppler technique to irregular particles. Phase shift
              signals generated by the irregular particles will be interpreted as the outcome
              of a stochastic process, i.e. a given particle (depending upon its orientation
              in the measurement volume) is expected to generate a particular phase shift
              with a certain probability. This project aims at experimentally examining the
              nature of the phase shift probability functions, associated with different kind
              of irregular and inhomogeneous particles (preliminary measurements indicate
              that these functions may be fairly simple in form). For this purpose, irregular
              particles will be qualified using alternative techniques that measure particle
              volume, cross-sectional area or aerodynamic diameter. The theory of geometrical
              scattering by statistically random particles will also be developed to predict
              the above probability functions. Finally, numerical inversion schemes will be
              developed to deduce velocity-resolved particle size distributions from the
              measured phase shift distributions.       The successful completion of Phase
              II, if approved, will lead to a very desirable technique for non-intrusive and
              spatially-resolved measurement of irregular particles in multiphase flows.
              Measurements would be conducted through a single optical window and would be
              independent of laser intensity. Currently, there is no equivalent commercial or
              non-commercial instrument available.
