Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets the
              creation of enhanced strains of algae for the production of stable isotope
              biochemicals.  Tools developed in the project can then be extended to generate
              improved algal strains for manufacturing vitamins, oils, fuels, foods, and
              pharmaceuticals.  Phycotechnology, the application of biotechnology to improve
              algae-based systems, has great potential but is still in its infancy.  This
              research will make it possible to develop new strains of algae of commercial
              interest that cannot be produced by standard genetic crosses.  The feasibility
              of making hybrid algae strains that maintain the combined properties of the two
              parental strains that would not otherwise hybridize will be demonstrated.      
              The technology developed here to produce new strains of commercial algae will
              be applied to lower the costs of production for algal derived stable isotopes
              and increase the variety of economically feasible compounds.  Also, the
              enhanced strains will be licensed to industry and academia for use in
              aquaculture, energy production, nutritional supplements and elsewhere.
