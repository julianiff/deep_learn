Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              examine the fabrication of rotary engine parts using carbon-carbon (C-C)
              composite materials.  The innovative rotary engine for which these parts will
              be designed operates on what is known as the `true Diesel` compression ignition
              cycle.  Successful adaptation of these C-C components will result in this
              engine not only being more compact, significantly lighter in weight, quieter
              and more fuel efficient, but also costing less than presently available piston
              or Wankel type engines.  Finite element thermal and stress analysis of these
              parts will be done after the operating conditions of the engine have been
              analyzed.  Phase II would concentrate on further development with strategic
              partners.       Potential commercial applications for C-C composites include
              wear and corrosion resistant capacitors in battery and combustion components,
              bearings, gears, shafts, nozzles, crucibles, high temperature alloy production,
              high temperature tape and wire drawing dies, sensors, read-write heads in
              computers, brushes in electric motors, and superior thermal management devices
              for microelectronics.  The rotary engine has numerous applications in power,
              refrigeration, helicopter, and materials handling industries and is a global
              market due to high horsepower per unit weight.
