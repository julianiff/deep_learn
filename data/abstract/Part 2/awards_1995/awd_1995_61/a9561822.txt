Abstract    :
              9561822  Leo         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will experimentally validate a technique for dynamic analysis of structures
              with very high modal density acted on by uncertain loads.  The primary tools
              for dynamic analysis are finite element modeling, modal analysis, and
              statistical energy analysis.  These methods are powerful tools but have
              limitations when applied to extremely complex structural systems.  A technique
              known as admittance modeling has the potential to overcome these limitations,
              but has not been thoroughly tested on practical problems.  The goal of this
              effort is to develop this promising theory into a practical tool for the
              analysis of very complex structural systems.  Two experiments will be performed
              during Phase I.  The first involves the control of a truss structure with an
              attached tuned-mass damper.  The second experiment is a vibroacoustic system
              consisting of a "black box" attached to a stiffened panel that is excited by
              multiple acoustic sources.  For both experiments, dynamic response will be
              predicted using experimental measurements and the admittance modeling
              technique.  The accuracy of the admittance technique will be tested by
              comparing the predicted responses with the measured data of the actual system. 
              A preliminary software package will also be developed to analyze the
              experimental data and provide a basis for the full-scale development in Phase
              II.       A fully developed admittance modeling package would fill an important
              gap in the toolbox of structural dynamicists.  A commercially available package
              would be of interest in the aircraft and automotive industries because of the
              inherent complexity of their structural vibration problems.
