Abstract    :
                95-61066  Pan     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate the economic separation/purification of fullerenes (C60, C70)
              without the use of solvents. Fullerenes, the third form of carbon after
              graphite and diamond, have ushered in a completely new field of carbon with
              potential applications in diverse fields such as electronics, medicine,
              materials, and chemistry. The continued research as well as the pace of
              large-scale application development are hampered, however, by the high cost
              (several times the cost of gold) and limited supply of pure and solvent-free
              fullerenes which are currently separated by liquid chromatography. Residue
              solvents in the fullerenes are impurities that often significantly interfere
              with applications of interest. A major contributor to the high cost is the
              separation/purification cost primarily arising from the difficulty in
              completely removing the residue solvent. This program will demonstrate a
              continuous, energy integrated separation method that utilizes the difference in
              the volatility of C60 and C7O and incorporates a fluidized bed technique into
              the separation.   The results of this program will immediately bolster
              fullerene research and advance the efforts to develop a commercial
              manufacturing process for low-cost, pure, and solvent-free fullerenes. Such a
              commercial process will lead to large scale applications of fullerenes in
              optics, high temperature superconductivity, catalyst, polymers, medicine,
              diamond synthesis, and a host of other diverse applications.
