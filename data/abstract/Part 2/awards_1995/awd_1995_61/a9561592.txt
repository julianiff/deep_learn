Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research project is for a novel radiation
              detector which has the potential to provide the commercial sector and
              government with a simple, low cost, room temperature radiation detector with
              extremely high energy resolution. The detector requires no cryogenic cooling,
              is planned to be extremely rugged and provide efficient and accurate
              identification of x-rays and gamma-rays from 50keV to lOMeV.  It will have an
              intrinsic energy resolution far superior to any scintillation detector
              currently available and will approach that of cryogenically cooled germanium.
              The researchers at SenTor have been investigating highly purified xenon gas
              near the critical point as a room temperature detection medium.  Xenon gas in
              this thermodynamic regime has proven to be ideally suited for room temperature
              radiation detection.  An xenon ionization chamber detector constructed in a
              cylindrical geometry provides the additional opportunity to perform Compton
              suppression through pulse shape discrimination.       A cylindrical ionization
              chamber xenon x-ray/gamma-ray detector represents a significant advancement in
              high resolution, room temperature radiation detection and could be used in such
              diverse applications as treaty verification, hazardous waste monitoring, deep
              well logging, x-ray and gamma-ray astrophysics and medical diagnostics.
