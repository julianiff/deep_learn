Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) fuel cells for applications with the Next
              Generation of Vehicles (NGV).  These fuel cells hold promise of providing power
              at high energy efficiencies and low pollutant emission rates.  Long-term
              durability, quiet operation, and modular design are other desirable properties
              that will also be required in NGV power supplies       This research explores
              the possibilities of an improved SPE for hydrocarbon/air fuel cells  The
              project will involve preparation and characterization of a novel form of
              perfluorinated acid membranes and will demonstrate high temperature operation
              of SPE fuel cells.       An improved high-temperature SPE fuel cell could mean
              that portable fuel cells may run on unrefined fuels such as methanol and
              propane.  This would contribute to practical fuel cell designs for automotive
              and other portable power applications.
