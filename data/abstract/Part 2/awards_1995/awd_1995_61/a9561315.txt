Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project probes a
              variation geometric modeling and analysis framework based on concepts embodied
              in finite element analysis.  A procedural interpretation of geometric
              dimensioning and tolerance information is formed as the stiffness matrix, loads
              and material properties in order to create feature variation in size, position,
              orientation, and form.  The goal is to provide a standardized mathematical
              basis for comprehensive, three-dimensional tolerance analysis.  The inclusion
              of structural deformations, thermal expansion, the discretized synergy with
              coordinate measuring systems, the embodiment of robust design, and its
              intuitive conceptual appeal is expected to advance the field of variation
              dimensional management and simultaneous engineering.   This innovation will
              enable the engineering of three-dimensional objects (virtual parts) for optimal
              tolerance allocation.  Commercial applications are anticipated in many
              manufacturing functions, including robust product design, simultaneous
              engineering, rapid prototyping, cost reduction and quality enhancement,
              computer aided tolerance analysis, and optimization for the design and
              manufacture of mechanical and electrical systems.
