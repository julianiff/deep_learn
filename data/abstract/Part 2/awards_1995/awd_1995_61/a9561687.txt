Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a
              polarization independent wavelength routing switch for wideband fiber optic
              communication. The enormous potential of all-optical network for wide area
              telecommunication has stimulated considerable research on the supporting
              optical device technologies. At the core of the wavelength division
              multiplexing (WDM) based optical network is a crossconnect switch for routing a
              larger number of wavelength channels. The acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF)
              has shown to be the most promising candidate for the wavelength routing switch
              due to its unique capability of routing many wavelengths simultaneously and
              independently. Present technology of this key device, however, has basic
              performance limitations that include limited resolution, unacceptable crosstalk
              and high insertion loss. Aurora Associates proposes a new type of polarization
              independent (PI) AOTF. The novel concept adds greater flexibility in the
              selection of materials and device design and offers the potential of overcoming
              all of the deficiencies of present AOTF technology. During Phase I, a
              feasibility model will be built to prove the principle of the new PI AOTF and
              show its potential for WDM switch applications. Projected key performance of
              the feasibility model PI AOTF include 1 nm bandwidth at 1550 nm and sidelobes
              below -30 dB.       The new AOTF described in this proposal can be used in a
              wide range of commercial applications: multiplexing fiber optic sensor, tuning
              of laser, fiber optic spectrometer, and most importantly, the WDM cross-connect
              switch - the key device in an all-optical networks for wide area
              telecommunication.
