Abstract    :
              9561298  Rabinovich   The ultimate product of this Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project is a module for training adolescent drivers
              appropriate skills of risk perception and evaluation incorporating the features
              that have been lacking in failed past attempts; namely, (a) direct relationship
              to current research and theory on adolescent cognition and risk behavior; (b)
              adoption of successful strategies from other domains of youthful risk behavior
              (e.g., drugs, violence, sexual behavior); and (c) flexibility to adapt to the
              current driver education system which is now diverse, often informal, and
              conducted within non-educational as well as various educational settings.  The
              aim of this Phase I effort is to provide basic information about how youth
              evaluate risks in different traffic situations in the laboratory and on the
              road; identify strategies utilized in successful prevention/intervention
              programs for risky behavior (e.g., driving, substance use, etc.); and develop
              guidelines for a modular risk decision component of driver training.  The
              modular unit will contain transportable low-tech training that can be used in a
              variety of settings (e.g., school, home, commercial driver training
              establishments, community sites, and testing sites).  This information will be
              utilized to achieve the major goal of the next phase of the project which will
              produce a training module for young novice drivers.   The proposed product has
              commercial application for training young novice drivers to perceive risky
              traffic situations.  It would have applicability to a variety of settings
              including high school health classes, commercial driver training, and community
              settings.
