Abstract    :
              9561674  Jackiw     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              establishes the groundwork for the development of interactive and exploratory
              geometry-learning software realized on inexpensive, pen-based, and handheld
              computers.  The research draws on Key Curriculum Press's existing dynamic
              geometry software--The Geometer's Sketchpad--and on the accessibility afforded
              by handheld technology (currently in the form of "graphing calculators").  The
              proposed research will develop classroom scenarios of pen-based devices used in
              classrooms, taking into account possibilities for interaction with
              desktop-based computers.  These scenarios will be used to develop algorithms
              for pen-based geometry input, prototypes of a pen-based Sketchpad product, and
              specifications for a minimal hardware platform for launching this new
              technology in a mathematics education context.   The Geometer's Sketchpad
              enjoys a position as a well regarded and commercially successful educational
              software system.  The proposed project, led by Sketchpad's original author and
              ongoing project director, will pave the way for migrating this software to a
              new and promising hardware platform on the horizon of educational technology. 
              The project has outstanding potential for commercial success in school markets
              because it represents an environment which is educationally sound (in that it
              draws on the existing Sketchpad), widely accessible (in that it is both
              portable and inexpensive), and ideally suited for exploring mathematics
              (because it is pen-based).
