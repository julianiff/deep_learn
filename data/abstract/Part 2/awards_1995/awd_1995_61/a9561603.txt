Abstract    :
              9561603  Gadhok     Throughout the United States, teachers and students with
              disabilities encounter difficulties which undermine teacher-student
              communication and preclude optimal learning.  This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will generate the technical data for the development
              of an automated note-taking and multimedia lecture delivery system based on a
              patented electro-optical sensing and scanning technology.  The system will
              enable mobility-impaired teachers to overcome many of the instructional
              problems imposed by physical limitations and will enhance and facilitate the
              learning experience for students with physical and learning disabilities.  The
              basic goals of the Phase I project are to produce a prototype automated
              note-taking system and to establish the parameters for the multimedia lecture
              delivery system, which will be fully developed in the next phase of the
              research.  The research and development effort in Phase I will focus on the
              evaluation of the technologies required to adapt the digitization technology
              established by Digital Scanning Systems, Inc. for the development of an
              automated note-taking and multimedia lecture delivery system so that it will be
              of particular benefit to the disabled community both within and outside of the
              education environment.   The automated note-taking and multimedia lecture
              delivery system will be marketed for use by the disabled community in
              education, as well as for use in business and other noneducational
              environments.  There are numerous other applications for the technology which
              can be utilized by individuals who are not disabled as well as those who are. 
              These applications include the following:  Producing hardcopy (printouts) from
              whiteboards; automated note-taking in business and other conference rooms;
              teleconferencing; and the digitization of large-area design boards.
