Abstract    :
                9561291  Wang     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
              investigate the technical feasibility of using concentrated solar energy to
              continuously evaporate waste forms of carbon and establish the economic
              feasibility of producing fullerenes using the proposed solar-thermal process.
              Concentrated solar energy is an environmentally benign and novel method for
              achieving ultra-high heat fluxes. The proposed solar-thermal process would
              provide a pollution-free supply of energy for synthesis processes that require
              focused intense heat. The production of fullerenes (buckyballs) requires very
              high temperatures to vaporize carbon and condense C60, C70, and other complex
              carbon molecules. Fullerenes are currently produced using an electric arc
              between expensive graphite rods. This process is quite energy intensive and the
              electrical generation, graphite rod production and organic solvent extraction
              of the fullerenes associated with this process contribute to the production of
              waste. Concentrated solar energy is ideal for vaporizing a variety of forms of
              carbon_which is some cases is a waste product_for the synthesis of fullerenes.
              The feasibility of this process has been demonstrated on a batch basis and has
              the potential of being significantly more economical than the existing electric
              arc process.   The primary benefit of this Phase I project will be to establish
              an environmentally benign process of utilizing waste carbon and solar energy to
              economically produce fullerenes to meet the projected demand of fullerenes dor
              electrodes in hydride batteries, fuel cells, gas storage of hydrogen, oxygen
              and hydrocarbons and as precursors to deposit diamond.  The grantee is the
              largest producer of fullerenes and plans to scale production to one ton/day in
              1998 for an established application of fullerenes.
