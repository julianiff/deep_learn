Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate silicon carbide (SiC) on insulator technology, which is similar to
              that of silicon on insulator (SOI).  Interest is rapidly increasing in wide
              bandgap semiconductors for superior high frequency and high power electronics. 
              SiC is the most advanced wide bandgap semiconductor from a materials and device
              processing point of view.  However, many device applications, especially high
              frequency devices, require insulating or semi-insulating substrates for optimum
              performance.  However, there are currently no semi-insulating SiC substrates. 
              Phase I will develop a SiC on insulator, and instead of silicon dioxide (SiO2),
              aluminum nitride (AlN) will be used as the insulator.  AlN has a wide bandgap
              of 6.2 eV and is virtually insulating in its as-deposited form.  Another
              potential use for this material system is as an insulator in
              metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices as an alternate to SiO2 for use at
              high temperatures.  In Phase I this structure will be grown on a common
              hexagonal polytype (6H-SiC) substrates.  Phase II would further develop this
              technology and examlne transistor performance on these SiC on insulating
              substrates.       Commercial applications are expected in cost-effective and
              reproducible manufacture of high-performance, high-frequency devices using SiC
              on insulator technology.  AlN may also be a useful insulator for MIS structures
              which must operate at high temperatures.
