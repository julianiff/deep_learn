Abstract    :
              9561238  Putnam   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              develops an economic model and accompanying software with which to measure the
              dollar value of an arbitrary international patent portfolio.  The discrete
              choice to file a patent application in each of a set of foreign countries is
              held constant, and the cross-sectional variation in market size and the quality
              of patent protection is exploited to recover the underlying value distribution.
               Although this method is not without flaws, it possesses several advantages
              over the only other method that has been used to assign dollar values to the
              distribution, namely patent renewal models; for example, it generates ex ante
              value estimates of the worldwide return to patent protection, even for
              countries with zero renewal fees, rather than ex post estimates for a single
              country.  The principal focus of Phase I research is determining the
              feasibility of transferring this method to the level of the firm. After
              appropriate modifications to the model, it is to be tested in three contexts:
              (1) cross-sectionally, on four critical technology datasets from the l990s; (2)
              over time, on a set of pharmaceutical patents from the last 15 years; (3) in
              conjunction with firm-level total factor productivity estimates, employing a
              subset of the pharmaceutical data.   There are as many potential applications
              for this method as there are current uses of R&D input data and patent
              statistics.  Firm-level uses, which are the focus of this project include: 
              estimation of firm- and business unit-level productivity; valuation of patent
              portfolios for licensing, merger and acquisition, and securities analysis;
              strategic R&D management; competitive intelligence assessment; and policy
              analyses of international competitiveness.
