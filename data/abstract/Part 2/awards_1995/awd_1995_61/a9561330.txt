Abstract    :
              9561330  Moore         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is to develop a differential absorption meter optimized for frazil ice
              detection. Small crystals known as frazil ice form when heat is removed from a
              turbulent water body that is at, or below the freezing point. This process
              proves a major factor in ice formation of northern lakes and exposed polar
              oceanic bodies, and plays an important role in numerous physical and biological
              processes. In addition frazil ice formation can severely impact various
              cold-climate industrial water use processes. Yet the mechanism, it's
              prevalence, and the associated dynamics remain poorly understood, largely for
              lack of effective instrumentation. Researchers recently successfully tested a
              measurement technique in which the differential absorption of water and ice
              were determined to yield ice crystal concentration. This technique shows great
              promise in becoming an accepted method if an instrument can be developed to
              effectively exploit it. Phase I effort will focus upon the development and
              testing of a proof of principal prototype.       Commercial uses of the meter
              range from research applications to environmental and process monitoring.
              Potential customers include scientists, government agencies, hydroelectric
              power authorities, municipal water authorities, shipping companies and other
              industrial concerns.
