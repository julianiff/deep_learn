Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              develop thermosetting anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) that are optimum for 193
              nm optical lithography applications.  This is the most likely exposure
              wavelength for the generation of equipment that follows deep-UV (248 nm). 
              Since reflectivity coefficients at this shorter wavelength are similar or (in
              some instances) higher than those at 248 nm, a need for an ARC undeneath the
              193 nm resist can be expected.  The research objective of is to provide at
              least one outstanding or optimum 193-nm ARC for manufacturers to use during
              resist development and for the production of semiconductor devices.       Light
              absorbing chromaphore (193 nm) will be chemically-attached to three different
              polymer hosts.  The host polymers have been selected for high aliphatic content
              and the expectation that they will exhibit improved oxygen-plasma etch rates. 
              To assure insolubility in photoresist solvents, the dye-attached polymers will
              be formulated into thermosetting systems (ARCs).  The profile of 193 nm resist
              poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at optimum exposure and dose will be used to
              optimize ARC chemistry.  Plasma etch rates of the cured 193 nm ARCs will be
              compared to ARC CD11.  ARC stability and manufacturability will be determined. 
                   ARCs developed in Phase I would be further improved in Phase II and
              characterized with an amplified resist.  A successful product will be useful to
              integrated circuit makers, offering promise for increased packing density on
              semiconductor substrates.
