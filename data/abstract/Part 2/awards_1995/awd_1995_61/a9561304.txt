Abstract    :
              DMI-9561304  Trantolo    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore ferroelectric (FE) behavior of
              poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate), PBLG, which is an alpha-helical polymer when
              cast from appropriate solvents.  PBLG is known to display peizoelectric (PE)
              properties when aligned in magnetic or electric fields.  Analysis of the
              molecular conformation of the aligned dipoles suggests that the direction of
              the dipole vector in aligned PBLG films may be reversed by application of an
              electric field, thus producing FE behavior.  PBLG also has notable thermal
              stability, film-forming capability, and ease of alignment.  Phase I will
              demonstrate FE behavior and continue to explore mechanically compliant blends
              of PBLG with poly(isoprene) and poly(styrene).    This material could be useful
              for its PE and FE behavior and fi9nd application in transducers and and
              electro-optical switching.  These include pyroelectric detectors, ultrasonic
              and electro-acoustic transducers, and ultrasonic light modulators.
