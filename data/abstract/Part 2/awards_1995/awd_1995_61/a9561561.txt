Abstract    :
              9561561  Kale         This Small Business Innovations Research Phase I project
              proposes to develop a sophisticated environment, based on computer assisted
              software engineering (CASE) techniques, for development of parallel programs. 
              Although parallel programming is substantially difficult than sequential
              programming, the tools available for developing parallel programs are typically
              even more primitive than those for sequential programming.  This is partly due
              to the fact that the information available at the compile time to the system is
              inadequate to provide any substantial support during development.  Parallel
              object oriented languages provide a potential solution to this problem.  The
              specificity provided by objects is enhanced by other primitives in the system. 
              The compile time system may be able to support development of programs more
              effectively.  This project conducts research to determine the feasibility of
              such a parallel programming system, and to develop techniques that are
              necessary to building it. In addition to the novel exploitation of
              language-specificity, the research will also involve case techniques, and
              support for multi-lingual programs, and software reuse. The research will lead
              to a cohesive and integrated environment for supporting all phases in the
              software life-cycle of multi-lingual programs.       The software market for
              high performance parallel machines is starting to expand.  It is expected that
              parallel machines will be used in a more broad based set of application beyond
              the current scientific computation niche that they occupy.  Software
              development environments will fill an important need in this area, which
              remains unfulfilled as yet.
