Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              explore the use of advanced electromagnetic suspension and actuation technology
              to improve silicon wafer handling during Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP). 
              Current wafer RTP processing incurs substantial cost from lost wafers and
              facility downtime due to ball bearing failure and wear.  In addition to
              improved RTP equipment, manufacturers of wafer processing equipment need
              advanced facilities, which will make rolling element bearing technology
              obsolescent.  Advances are expected in higher rotation rates and larger
              diameter wafers.  Magnetic suspension and actuation technology looks promising
              for supporting and rotating a wafer in the high temperature corrosive
              atmosphere (fluorine, chlorine, HCl) used in RTP.       Phase I will combine
              design, analysis, prototype testing, and cost/per-formance trade-offs to
              demonstrate feasibility and to produce a cost competitive conceptual design for
              an integrated motoring and magnetic suspension system (IMMSS) for RTP
              facilities.  A prototype would be evaluated Phase II.  Magnetic suspension and
              actuation technology is ultimately applicable to a wide range of material
              handling problems in integrated circuit manufacture which require precise
              positioning; the absence of stiction; the absence of wear particle generation;
              and exposure to vacuum, corrosive, or high temperature environments.
