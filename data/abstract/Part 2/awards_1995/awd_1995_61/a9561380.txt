Abstract    :
              9561380  Turpen   The cost and availability of health care products based on
              peptides currently limit access to treatments.  New methods are needed to
              produce pharmaceutical quality proteins such as subunit vaccines and
              antimicrobial peptides for human use on a large scale.  This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the feasibility of producing
              peptides in plants fused to the surface of viral particles.  The approach of
              the small business Biosource Technologies, Inc. integrates the inexpensive
              synthesis of protein in plant biomass under non-sterile conditions with the
              design of an abundant, stable, and unique molecular structure that may easily
              be processed from plant extracts.     This project offers important social and
              commercial benefits:  By dramatically reducing production costs, this
              technology will enable vaccines and antibiotic peptides to be more accessible
              to a larger fraction of the world population who suffer from numerous
              infectious diseases.  By making vaccines and antibiotic treatments more
              affordable, substantial new markets will be created world-wide for these
              low-cost, high-volume health care products.
