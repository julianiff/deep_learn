Abstract    :
              9561260  Lavid         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop an innovative photochemical process capable of transforming
              existing stockpiles of ozone-depleting substances into environmentally benign
              and commercially valuable products. Existing stockpiles of chlorofluorocarbons
              (CFCs) pose a serious threat to the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.
              Their replacement with alternative materials will cause a significant disposal
              challenge. Currently, there is no economically practical and  Environmentally
              acceptable technology. This project offers a unique solution designated,
              Photo-HydroDechlorination (PHD). It is based on a synergistic effect of W
              initiation combined with a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen, promoting
              chain-propagation reactions and leading to high selectivity of desired
              products. The primary objective of project is to experimentally demonstrate
              feasibility by efficiently transforming representative CFCs into desirable
              hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and/or monomers. To accomplish this objective, a
              four-task research plan is used. It includes: (1) design and construction of a
              special photochemical flow reactor, (2) experimental demonstration, (3) kinetic
              modeling, and (4) cost estimates.       This project will lead to a "green"
              technology for environmentally safe transformation of ozone-depleting
              substances into commercially valuable products. The current stockpile of an
              estimated 4.5 billion pounds of CFCs, which poses a serious disposal problem,
              will become a vital feedstock to produce high value products. Based on
              preliminary cost estimates, the existing stockpile, which represents a huge
              environmental liability, can be turned into about $4 billion of saleable
              products.
