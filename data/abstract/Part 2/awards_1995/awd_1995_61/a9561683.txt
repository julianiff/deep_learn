Abstract    :
              9561683    Spencer    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will address mechanical liberation followed by optical sortation for
              automated, high-speed extraction of metals from the electronic fraction of
              post-consumer electronic products and durables.  Disposal of consumer
              electronic goods is a growing environmental concern and is expected to add
              significantly to the cost of U.S. electronics production.  Thus, the project is
              also part of NSF's 1995 initiative in Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing. 
                Optical sortation is presently applied to separate plastic bottles and to
              high-speed removal of contaminants from a stream of plastics.  This research
              will establish the feasibility of  extending this technology to the separation
              of one metal from another and from other materials typically used in
              electronics and durable goods.
