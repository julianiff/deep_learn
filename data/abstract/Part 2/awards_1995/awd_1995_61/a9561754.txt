Abstract    :
                  95-61754  Rose     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will evaluate a multicompartment electrodialysis cell using a new
              anion-exchange membrane for the separation and recovery of metals in
              contaminated wastewater. The initial application will be for chromium recovery
              from plating and metal finishing baths which is of both environmental and
              economic concern. Regulatory standards are increasingly stringent and
              significant savings would result from recovery and recycling of the metal. Use
              of membranes for filtration and concentration is a promising method to address
              the problem because they operate at low temperatures, do not generate new
              waste, and are able to handle large volumes. The proposed cell will permit
              simultaneous removal of both hexavalent and trivalent chromium from the waste
              stream. In the Phase I program a new membrane with high chemical resistance
              will be synthesized that is less expensive than perfluorinated membranes. Its
              chemical stability and electrical properties will be measured and compared to
              currently available membranes. The membrane will be incorporated into a
              three-compartment, laboratory-scale electrodialysis cell to demonstrate
              effective removal of toxic metal cations and hexavalent chromium. The Phase II
              program will incorporate the membrane into a multicell electrodialysis system
              to test with industrial effluents.   The electrodialysis cell with the new
              membrane will permit efficient and complete removal of toxic metals from
              industrial wastewater and concentrate them for reuse or disposal. Commercial
              applications include treatment of wastewater rinses from electroplating baths,
              tanning effluents, and metal finishing processes and recovery of strategic
              metals.
