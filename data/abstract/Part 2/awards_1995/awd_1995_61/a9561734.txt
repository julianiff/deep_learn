Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              extend the control of microelectronics manufacturing equipment systems down to
              room temperature.  As a state-of-the-art method for performing several
              important steps in semiconductor fabrication, Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) is
              the motivating application.  At high temperatures (above 500oC), sensors
              (pyrometers) are available for temperature measurement, and good process models
              exist, so that feedback control can be used.  At low temperatures (below 500oC)
              neither sensors nor models are available, so that feedback control is not
              possible.  Phase I will develop a physically-based nonlinear model of the
              process, valid at both low and high temperatures, and an innovative non-contact
              temperature sensor will be modeled.  These models will be combined, a baseline
              temperature controller will be synthesized, and a closed-loop system will be
              simulated to demonstrate control at low temperatures. In Phase II a prototype
              sensor would be built and tested in a commercial RTP chamber under closed-loop
              control.       This approach promises to make significant improvements in
              throughput by allowing precise control over a broad range of temperatures.  The
              new sensor and controller will be installed on an advanced commercial RTP
              chamber.  Potential commercial applications are expected for a real-time sensor
              and controller product with accompanying embedded software.
