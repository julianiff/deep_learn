Abstract    :
              9561013  Fernandez     One of the most pervasive and important current
              technological trends is the use of light (photonics) to perform functions that
              previously were accomplished with electronics, or which simply were not
              feasible with older technologies; it is an important area within which to
              provide laboratory experiences.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              I Project will develop a novel instrument to measure fluorescence lifetimes and
              associated courseware targeted to undergraduate university level laboratory
              teaching and learning in the physical, chemical, biological and engineering
              sciences.  The instrument is based on an inexpensive, rugged phase fluorometer
              recently developed at Ciencia.  In the Phase I, courseware modules will be
              developed for specific experiments suitable for the laboratory component of
              general undergraduate physics courses (for science students), as well as for
              sophomore level optics courses and senior level student research.  Ciencia will
              collaborate with the University of Connecticut Physics Department in the
              development of the teaching modules and for testing the system in the
              classroom.   This instrument will make it possible to bring, for the first
              time, to undergraduate laboratories a capability that until now has only been
              available at highly specialized research centers.  Potential applications span
              physics, chemistry, biology and engineering laboratory courses.  Potential
              commercial applications include undergraduate laboratory research as well as
              classroom teaching in the laboratory component of undergraduate science and
              engineering courses.  Potential markets include the physics, chemistry,
              biology, and engineering departments at colleges and universities.
