Abstract    :
              9561379  Chandler     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              seeks to discover one or more chemical additives for LiBr-H2O vapor absorption
              chillers that will significantly improve absorption rates compared to currently
              available additives. Current state-of-the-art absorption chiller technology
              uses performance additives to increase rates of vapor absorption in order to
              reduce absorber size and cost and to make the technology economically feasible.
              An additive meeting this goal will enable absorption chillers to be built with
              significantly smaller copper tube heat exchangers, resulting in reduced first
              costs. This in turn will allow for increased market share for absorption
              chillers in the air conditioning industry, and significantly enhance the
              competitiveness of this non-CFC containing alternative technology. Candidate
              additives will be selected based on the chemical properties that can be
              expected from their structure. Absorption rate enhancement activity will be
              determined using a falling film test absorption machine.   Potential commercial
              applications include all machines in service and all new designs of LiBr-H2O
              absorption chillers, used for cooling buildings requiring 100 tons to several
              thousand tons.
