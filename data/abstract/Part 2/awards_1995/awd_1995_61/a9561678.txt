Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
              novel z-axis connector technology using microporous materials. In this project,
              aluminum plates,  0.05-0.5 mm thick, would be anodized to form microporous
              alumina with densely packed, straight vertical (z-axis) pores of submicron
              diameters, and length to diameter ratios exceeding 500. When the pores are
              plated up with metals, the plates would have very high resistivity along the
              plane of the plate, and very low resistivity through the plate thickness,
              thereby enabling reliable z-axis connections between 2 planar circuit arrays,
              on sub-micron circuit elements. Such a mass connector between 2 semiconductor
              circuits would scale to large areas, provide micron-scale connections, and
              require no precision alignment between the connected circuits and would be low
              cost. With development in microporous alumina and silicon, it may be possible
              to form z-axis connections between microcircuits in a growth/deposition
              process, forming the connection directly on microcircuits without mechanical
              placement steps between circuits.   Anticipated benefits include: (1) the
              connection of dense arrays of microsensors, such as pressure, temperature or
              light sensor `pixels`, to a rear read-out chip containing signal processing,
              A-D conversion, etc. (`smart pixels`); (2) vertically stacked (z-stacked) VLSI
              circuits, such as memories, or processor and cache stacks of very high density;
              and (3) large flat panel displays, for example by connecting thin film
              transistor arrays to LCD active matrix pixels reliably over a large area.
