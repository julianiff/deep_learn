Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              technology for vacuum deposited high temperature SMA thin film for
              micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) systems. These films exhibit physical and
              mechanical characteristics identical and even better than those of conventional
              forms of TiNi. Perhaps most importantly, the process of thin film deposition is
              compatible with that for Si micromachining and offers a unique possibility for
              the mass production of highly integrated microdevices using SMA actuators.  
              This Phase I research effort will take advantage of the benefits of sputtering
              technique to obtain high temperature SMA actuators. Foils with a wide range of
              thickness (I to 20 microns) and composition will be produced for testing
              purposes and for use as actuators for fluid and gas microvalves designed by
              Ti-Ni Alloy Company.   Reliable and fast acting latching/release mechanisms,
              miniature resetable circuit breakers, safety devices, strip and membrane valve
              actuators are just some of potential uses for this material.
