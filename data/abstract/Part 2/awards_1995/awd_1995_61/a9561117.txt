Abstract    :
              95-61117  Johnson         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will focus on the  development of analytic techniques for the
              integration of density functionals.  In recent years, Density Functional Theory
              (DFT) has emerged as an accurate  alternative first-principles approach to
              quantum mechanical molecular  investigations, which is cost-effective compared
              with conventional correlated  methods. Unfortunately, the approximate density
              functionals used in practice  are quite complicated and numerical quadrature
              must be used for their  integration. There are difficulties inherent to such
              grid-based methods which  do not arise in methods where all the requisite
              integrals are evaluated  analytically, for example, as in Hartree-Fock theory.
              Unless great care is  taken in the handling of the molecular grid, undesirable
              effects manifest  themselves in the calculation. These various difficulties can
              be rigorously  handled, but their improper treatment is a source of problems in
              most  implementations.       The goal of the Phase I feasibility study is to
              develop an analytically  integrable density functional which yields a
              theoretical model chemistry  similar to that of the Dirac functional. We will
              implement the resulting  functional within the firm s quantum chemistry
              computer program.       A practical analytic method would eliminate the
              spurious effects  described above and at the same time would be quite likely to
              improve the  computation time for small and medium-sized systems. The
              commercial benefits  are apparent by measuring the substantial increase in both
              the quality of the  results and the efficiency of the system resulting in
              increased research  productivity and cost effectiveness.
