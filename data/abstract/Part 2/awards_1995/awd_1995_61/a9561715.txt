Abstract    :
                     Mechanical engineers have long recognized that the optimum way to match
              the performance characteristics of an  engine to the drive train of a vehicle
              is with a continuously variable transmission; and for more than 100 years, 
              designers have tried unsuccessfully to develop one which can match the torque
              capacity, efficiency, size, weight  and manufacturing cost of stepped√ratio
              transmissions. In 1989, Epilogics introduced the first fully geared, 
              continuously variable transmission for automobile and trucking applications.
              This transmission, called the IVT, has  the potential to satisfy these needs
              without sacrificing size, safety or performance. The key technical issue is
              that  of mechanical stresses on the internal components of the IVT. A thorough
              and systematic engineering analysis of  operating forces indicates that the
              most critical component is the one√way clutch. Such clutches in conventional 
              transmissions are cycled only when changing gears. Nominal lifetime
              requirements are one million cycles. The one√  way clutch in the IVT, without
              which the transmission would not work, is cycled once every revolution of the 
              transmission. The lifetime requiremeilt is 600 million cycles, or more than two
              orders of magnitude greater than the  requirements of a standard device. The
              lack of a one√way clutch is presently the key technical barrier to the 
              widespread commercial development of the IVT. The goal of the Phase I research
              project is to demonstrate the  feasibility of developing a suitable one√way
              clutch. If successful, Phase II will carry the development further by  building
              a number of pre√commercial prototype units and comprehensively testing them. If
              a technical solution can  be demonstrated, Epilogics has an industrial partner
              ready to pursue the initial commercialization of the technology.
