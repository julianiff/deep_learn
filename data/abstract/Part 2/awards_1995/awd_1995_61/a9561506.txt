Abstract    :
              9561506  Quarles     As lasers evolve from an object of basic scientific study
              into rugged components that are used in an ever-increasing number of real-world
              applications, courses that acquaint students with the basic operating
              principles of laser devices are becoming an important part of the engineering
              and physics curricula in a number of colleges and universities.  This Small
              Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the necessary
              hardware components for a one semester course on laser operating principles for
              advanced undergraduate and masters-level graduate students.  The proposed
              laboratory package will take advantage of recent technical advances in
              diode-pumped solid state laser technology, that now make it possible to design
              a complete laser laboratory course based on a set of low cost components. 
              During Phase I, the necessary components for the kit will be identified,
              engineered, and fabricated at Lightning Optical Corporation.  Simultaneously, a
              set of laboratory notes outlining experiments to be performed with the
              Laboratory Optics Kit will be prepared.  Five prototype test kits will be
              assembled and delivered to the Center for Research and Education in Optics and
              Lasers at the University of Central Florida, where they will be tested as the
              basis for a one-semester laboratory course scheduled to be offered during the
              1996 summer semester.  The anticipated final result of this project is the
              marketing of a self-contained, economical laser laboratory package by Lightning
              Optical Corporation, complete with hardware, optics, and lab text.   This
              project offers the prospect of the commercial introduction of a laser
              laboratory package consisting of optics and hardware kits and an accompanying
              lab text.  The availability of this package should make it possible for
              graduate and undergraduate institutions to add a laboratory component to
              classroom courses on laser operating principles.
