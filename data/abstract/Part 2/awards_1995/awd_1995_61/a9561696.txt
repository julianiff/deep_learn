Abstract    :
              9561696  Schroeder         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I Project will investigate a novel thermoelectric loop for stored energy, which
              would be released later to balance peak demands on electric utility grids. 
              Electric power costs six times more to produce and distribute during peak hours
              than during full-out production at night.  A practical storage means would
              reduce production costs as well as pollution and defer building new capacity
              for ten years.       Research objectives are to determine if large scale
              thermoelectric generators, operating with industrial waste heat, can store
              sufficient energy, at low loss, to satisfy next day's peak demand.  Storage
              experiments and characterization on multi-turn, increasing-scale thermoelectric
              units will allow performance extrapolations that describe an industrial scale,
              60-MWh storage system.  Performance curves are expected to predict practical
              operation of a 60-MWh store for grid leveling.  Commercial applications of this
              research will be a safe, efficient, low-cost, solid-state, distributed means of
              storing electricity to satisfy daytime peak demands on utility grids.
