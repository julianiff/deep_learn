Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              explore an automated design, analysis, and manufacturing (ADAM) system specific
              to an advanced spray cooling technology.  The system will incorporate the most
              recent advances in parametric design, finite element analysis (FEA), database
              management, and dynamic data exchange, coupled to principles of design for
              manufacturability and assembly, agile and just-in-time manufacturing, and
              virtual corporations.  Phase I will demonstrate key feasibility issues. 
              Specifically, an `intelligent` interface will access customer input of
              multi-chip module (MCM) geometry and operational constraints to automate the
              generation of a 3-dimensional solid model of an optimized spray cooled MCM. 
              Integration tools will transfer this model to FEA for performance predictions
              and generate the appropriate machine code for automatic fabrication of a
              prototype.       The ADAM system will be applied to advanced spray cooling for
              electronics manufacture.  However specific to spray cooling, the techniques and
              methodologies developed here will be widely applicable to other mechanical
              systems.  As an `enabling` technology, it will be applied to supercomputers,
              advanced servers, MCMs, power electronics, radar, and avionics.  This range of
              design requirements necessitates a general strategy in Phase I, which is
              expected to be widely useful in the research field of agile manufacturing. 
              Once fully developed, turn key ADAM systems can be supplied to many commercial
              users.
