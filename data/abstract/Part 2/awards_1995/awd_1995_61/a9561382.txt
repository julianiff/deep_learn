Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              problems associated with current microelectronics lithography systems which
              utilize masking technology.  These problems include: the need for multiple
              masks required for subsequent layers of an electronic module; the difficulties
              associated with generating large-area masks; and the dependence on foreign
              suppliers for mask substrates.  The only available technology which does not
              require masks is laser direct-write imaging, which is inherently slow due to
              it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing.  Phase I develop a maskless,
              large-area, high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system which combines
              a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) with an established patterning technology. 
              The DMD is a micro-mechanical, spatial light modulator with high
              parallel-processing power and replaces the conventional mask without any loss
              in throughput.  When used in conjunction with a seamless scanning technology,
              it can generate any possible pattern with hiqh resolution over an unlimited
              area.       This technology is expected to meet a critical need in the
              microelectronics manufacturing industry and also significantly increase U.S.
              competitiveness in an enabling technology area.
