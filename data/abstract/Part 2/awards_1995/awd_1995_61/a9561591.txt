Abstract    :
                9561591  Bartos     Corrosion inhibitors are widely used for the protection of
              metal surfaces against corrosion.  In some cases, their use is the only
              possible way to protect metals from an aggressive environment.  Corrosion
              inhibitors cover a wide spectrum of chemical substances including both
              inorganic and organic compounds.  In many cases, however, the highly efficient
              inhibitors are very toxic and, therefore, are a high risk to health and to the
              environment.  There is a great need for new, low cost, environmentally safe,
              high performance corrosion inhibitors to replace the existing no-longer
              satisfactory substances such as chromates.  This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will examine a new class of naturally based corrosion
              inhibitors.  These materials have the potential to meet the need for a
              completely non-toxic, environmentally safe corrosion inhibitor.  In Phase I,
              research will be carried out to investigate critical issues related to the
              preparation and performance of the new inhibitor.   The proposed new corrosion
              inhibitor should be highly efficient, non-toxic, biodegradable and is prepared
              almost entirely from renewable natural resources.  Furthermore, the proposed
              technology is simple and the raw materials are low-cost.  These key features
              are of great commercial potential for all applications where metallic surfaces
              have to be protected against corrosion.
