Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a
              new approach to internal-node integrated circuit (IC) testing.  An atomic force
              microscope (AFM) will be used as a non-contact voltage probe for testing
              high-speed ICs.  It can be positioned and used to image the IC with nanometer
              accuracy.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to measure signal frequencies
              up to 70 GHz.  The probe works in air and can sense voltages through
              passivating dielectric layers.  Small electrical forces are detected by using a
              flexible micro-mechanical cantilever and an atomically sharp, conductive tip. 
              The tip hovers over the IC and stroboscopically samples the voltage waveform on
              the metal trace below it.       With progressive scaling in chip linewidths,
              speed, and complexity, ICs are outstripping the capabilities of conventional
              systems to test them.  Present technologies are lacking in measurement
              bandwidth, spatial resolution, and accuracy.  Low-end probing solutions, such
              as contact probes, risk damage to the IC and perturbation of circuit operation.
               High-end solutions, such as electron-beam testers, have the disadvantages of
              great complexity and cost, low sequential throughput, and inflexibility.  This
              new technology has potential for overcoming some current deficiencies and
              affording new solutions for accurate measurements in design verification and
              fault isolation in the IC design cycle.
