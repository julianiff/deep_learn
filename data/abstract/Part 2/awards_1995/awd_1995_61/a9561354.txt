Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              that a spectral imaging device with high spatial, spectral, and temporal
              resolution can be created by combining a charge-coupled device (CCD) array with
              an integrated array of volume holographic micro-mirrors. In POC's Spectral
              Imaging Micro-Mirror Array Sensor (SIMMAS) device, the micro-mirror array will
              filter the scene imaged onto the detector array, allowing the spectral
              characteristics of the scene to be determined after simple numerical post
              processing. Since the filter array is passive, the speed of the system will be
              limited only by the detector and post processing system, which will operate at
              video frame rates. The band-rejection nature of the device will result in high
              signal throughput, yielding a large signal-to-noise ratio and allowing its use
              low light levels. The specific innovations in the project are the creation of
              an integrated holographic micro-mirror array and the application of this array
              to spectral imaging.       The SIMMAS device can be broadly applied to those
              commercial scenarios where compact and low-cost spectral imaging is
              advantageous. such as hand-held field inspection systems, robust industrial
              inspection systems. plasma engine diagnostic systems (for NASA applications),
              medical biosensors. and remote sensing (satellite) systems.
