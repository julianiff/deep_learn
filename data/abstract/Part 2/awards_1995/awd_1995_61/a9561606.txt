Abstract    :
              9561606  Torti         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensor which
              utilizes discrete counting electrodes and a suspended slider.  Precision
              displacement sensors have a multitude of uses in industrial processing, the
              operation of linear and rotary machines, robotics, and the semiconductor
              industry.  However, for well developed technologies such as cap-acitive
              sensors, factors like cost per channel, limited range, and sensitivity to gap
              medium inhibit their use.       The range of this sensor is limited by the
              linear extent over which dimensional tolerances can be met on the die. 
              Resolution is constrained by the fraction of the minimum feature size that can
              be interpolated with the processing electronics.  With the slider-to-target gap
              positioned electronically, variations in refractive index can be compensated
              and active guarding is obviated.  This design should increase resolution while
              reducing drift and decreasing cost.  It utilizes a three-layer nickel
              construction with a monolithically attached, tall facing electrode, fabricated
              with deep plasma etching.  Force attenuation is electrostatic.  With the
              electronics and MEMS integrated onto a common substrate, commercial devices
              could be manufactured inexpensively and compactly.  Phase I will identify
              promising geometry's, sensing and drive electronics will be designed, and test
              structures will be produced.  A full scale prototype is expected to be made in
              Phase II.
