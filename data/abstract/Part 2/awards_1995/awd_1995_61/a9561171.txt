Abstract    :
                          This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              design an adaptive critic based controller for use in optimizing control of
              complex large-scale, multi-goal systems which exhibit nonlinear dynamics. 
              Currently implemented Adaptive Critic controllers often work well on
              small-scale problems, but convergence is slow on complex large-scale problems. 
              In addition, the need to optimize performance with competing goals makes
              learning and convergence of adaptive critic controllers difficult.  Phase I
              will demonstrate this adaptive critic controller on a typical but challenging
              problem: optimization of auto driving characteristics over a standard driving
              cycle.  The controller will optimize throttle control, acceleration,
              deceleration, and braking so as to minimize energy expenditure over the course
              while also traversing the cycle in a minimum time span.  This is similar to a
              long-haul truck driver searching for an optimal sequence of gas pedal and brake
              controls to go from New York to Los Angeles in minimum time and burning minimum
              fuel (and traveling through hills and mountains in between).       Commercial
              applications of adaptive critic controllers of this kind are expected
              semiconductor manufacturing and flight control as well as in the automotive
              control problem.
