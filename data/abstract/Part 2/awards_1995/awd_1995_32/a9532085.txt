              Zhang    This Research Planning Grant will support an investigation of the 
              relation   between  crystal  structure,  anisotropy,  interplanar  spacing, 
              and transition temperature and the physical  properties  of  flux  pinning,
              flux creep, the irreversibility line, and  the  critical  current density. 
              Single crystal samples  of  the  high  temperature  superconducting single Cu-O
              layer compounds  of  the  lanthanum,  thallium,  and  mercury  cuprates  will  
              be   grown,  characterized  and measured.  The results of this planning  grant 
              will  provide  a  foundation for further study of these  strongly  layered
              materials.  %%%  This Research Planning Grant will support an investigation of
              the  relation between crystal structure and physical properties of the  high
              temperature superconductors (HTS).  A limitation in the  use  of HTS is the
              control of properties that enhance the current that  can   flow   without  
              resistance  in  these   materials.    This  investigation will grow single
              crystals of several classes of HTS  having  a  single  copper-oxygen layer and
              measure  the  critical  current  and  other parameters and their relation to
              the  crystal  structure and the anisotropic properties of these crystals.  ***
