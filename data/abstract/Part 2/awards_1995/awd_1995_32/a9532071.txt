Abstract    :
              9532071  CHARLESWORTH   This research will test  recent theories that highly
              selfing species should be depauperate in neutral variation. Theoretically, the
              pattern and amount of genetic variation in plant populations are greatly
              influenced by the mating system which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the
              self-fertilization rate.  Nucleotide sequence variation will be quantified in a
              group of plants with known differences in self-fertilization rates
              (Leavenworthia ; Brassicaceae). The resulting data will allow the comparison of
              levels of neutral and fitness-related variation at the nucleotide level among
              taxa with diverse breeding systems. Understanding  the influence of inbreeding
              on genetic variability at neutral and fitness related loci, and the causes of
              differences in each kind of genetic diversity among populations, is important
              in relation to all aspects of plant genetics.   Findings on genetic variation
              from natural populations will also be of value for plant genetic conservation. 
              Conservation biologists assume that inbreeding taxa are highly susceptible to
              environmental degradation, because of their low reservoir of genetic
              variability in traits affecting fitness. The funded research addresses the
              validity of this assumption by quantifying fitness-related genetic variation
              for such highly inbred populations. The nucleotide sequence data can be further
              utilized for inferring the phylogeny of the group studied. This will, in turn,
              ppovide a valuable framework for understanding the evolutionary history of
              breeding system traits and life history characters in the genus.
