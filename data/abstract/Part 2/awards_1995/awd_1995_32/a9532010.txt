Abstract    :
              9532010  KNOX         In 1996 Scripps Institute of Oceanography will operate 
              research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and ROBERT GORDON SPROUL in  support of
              NSF-sponsored oceanographic research.  MELVILLE will  mainly support Marine
              Geology and Geophysical cruises in the south  Pacific, requiring SEA BEAM 2000.
               Mid-year the vessel will work  stand-down for two months.  MELVILLE will end
              the year in off the  coast of Chile.  A mid-life refit is planned for R/V NEW
              HORIZON in  early 1996.  The vessel will reenter service in May and will 
              support a variety biological and physical oceanography off the west  coast of
              the US and Mexico.  R/V ROBERT GORDON SPROUL will do short  cruises off the
              coast of California and one cruise in the Columbia  River estuary.       The
              SIO vessels are part of a fleet utilized by the National  Science Foundation in
              support of oceanographic research.  Most  oceanographic projects require highly
              specialized equipment and  extensive support from the ship's crew members. 
              Increasingly  research projects require equipment which must be permanently 
              installed on the vessel, thus requiring specialized ships.  The  ships do not
              operate the same as general cargo/fishing vessels,  therefore, NSF supports the
              operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic
              research that are operated  by universities and research institutes around the
              country.
