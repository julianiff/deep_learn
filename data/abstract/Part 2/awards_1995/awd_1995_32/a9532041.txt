Abstract    :
              9532041  DeBra   Thermal control and temperature gradients in machine tools and
              metrology instruments are fundamental limitations to precision engineering.   A
              way to minimize these limitations is using hydraulic actuation and sensing,
              because of its high and efficient transfer of energy.  This approach is also
              compatible with oil showering, one of the ways thermal control is achieved in
              ultra-precision manufacturing.  This project will develop an ultra precision
              machine tool based on laminar flow motors and linear actuators, and oil
              differential gages for straightness and yaw compensation.   These components
              were developed at Stanford University, in part with NSF Strategic Manufacturing
              Initiative support, to eliminated control of hydraulic actuators by throttling
              which leads to turbulence, noise and vibration.  The major research efforts
              will be on development of compatible hydraulic sensors and integration of the
              quite actuators in an ultra precision, quiet hydraulic diamond turning machine.
                  The impact of this research is primarily on the infrastructure for
              precision engineering and ultra precision machine tools.  It promises better
              thermal control at lower cost than is possible with existing ultra precision
              machines and equipment.
