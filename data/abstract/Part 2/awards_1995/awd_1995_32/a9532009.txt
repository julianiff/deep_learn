Abstract    :
              9532009  JONES         Oregon State University (OSU) will operate the R/V WECOMA
               during 1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-  sponsored
              projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 185' general research  vessel constructed in
              1975 and owned by the National Science  Foundation.  The vessel underwent a
              mid-life refit and general  upgrade in 1994.  OSU operates the WECOMA under a
              charter agreement  with NSF.  The ship is scheduled for 180 operating days in
              1996, of  which 104 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The 
              remaining 76 days are in support of Navy programs.  The cruises  will be mainly
              in the north pacific off the US west coast.         This vessel is part of a
              fleet used by NSF to support  oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic
              research requires  highly specialized equipment that must be permanently
              installed on  a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This 
              equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and
              operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo
              or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the  operation of a variety of
              vessels specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and  research institutions around the country.
