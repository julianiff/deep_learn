              Abstract  ATM-9532074  Bartlein, Patrick J.  University of Oregon  Title:
              Quaternary Paleoclimatic Variations of Beringia: Large-scale          Controls
              and Regional Responses    The climate system of the Arctic is a key component
              of the global  system, and an understanding of the nature of paleoclimatic 
              variations in the Arctic is therefore an important element in  predicting how
              that region may respond to changes in the large-  scale controls of climate. 
              This PALE/ARCSS award supports the  analysis of Quaternary paleoecological
              records from Beringia to a)  document the nature and magnitude of past climatic
              changes, b) test  hypotheses about the controls of regional climatic
              variations, and  how changes in those controls are expressed at the regional
              and  local levels, and c) exploit the growing number of  paleoenvirnomental
              records from this region for use in the  examination of paleoclimatic
              variations along key transects and for  application in model-validation
              studies.  This analysis requires  the compilation of modern sets of climate and
              vegetation data from  the region, and their use to establish relationships
              between  vegetation and climate.  These relationships can then be applied to 
              a) interpret fossil-pollen data in climate terms, thereby  illustrating the
              range of past climate changes, b) test specific  hypotheses about the controls
              of past climatic variations by  comparing the "observed" record of vegetation
              change with that  implied by the hypotheses, and c) validate climate model 
              simulations of Arctic paleoclimates.
