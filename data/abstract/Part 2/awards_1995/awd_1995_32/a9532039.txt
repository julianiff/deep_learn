Abstract    :
              DMS 95-32039:  Wellner    This research involves the study of  empirical
              processes,  bootstrap methods in statistics, semiparametric models, and  
              inverse problems and nonstandard asymptotics.  The research will   involve
              limit theory for infinite - dimensional  M - estimates  and   related bootstrap
              methods, preservation theorems for uniform  Donsker   classes of functions,
              uniform in P bootstrap limit theorems,   estimation of monotone and convex
              functions, convergence of  iterative   convex minorant algorithms, and the
              behavior of global  functionals in   models with interval censoring.    %%% 
              For the analysis of failure time data which are subject to right   censoring
              and/or left truncation, many methods are now available.    However, in many
              biomedical studies, including those arising from    HIV/AIDS studies, failure
              times are censored or truncated in more    complicated ways.  One such
              complication is ``interval  censoring'',   in which one knows that the event of
              interest occurs within a  random   time interval, but not the exact timing: for
              example,  HIV  positivity   or the drop of the CD4 count below a certain
              threshold may only  be   determined to be between two clinical visits, but not
              the exact  time  may remain unknown.   This research will involve developing
              new   statistical method for data arising from these and other more  
              complicated censoring mechanisms ranging from animal   carcinogenesis
              experiments to data in sociology and   econometrics modelling.  A detailed
              study and evaluation    of the properties of methods recently proposed by other
               statisticians   will be completed.   ***
