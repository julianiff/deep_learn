Abstract    :
              CMS-9532061    The failure of systems composed of brittle materials such as 
              concrete and  rock is controlled by the development and accumulation of 
              microdefects  referred to as damage.  Macroscopically, damage reduces the 
              elastic  stiffness, causes anisotropy, and reduces the load-carrying  capacity
              of the  material.  The objective of this research is to identify  damage
              through the  acoustic emission (AE) technique and to use this measurement  of
              damage to  assess the onset of failure in systems composed of rock-like 
              materials.    The accumulation of damage has a fundamental importance for 
              defining the  behavior of brittle materials in terms of their strength.  In
              addition, the  importance of detecting brittle failure of structures is 
              brought on by the  use of high-strength concrete, by the urgency in preserving 
              classical  monuments, and by the need to evaluate aggregate durability.  It is
              claimed  that a quantitative analysis of damage can be applied to  components
              of  full-scale structures by simplifying the deconvolution  process for 
              determining source mechanisms and orientations.  The impact  of this  research
              on the infrastructure will be the real-time  monitoring of systems  to evaluate
              damage in the form of cracks, voids, loss of  bond, and other  detrimental
              processes leading to failure.    ***
