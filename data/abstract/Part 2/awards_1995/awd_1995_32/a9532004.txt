Abstract    :
                9532004  Wilsdorf  The expected effect of lubricants on metal amorphization in
               severe tribocontacts will be studied by shearing of stacks  of pure metal
              foils, or powders, in a high pressure Bridgman  anvil apparatus in a lubricated
              environment.  The tests will  start with copper and silver foils and later
              extend to  copper and iron foils and powders.  The lubricants to be  tested
              include paraffin oil, an additive-containing oil, and  a high pressure
              synthetic oil.   The shear resistance will  be measured and X-ray analysis will
              be performed to  determine the extent of amorphization.  Microstructure of  the
              near-subsurface material will be determined by electron  microscopy.  It is
              hoped that the study will lay the  foundation for the characterization of the
              materials  behavior which controls the microscopic contact volumes  under
              typical tribological asperity contacts.  ***
