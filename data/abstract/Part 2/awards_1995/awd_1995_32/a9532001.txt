Abstract    :
              9532001  McDuff         The R/V THOMPSON has a schedule of 248 operational days
              in  1996 of which 164 are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The  THOMPSON
              has been supporting the JGOFS program in the Indian Ocean  for the past 15
              months.  This program will finish in January 1996.   The vessel will than
              transit to do a MGG program off south Africa,  from there it transits to do a
              physical oceanography program in the  south Pacific.  After several State
              graduate student training  cruises out of Seattle the vessel will support a MGG
              mapping cruise  in the northwest Pacific.  The THOMPSON will end the year doing
              a  maintenance period following an extensive schedule in a remote  area.       
              The R/V BARNES schedule for 1996 is for a total of 102 days of  which 75
              operational days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.   The NSF days
              include a 34 day trip to the Columbia River (Oregon)  for the second year.  The
              remainder of the work is in Puget Sound,  Lake Washington and one two-week
              cruise in the Canadian San Juan  Islands.          The THOMPSON and BARNES are
              part of a fleet of ships used by  the National Science Foundation in support of
              marine science  research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly
              specialized  equipment permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity 
              for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same  mode as
              general cargo/fishing vessels, as a result NSF supports the  operation of a
              variety of vessels specifically dedicated to  oceanographic research that are
              operated by universities and  institutions around the country.  ***
