Abstract    :
              9532087  Venkata  This funding is requested in order to permit attendance of 20 
              U.S. participants at the international conference on Power  Electronics, Drives
              and Energy Systems for Industrial Growth to  be held in New Delhi, India during
              January 8-11, 1996.  The  conference is jointly sponsored/organized by the IEEE
              Industrial  Applications Society, the IEEE Power Electronics Society, IEEE 
              Power Engineering, and IEEE Indian Sections.  The organizers are  seeking
              active international participation to provide a forum for  academia, engineers,
              and researchers in industry to discuss the  latest developments in power
              electronics, drives, energy systems  and related areas.  The primary purpose if
              the U.S. participation  is to disseminate and transfer the latest research
              ideas on  various topics of relevance to the conference theme.    India
              represents one of the most dynamic economics in the world  today, with an
              enormous potential for consuming, manufacturing,  and supplying high-quality
              engineering products.  The conference  is to provide a forum for academia,
              researchers, and engineers to  discuss the challenges, problems, and directions
              of the future  technological growth of India and other developing nations.  
              Today many U.S. companies are seeking an active presence in India  through
              partnerships with Indian firms, in order to access a  share of this emerging
              market, and to be able to utilize the  lower-cost technical work force. 
              Another of the goals of PEDES  1996 is to provide a mechanism for fostering
              contacts that will  enable the formation of such partnerships.  Through the 
              exhibition at the conference, U.S. companies will be able to  display their
              capabilities, and further their long-term business  interests in India.  ***
