Abstract    :
              9532079  With  Metapopulation theory is one of the underlying paradigms of
              conservation biology. Patch-based models, such as metapopulation theory, deal
              with spatial complexity in a simplistic fashion to render the models
              analytically tractable. This research will couple a generalized hierarchical
              model of population structure with neutral landscape models to provide a
              unifying framework for understanding population dynamics in patchy
              environments.  Neutral landscape models are a key element in the development of
              generalized spatially explicit theory of population responses to landscape
              structure. The specific goals of this research are to investigate the
              demographic consequences of habitat fragmentation by (1) varying life-history
              and dispersal parameters of species in spatially complex landscapes and
              searching for extinction thresholds, (2) assessing how the scale of habitat
              fragmentation interacts with the demographic potential and dispersal abilities
              of species as detected by shifts in extinction thresholds, and (3) comparing
              how extinction thresholds relate to critical thresholds in landscape
              connectivity.    Percolation theory has served as a model framework for
              understanding the dispersion of species in complex landscapes. This research is
              unique because it unites in one modeling approach population biology, landscape
              ecology and conservation biology within an expanded framework defined by
              percolation modeling.
