Abstract    :
                    9532056  Jiles  This award is to provide a better understanding of certain
               magnetic properties of steels that can be used for the  nondestructive
              evaluation of its mechanical state.  a theoretical  model will also be
              developed to permit the phenomena to be used  for safety predictions of steel
              structural members.  Prior  research has demonstrated the phenomena but its
              physical basis is  poorly understood and how to use it under service conditions
              is  therefore needed.  The key idea is to use both surface and bulk 
              measurements to assess the residual stress in these materials.   Magnetic data
              has been shown to be highly sensitive to the  mechanical condition of the
              material.  ***
