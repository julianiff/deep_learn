Abstract    :
              9532081  Walker  The dynamics of dextrous manipulation involving contact 
              conditions is investigated in this research project. Typical  examples of tasks
              with a predominant contact include  insertion, tapping and levering, etc. The
              ability to use  contact dynamics can often completely transform the nature  of
              a task, making its performance faster and simpler than  under quasi-static
              constraints. Specifically, this research  project formulates new models of
              dynamic dextrous grasping  and manipulation, focusing on the question of
              dynamics  resulting from impact; identifies canonical dynamic grasping  tasks
              involving contact and impact, and develops effective  algorithms for planning
              and performing these tasks; and  experimentally evaluates the developed
              algorithms using  multi fingered hardware hands.***
