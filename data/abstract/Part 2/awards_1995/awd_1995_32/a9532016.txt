Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,  
              Professor John Baldwin of Syracuse University will study the   characteristics
              of chemical reactions involving diradical intermediates   or transition states.
               The stereochemistry of the isomerizations of   several small, strained ring
              compounds will be determined using   deuterium, or occasionally carbon-13,
              labels as stereochemical markers.    The small systems proposed for study allow
              for high quality quantum   mechanical computations of the appropriate
              hypersurfaces, which in turn   allows a uniquely detailed comparison between
              theory and experiment for   organic reactions.  Understanding of the simplest,
              and the most straightforward appearing,   chemical reactions at a level of
              great detail is a way to understand the   very nature of chemical reactivity.
              This work provides the experimental   foundation for eventual quantum
              mechanical understanding of simple   thermal molecular rearrangements.
