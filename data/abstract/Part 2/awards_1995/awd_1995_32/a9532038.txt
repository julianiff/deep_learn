Abstract    :
                  9532038  Sottos  This award supports experimental and theoretical research
              on the  characterization of small scale smart materials.  These materials  are
              used in micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS).  a unique 
              micro-interferometric technique and the photoelastic method will  be used to
              measure local deformations from internal actuations or  external loads. 
              Results of these experiments will then be used  to evaluate existing smart
              material models for use at this  smaller scale.  Special attention will be
              given to the effects of  residual stresses induced during processing and poling
              of these  materials.  ***
