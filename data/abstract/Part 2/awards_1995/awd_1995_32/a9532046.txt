Abstract    :
                AST-9532046        Summary:    The objective of this project is to develop
              millimeter-wave  integrated circuits (MMIC's) with high sensitivity and low 
              replication cost to enable the fabrication of focal-plane  arrays with 50 to
              1000 pixels for use in radio astronomy.  These arrays should have noise
              temperatures competitive with  the best single pixel receivers using SIS
              mixers, but with  vastly lower cost and simpler operation.    The project has a
              wide scope to cover many aspects of focal-  plane array systems.  The following
              topics are included: 1)  Optimization of high-electron-mobility transistor
              (HEMT)  material composition to provide lowest noise at cryogenic 
              temperatures.  2.) Design, fabrication, and testing of MMIC  low-noise
              amplifiers to cover the bands of 33-50, 65-90, and  85-115 GHz.  A minimum of
              30 MMIC's of each type will be  made available as samples for evaluation at
              radio astronomy  observatories.
