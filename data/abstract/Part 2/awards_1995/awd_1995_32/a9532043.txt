Abstract    :
              9532043  Wu  This Research Equipment Grant will be used to purchase the 
              electronics, temperature control chamber and computer to upgrade an  existing
              servo-controlled axial-torsion materials testing system in  the Department of
              Civil and Environmental Engineering at the  University of Iowa.  The equipment
              will be used for projects that  represent a broad range of research activities
              that require multi-  axial loading capability.  The research projects include
              large  plastic deformation of aluminum, mechanics of damaged materials, 
              deformation, fatigue and failure of metal matrix and polymer  composites,
              strength and cracking of fresh water ice and strength  of human lumbar spinal
              implants.  These projects will be carried  out by several faculty members and
              will increase interactions among  researchers of significantly different
              disciplines and research  interests.  ***
