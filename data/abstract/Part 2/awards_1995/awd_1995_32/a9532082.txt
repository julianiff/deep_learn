Abstract    :
              ***  9532082  Betti  The fundamental objective of the research is a systematic 
              and comprehensive investigation of the environmental  deterioration of the
              high-strength bridge wires under the  actual service conditions. The research
              will focus on four  different tasks. In task 1, a proper determination of the 
              stress intensity and distribution in high-strength wires  will be investigated.
              The importance of residual stresses  due to wire manufacturing processes,
              initial stresses due to  straightening of coiled wires and applied stresses due
              to  imposed external loads will be considered. Task 2 will  investigate the
              determination of the rate of wire  deterioration under normal and accelerated
              conditions of  environment/wire reactions while the effects of hydrogen 
              embrittlement and corrosion assisted cracking will be the  focus of task 3.
              Deteriorated galvanized and ungalvanized  bridge wires as well as new wires
              will be subjected to  experimental testing simulating aggressive corrosive 
              environment. Theoretical analyses will be performed to  interpret the
              experimental results. Task 4 will concentrate  on the evaluation of the effects
              of wire metallurgy on the  rate of wire deterioration in a corrosive
              environment.  Studies on recent developments in wire manufacturing and on  new
              materials will be conducted in view of the conclusions  from the previous
              tasks.***
