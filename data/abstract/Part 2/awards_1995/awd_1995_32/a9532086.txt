Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9532086     A high-resolution electron energy-loss spectrometer
              (HREELS) is acquired and installed in an existing ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
              chamber.  Use includes analysis of thiols and other organosulfur compounds on
              molybdenum crystals and on sulfided or carbided molybdenum.  These studies are
              relevant to hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processes.   ***
