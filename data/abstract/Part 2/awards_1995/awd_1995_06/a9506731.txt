Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This award provides partial support for the continuation of
              activities of the Polar Research Board (PRB) for the period January 1, 1995
              through December 31, 1995.  The activities are designed to make research in the
              polar regions more productive and responsive to the needs of the United States,
              and to maintain U.S. awareness and representation in ongoing international
              science programs.  Overall, the Board's program provides national and
              international scientific and technical information of the U.S. government
              policy makers and the polar research community, represents U.S. interests in
              international non-governmental polar scientific organizations, and conducts
              special programmatic studies in areas of polar science and technology deemed
              necessary by the government, research and business community, or the PRB.    To
              that end, the Board will actively assist the International Arctic Science
              Committee (IASC) in U.S. preparations for, and holding the International
              Conference for Arctic Research Planning in 1995.  The conference, to be
              co-hosted by Dartmouth College and the U.S. Army's Cold Regions Research and
              Engineering Laboratory, is sponsored by the PRB and the National Science
              Foundation.  During the year, the Board will also provide information on the
              activities of IASC and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)(a
              non-governmental science organization which also serves as an advisory body to
              the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, to the U.S. government agencies and
              polar research community through regular meetings, mailings and electronic
              mail.  An annual report of the Board for 1995 will be published, and its
              activities will also be reported in the Journal of Antarctic Research and
              Arctic Research of the United States.
