Abstract    :
              9506741   Nei      This award supports a joint U.S.-Japan Workshop on Molecular 
              Evolution to explore two topics of current interest: 1) theory  and practice of
              molecular phylogenetics; and 2) molecular  evolution of morphogenesis and
              adaptive characters.  Researchers  who are early in their careers will be the
              primary participants  at this workshop.  The workshop will be held on August
              26-27,  1995 at the Graduate School of Advanced Studies, Hayama, Japan  and is
              being held in conjunction with the Third International  Meeting of the Society
              for Molecular Biology and Evolution.      This workshop in molecular evolution
              fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              young  investigators from the United States and Japan to meet and  discuss
              research problems of mutual interest and importance.  It  is the expectation of
              the program that research partnerships will  develop from this opportunity.
