Abstract    :
                  9506094  Kropf    The  research described in this proposal will investigate
              the  cytoskeletal and ionic bases of polarity in zygotes of the brown  alga
              Pelvetia. The premise in this proposal is that the acquisition  of polarity is
              a highly regulated reorganization of the cell which  will be best understood by
              investigating relationships between key  regulatory processes. Dr. Kropf will
              study cytoskeletal control of  polarity, and then investigate the relationship
              between the  cytoskeleton and cytosolic regulatory ions. Preliminary evidence 
              indicates that cortical F-actin localizes in a patch soon after  fertilization,
              and expands into a ring that portends the future  rhizoid site. Dr. Kropf
              hypothesizes that sperm entry induces local  F-actin polymerization that then
              serves as a determinant of  polarity, specifically marking the future rhizoid
              site. This  hypothesis will be examined using cryofixation, confocal microscopy
               and TEM. Prior to mitosis, the nucleus rotates 90 degrees bringing 
              centrosomes into an axial alignment. This nuclear rotation  determines the
              axial orientation of the spindle and transverse  alignment of the first
              division plane. Microtubules are thought to  be primarily responsible for
              nuclear rotation, and their dynamic  behavior during rotation will be
              investigated in real time by  injecting zygotes with fluorescently tagged
              tubulin. Centrosome  assembly and function will also be investigated. Finally
              the  hypothesis that the assembly and function of cytoskeletal elements  are
              regulated by local ion activities, specifically H+ and CA+2  activities, will
              be investigated.  ***
