Abstract    :
              SBR-9506062  This dissertation-improvement award provides funds for field
              equipment, travel, and  language training for the Student's research into
              Ghanaian women's development and use of  social networks (particularly for
              financing entrepreneurial ventures) since the early 1980s.   Fieldwork
              (November 1995 through October 1996) will involve primary ethnographic data 
              collection in two villages in Ghana's Central Region, via a survey of 100 women
              of varying  family and socio-economic backgrounds, involved in two different
              entrepreneurial activities,  as well as participant observation in women's
              associations and life-history development for  ten women.  The ethnographic
              research will be complemented by archival data gathering and  interviews with
              development-project administrators.  The project's potential theoretical and 
              practical contributions lie in its focus on the role of women outside the
              household and the  role of women in development activities that rely on social
              networks.
