Abstract    :
              9506494  Holloway  This research will provide data on the solubility of CO2 and
              H2O in andesitic composition melts and on the stability of hydrous minerals in
              the three prominent rock types in subducting slabs - metasediments,
              metabasalts, and hydrated peridotites.  The experiments to be conducted will
              use a combination of high pressure systems covering the range 20 Mpa to 20 Gpa.
               The solubility experiments span the temperature range 1100o to 1450o.  The
              hydrous mineral stability experiments will cover the range believed appropriate
              for subduction slab materials, generally 550o to 1200oC.  Where possible,
              experimental results will be analyzed in context of available theoretical
              models and the results applied to interpretation of subduction zone processes.
