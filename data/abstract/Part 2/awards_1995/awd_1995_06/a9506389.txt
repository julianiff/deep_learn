Abstract    :
              9506389  AveLallement   This field-based study of the tectonically active area
              of Attu island in the Aleutian volcanic arc will collect detailed data on
              recently active brittle fault populations.  The goal is to determine how to
              known oblique convergence across the Aleutian arc is partitioned into strike
              slip, thrust and extensional faults.  The results of this study will
              significantly improve our understanding of oblique collisional orogens, and
              will aid in the understanding of active plate-boundary tectonic processes.
