Abstract    :
              9506575  Fan       The Department of Statistics at the University of North
              Carolina  at Chapel Hill will purchase computer equipment which will be
              dedicated  to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The
              equipment  will be used for several research projects, including in particular
              the  following:  1. "Analyzing High-dimensional Data", by Jianqing Fan;  2.
              "Simulation and Computation in Hierarchical Modeling for  Microstructure of
              Certain Brittle  Materials", by Chuanshu Ji;  3. "Smoothing Methods in
              Interdisciplinary Work", by James Stephen  Marron; and  4. "Greedy Growing and
              Pruning of Smoothed Regression Trees", by Andrew  B. Nobel.
