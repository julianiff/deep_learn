Abstract    :
              Ductile shear zones in rocks commonly develop in three-dimensional arrays
              involving  non-plane strains and  possibly volume loss.  The purpose of this
              project is to establish the pattern  of strain and fabric development in
              ductile shear zones that form an anastomosing network in three  dimensions, to
              understand the kinematics of deformation, and to test models of shear zone
              development.  The shear zone to be studied developed in high-grade metagabbros
              of the Seve-koli nappes of the  northern Swedish Caledonides.  Preliminary
              strain analysis according to the planar band model of shear  zone development
              indicates volume loss with increasing strain, yet available geochemical data
              indicate  that deformation occurred under isochemical conditions.  The
              three-dimensional strain analysis will be  applied to the resolution of  the 
              volume loss  paradox, and a successful result will be broadly  applicable.
