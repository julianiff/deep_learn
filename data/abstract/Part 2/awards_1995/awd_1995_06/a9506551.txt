Abstract    :
              9506551  Miller   This project will test and apply a new methodology for
              estimating the U/Pb composition, and hence time of growth, of differently zoned
              areas of zircons and monazite crystals that have undergone high temperature
              metamorphism.  The technique uses a combination of cathodoluminescence and
              backscattered electron imaging and ion microprobe analysis. The methodology
              will be tested on zircons and monazites from two natural laboratories in the
              Blue Ridge of southwestern Carolina and the Old Woman Mountains area of
              southeastern California.  In addition, laboratory experiments will examine the
              controls on zircon and monazite growth kinetics.   The results of this
              combinations of field and laboratory tests will enable a clearer understanding
              of  what is being dated by U/Pb analyses of mineral zones, which will have an
              impact of tectonothermal studies of all orogenic belts.
