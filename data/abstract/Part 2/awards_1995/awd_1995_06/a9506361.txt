Abstract    :
              This proposal calls for continuation of recent advances in  atomic experiments
              designed to find and measure violations  of parity and time-reversal
              symmetries.  The researchers  plan to increase the accuracy of the parity
              violating  measurements in thallium vapor from 1% to 0.3%.  They plan  to use a
              new atomic beam method to compare several barium  isotopes as a test of the
              standard theory of electroweak  unification.  Finally, they propose a search
              for a permanent  atomic electric dipole moment (EDM).
