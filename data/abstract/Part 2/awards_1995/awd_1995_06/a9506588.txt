Abstract    :
                  9506588  Foley         This award is made under NSF's CAREER Program.  The
              principal investigator is a  young scientist who has chosen to pursue the
              challenging course of interdisciplinary research.          The research portion
              of Dr. Foley's project is focused on improving understanding of  global
              environmental systems, particularly the interface between the living biosphere
              and the  physical climate system.  Climate is of paramount importance to both
              natural and managed  ecosystems;  conversely, the terrestrial ecosystems
              significantly influence the exchange of  moisture, momentum, and energy at the
              land surface-atmosphere interface, affecting climate.   To properly investigate
              the dynamics of these interactions and to evaluate the potential impacts  of
              climate change on the system require the use of models which capture the key
              elements of  the physical and biological processes involved.  Dr. Foley seeks
              to improve the representation  of biophysical and biogeochemical processes in
              global and continental-scale ecosystem models.   This will be done by
              constructing an integrated biosphere investigation model composed of four 
              sub-models to handle surface fluxes, vegetation cover, nutrient cycling and
              hydrologic processes.         The educational portion of his project involves
              the development of new interdisciplinary  instructional materials and
              interdisciplinary courses for the undergraduate level.         The support for
              this award is shared by three divisions - Environmental Biology, Earth,  and
              Atmospheric Sciences as part of the Water and Energy:  Atmospheric, Vegetative,
              and Earth  Interactions (WEAVE) Program under Global Change.
