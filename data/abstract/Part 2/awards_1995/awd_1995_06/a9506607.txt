Abstract    :
              9506607  NI                               This research is to expand the current
              shear-wave splitting data  in the U.S. through a comprehensive analysis of S
              and SKS, shear-  wave splitting using the three-component short-period analog
              data  from the Long Range Seismic Monitoring (LRSM) network which was in  place
              during the 1960's.  This analog data, which will be digitized  and made
              available to the scientific community, presents a cost-  effective and
              spatially extensive data set which will greatly  facilitate mapping of seismic
              anisotropy across the U.S.,  effectively quadrupling the currently available
              measurements.   Shear-wave splitting is a measure of seismic anisotropy which
              can  be used to infer mantle strain associated with mantle flow and the 
              relationship between subcontinental mantle deformation and crustal 
              deformation, the driving force of earthquake occurrence.  This  research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.  ***
