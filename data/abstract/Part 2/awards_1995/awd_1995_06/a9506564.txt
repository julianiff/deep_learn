              Dissertation Improvement  Research: Effects of Glacial-Interglacial Climate
              Change on Mass Wasting, Southeastern Minnesota  This  project will investigate
              the effects of glacial-interglacial climate change on processes of hillslope 
              erosion in a part of southeastern Minnesota that was near the ice margin during
              the last glacial  period.  Study results should be applicable to a larger area
              of the Upper Mississippi Valley that is  physiographically similar.  The
              project will test the hypothesis that extensive slope erosion by mass  wasting
              was triggered by permafrost formation during the last glacial period, but that
              mass wasting  has been inactive under subsequent interglacial climatic
              conditions.  Radiocarbon dating and other  methods will be used to determine
              the chronology of past mass wasting episodes.  The results of the  study should
              enhance interpretation of large-scale changes in sediment movement and storage
              in the  Upper Mississippi basin over the past 25,000 years.     )
