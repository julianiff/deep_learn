Abstract    :
              9506778  Wilson         This award provides $28,000 as 49% of the costs of
              acquiring  two Trimble 4000SSE dual frequency geodetic receivers and 
              associated field equipment. The University of Texas at Austin will  provide 51%
              of these costs.  These two receivers will become part  of the UNAVCO pool,
              available to outside researchers for up to 6  months each year. UNAVCO
              participation provides technical and  repair support as well. The two new
              receivers will supplement two  existing UT Austin Trimble 4000SSE's currently
              available through  the UNAVCO pool for up to 3 months each year. The two
              existing  receivers were purchased and upgraded entirely with University of 
              Texas local funds. The new receivers are required to support  expanding GPS
              activities in a variety of graduate and  undergraduate educational and research
              programs at the University  of Texas within the Departments of Geological
              Sciences and  Aerospace Engineering, and through organized research units 
              including the Center for Space Research, Institute for  Geophysics, and Bureau
              of Economic Geology. The receivers will be  used in organized instructional
              activities in both undergraduate  and graduate field and geodesy courses to
              provide essential GPS  training to students in engineering and earth sciences.
              Research  applications include development of advanced GPS data processing 
              methods, monitoring of active tectonics in areas which include  the South
              Pacific and southern Rio Grande Rift, monitoring Gulf  of Mexico shoreline
              changes, and providing precise navigation for  a variety of geological and
              geophysical field programs.  ***
