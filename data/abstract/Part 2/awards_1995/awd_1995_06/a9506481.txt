Abstract    :
              9506481  Brearley  The objective of this project is to study in detail the
              mechanisms of the high pressure mantle phase transformations of the Mg2SiO4 
              and (Mg,Fe)2 SiO4  under a range of PT conditions relevant to the model mantle
              geotherm and subducting oceanic lithosphere.  The study will continue efforts
              to delineate the pressure-temperature regimes over which different
              transformation mechanisms may operate in the Earth's mantle and identify what
              factors may cause changes in the transformation mechanism.  The results have
              important geological implications for upper mantle, dynamics, especially the
              rheological behavior of subducting oceanic slabs and the mechanisms of deep
              focus earthquakes.  The project will involve high pressure kinetic experiments
              using a multi anvil high pressure apparatus coupled with detailed
              microstructural studies using optical and electron microscopy.   Special
              emphasis will be placed on the use of transmission electron microscope
              techniques, particularly electron diffraction and high resolution electron
              microscopy to elucidate the transformation mechanisms.
