Abstract    :
                  9506855  Wray    Enormous strides have been made recently towards
              understanding the  molecular genetic basis for body pattern development in
              animals.  With the breakthroughs, however, have come new questions. In 
              particular, the expression of many patterning genes is remarkably  conserved
              among morphologically distinct animals. Dr. Wray proposes  to examine the
              expression, function, and evolution of several  patterning genes in
              echinoderms, a phylum with a highly modified,  radial body organization. His
              analysis will focus on genes whose  expression is conserved in insects and
              vertebrates, but likely to  be modified in radial animals. He will first
              characterize their  timing, spatial domains, and transcript sizes. Genes
              expressed  during radial body development will be selected for a detailed 
              comparative analysis among phylogenetically diverse echinoderms.  These data
              will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of  expression changes
              during the origin and diversification of the  phylum. He will manipulate the
              timing of adult development using  environmental cues to test the hypothesis
              that the timing of  patterning gene expression in this phylum is not
              "hardwired".  Together, these studies will ad d considerably to our
              understanding  of the developmental and evolutionary significance of genes with
               roles in body patterning.  ***
