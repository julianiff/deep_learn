Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Anthony Marks and his colleagues
              will continue archaeological work in the Crimea. Research to date has yielded
              rich assemblages of Middle Paleolithic industries at several sites. These
              contain with preserved faunal remains and the team will now conduct detailed
              studies of these. They will analyze these materials both to reconstruct the
              environments in which Middle Paleolithic peoples lived and how they changed
              over time. Faunal remains also provide information on how people utilize
              resources and thus the study will provide insight into environmental stimulus
              and human response.   Middle Paleolithic peoples are the immediate predecessors
              of anatomically modern humans who appeared in Europe about 40,000 years ago. In
              the attempt to understand these later adaptations, the Middle Paleolithic
              provides a benchmark and it is through an understanding of `not quite fully
              human` behavior that the unique behavioral adaptations which characterize our
              own subspecies can best be understood. Dr. Marks work to date indicates that
              these earlier adaptations are more complex than archaeologists had expected and
              that groups adapted in distinct and specific ways over very limited geographic
              distances.  This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new
              light on how prehistoric peoples adapted to their environments and will provide
              data of interest to many archaeologists.
