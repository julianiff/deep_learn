              NCR-9506681  William Marsh Rice University  Algorithms and Architectures for
              Channel Estimation and  Multiuser Detection in CDMA Communication System 
              Behnaam Aazhang and Joseph R. Cavallaro    There are three major problems in
              using multiuser detection for the next  generation cellular CDMA networks: 
              estimation of the signal and channel  parameters, real-time hardware
              implementation of multiuser estimation and  detection algorithms, and system
              adaption to changes in the network. This  project addresses the development and
              concurrent implementation of  algorithms for channel estimation and data
              detection in a multiuser  environment. The objective is to find computationally
              efficient algorithms  that are near-far resistant, are capable of tracking
              slowly varying  channels, and can be extended to systems with antenna arrays. 
              An integral  part of the project is the implementation of these algorithms. 
              The mapping  of the algorithms onto parallel architectures, particularly using
              standard  DSP processors in combination with custom VLSI co-processors will be 
              studied.  The project combines developments in multiuser communications  with
              developments in DSP and VLSI to provide practical solutions for  problems in
              CDMA communications.
