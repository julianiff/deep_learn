Abstract    :
              9506627  Karlstrom           This award provides funds for a workshop to bring
              together  investigators from diverse subdisciplines in geology and geophysics 
              to discuss and synthesize models for the structure and evolution of  the
              lithosphere in western North America.  The main goal of the  workshop is to
              coordinate and facilitate interaction between  workers from different subfields
              who are investigating lithospheric  evolution of two closely related and
              intersecting transects: (1)   the Rocky Mountain transect from Wyoming to
              Mexico, and (2) the  Arizona Transition Zone transect.  ***
