Abstract    :
              9506677  Bilham      The PIs will measure the rate of convergence of India
              towards Asia,  and determine the style of elastic and inelastic deformation 
              resulting from this continent-continent collision.  They will  measure both the
              partitioning of deformation among the various  elements of the plate collision
              zone, and also the detailed pattern  of deformation associated with most of the
              significant elements.   The PIs will reoccupy about 80 GPS sites that were
              surveyed  precisely either 4 years (Nepal and southern Tibet) or 3 years 
              (northern India) ago.  They will also install a few new sites.   This
              occupation will permit a measure of the relative velocities of  the sites,
              permitting the first measurement of the tectonic motions  across the entire
              plate boundary.  These measurements will improve  our understanding of the rate
              of vertical deformation that sustains  the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau,
              and indirectly controls  global atmospheric circulation.  ****
