Abstract    :
              9506683  Tackley      The PI will perform a numerical modeling study in global
              dynamics,  with the aim of implementing a model of plate tectonics into 
              numerical convection code, incorporating geochemical aspects into  the code,
              studying the Earth's thermo-chemical evolution in the  light of phase
              transitions, chemical differentiation and mixing,  and plate tectonics, using a
              wide range of observations to  constrain the model parameters.  The PI will use
              large-scale 3-D  numerical simulations on parallel supercomputers, analytical 
              analyses, parameterized thermo-chemical history models, and  interdisciplinary
              comparisons between results and observations.  ***
