Abstract    :
                  This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of Chemistry at George Washington University acquire a Phase-Doppler
              Particle Analyzer.  The research activity to be supported includes: (1)
              investigation of novel nebulization systems and high-temperature helium plasmas
              in analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis, (2) investigation of plumes
              generated by laser ablation from metals, insulators, and high-transition
              temperature superconductors, (3) investigations of the production and
              monitoring of pollutants in diffusion flames, an area of interest for the gas
              industry, (4) development of efficient practical high-order computational
              methods for the simulation of physical phenomena described by unsteady
              nonlinear three-dimensional partial differential equations.    A Fourier
              transform mass spectrometer is capable of extremely high mass-resolution and is
              used to measure the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion.  It may also
              be used to obtain highly detailed information about ion molecule reactions in
              the gas phase.  This information may be used to help determine the atomic
              composition and, sometimes, the molecular geometry of a molecule.
