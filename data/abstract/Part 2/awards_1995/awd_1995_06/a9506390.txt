Abstract    :
              Chan  9506390   The isotope geochemistry of lithium in the continental
              environments is virtually unknown.  The proposed research is intended to
              examine the behavior of lithium and its two isotopes 6Li and 7Li in brines and
              waters which reside in a  large part of the continental crust.  Three major
              types of crustal fluids will be studied:  subsurface brines in sedimentary
              basins, deep seated brines saturating Archean Shields, and continental
              geothermal fluids.  Representative examples to be included in this project are
              the Jordon Rift and oil field brines of Israel, saline waters from the Canadian
              and Fennoscandian shields and the geothermal waters from the Yellowstone
              system.  The objectives are (1) to establish the lithium isotope composition of
              brines and thermal waters from various environments and of their associated
              rocks and sediments, (2) to determine element distribution coefficient and
              isotope fractionation factors by laboratory simulation of water/rock
              interaction, and (3) to apply the findings to model the origin and evolution of
              the crustal fluids.  Special emphasis will be given to the cause of salinity
              and the calcium chloridic composition of the brines which remains a subject of
              considerable debate. Li isotope systematics will be compared to the more 
              established isotope tracers, 87Sr/86Sr and 34S/32S.  In addition, all waters
              will be analyzed for the major and minor constituents (N, K, Ca, Mg, Sr, Li,
              Cl, SO4, HCO3, and NO3) for an integrated interpretation of the nature of the
              parent fluid and the effects of interactive processes with the host rock.  This
              work will be in collaboration with Dr. A. Katz of Hebrew University, Jerusalem.
                The significance of the proposed research lies in the establishment of a new
              isotope system for the study of continental crustal waters.  At the same time,
              it will leas to a considerable enlargement of reliable lithium isotope data and
              contribute to the fundamental understanding of the isotope geochemistry of
              lithium.  The study of continental mat erial will complement the recent marine
              studies to offer a more comprehensive view of the terrestrial variation of
              lithium isotopes.
