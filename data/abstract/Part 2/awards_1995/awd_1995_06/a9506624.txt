Abstract    :
              This objective of this research is to develop a computational framework for
              behavior modeling adapted  to the problem of creating complex scenarios in
              large-scale virtual environments.  The project will  develop a modeling system
              based on hierarchical, concurrent state machines that supports the control  of
              reactive behaviors and provides mechanisms for coordinating behaviors to create
              critical situations  and events.  A second research thrust is to create
              authoring tools to facilitate the design of virtual  environments and the
              definition of scenarios in which computer generated agents play central roles. 
              This technology has application in interactive, real-time simulation
              environments such as vehicle  simulation for driver training, virtual
              prototyping, and experimental studies of driving safety that  require dynamic
              situations and circumstances to be reproduced across trials without overly
              restricting  subject's actions and while maintaining diversity, responsiveness,
              and spontaneity in agent behaviors.
