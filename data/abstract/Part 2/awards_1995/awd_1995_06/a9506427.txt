Abstract    :
              9506427  Hager      The PI will develop and use global flow models to test
              geodynamical  hypotheses, including compositional stratification of the mantle,
               the relation between seismic tomographic models and  temperature/composition,
              the driving mechanism for plate motions  and its relation to mantle
              heterogeneity, the origin of sea level  variations, and the evolution of deep
              continental structure.  These  models will be tested against observed seismic
              and gravity data.  ****
