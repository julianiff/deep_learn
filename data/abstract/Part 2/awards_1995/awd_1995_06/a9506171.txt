Abstract    :
              The award supports planning and initial development of a  database and
              associated tools for developing a database of  identified neurons for molluscs.
              The database will serve two  communities of neurobiologists. For molluscan 
              neuroscientists, the goal is a database containing  descriptions of identified
              and identifiable neurons, actual  datasets of neurophysiological data from both
              identified  cells and candidates for neuronal identification, and model 
              parameters useful for electrophysiological simulations of  neurons and
              networks. For the wider community of  neurophysiologists, the goal is a
              generalizable set of  annotated data structures for storage, classification, 
              query, and distribution of neurophysiological data from many  species and
              techniques. An ancillary goal for both  communities is the development of
              user-friendly graphical  tools for data entry and viewing and database query.
              Project  development is headed by a molluscan neurobiologist with  extensive
              software development experience, coordinated with  an academic multiplatform
              software developer with  significant research experience in identified neurons.
              All  phases of the project will be coordinated with user feedback  from a broad
              representation of the molluscan community, as  well as from neurophysiologists
              using other invertebrate and  mammalian species. To further serve the
              neuroscience  communities, database access, as well as user tools and data 
              type specifications developed by the project, will be  provided freely.
