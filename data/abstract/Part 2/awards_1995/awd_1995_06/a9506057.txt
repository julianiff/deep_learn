Abstract    :
                PI: Okikiolu  DMS-9506057    Okikiolu will investigate the connection between
              zeta-regularized determinants of certain elliptic operators on a manifold with
              boundary and certain Toeplitz determinants on the boundary.  She has proved a
              Campbell-Hausdorff formula for elliptic operators and a related trace formula,
              and developed new methods for symbolic computation.  She will now extend these
              results to manifolds with boundary.  Okikiolu also has proved an analogue of
              the strong Szego limit theorem for spheres of dimension two and three, and will
              further generalize this result.    Partial differential equations form a basis
              for mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical
              analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide
              qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions.  This may include
              answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition,
              analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on
               the accuracy of these approximations.
