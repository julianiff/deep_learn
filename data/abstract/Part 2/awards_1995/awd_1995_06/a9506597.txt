Abstract    :
              9506597  Newsom  This project will use the fluid/sediment sensitive siderophile
              trace elements Pb, As, Sb, as well as the fluid sensitive trace element B, to
              examine the variations in lava chemistry from arc transects in selected oceanic
              and continental arcs, and from volcanoes east and west of the Quesado Sharp
              Contortion (QSC) in north-central Costa Rica.  Complementary data will be
              collected from samples derived from the mantle, including Mid-Ocean-Ridge
              Basalts (MORB) from depleted mantle, Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) from enriched
              mantle, and rift and flood basalts (including samples for Franz Josef Land,
              Russia) from the asthenosphere and continental lithosphere.  The concentrations
              of Pb, As, Sb and other siderophile elements will be determined by Inductively
              Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (CP-MS) at the University of New Mexico, while
              B, Be and Li data will be obtained by our collaborators.  The enrichments of
              Pb, As, Sb, and B in volcanic arcs and the continental crust can not be
              attributed to igneous fractionation alone based on inferred partitioning
              between mantle minerals and basaltic melts.  These enrichments can, however, be
              attributed to the addition of a fluid/sediment subduction component to the
              magma source region.  The enrichments provide an important signature of the
              involvement of subduction zone volcanism in the formation of the continental
              crust.
