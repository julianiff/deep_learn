Abstract    :
              9506048  Lam       During the course of this project, the principal investigator
               will investigate the design and performance of a new class of  packet
              switching networks, called Burst Scheduling networks, for  supporting
              multimedia applications.  Burst Scheduling networks are  designed for carrying
              video, audio, and data traffic, and  characterized by: (i) use of virtual clock
              values in channel  scheduling, (ii) packet flows (in particular, video flows) 
              processed efficiently in bursts, and (iii) delay and delay jitter   guarantees
              provided to packet flows that satisfy a Flow  Specification (a new model of
              packet video motivated by our recent  study of MPEG video).       The primary
              objective of the proposed project is to  investigate network design issues,
              such as, statistical versus  deterministic performance guarantees, demand
              assignment strategies,  efficient scheduling algorithms, fault-tolerant
              architecture and  protocols, modeling of audio and delay-sensitive data
              traffic, flow  control and buffer management strategies.  The secondary
              objective  of the proposed project is to investigate the design and 
              prototyping of a transport protocol that makes use of performance  guarantees
              provided by Burst Scheduling networks to support  multimedia applications.     
               Some of the proposed research problems will be investigated  using
              mathematical methods.  All of the research problems will be  investigated
              experimentally in the Networking Research Laboratory  of the Department of
              Computer Sciences.  Specifically, we plan to  add capabilities to a simulator
              of Burst Scheduling networks to  enable the proposed research activities.  The
              simulator will be run  on a high-performance workstation and will be connected
              to other  workstations where the prototype transport protocol and a real 
              multimedia application will be run, supplying video, audio, and  data flows to
              the simulator.  ***      *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking
