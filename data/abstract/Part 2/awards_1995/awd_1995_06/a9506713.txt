Abstract    :
              9506713  Shirey  This proposal requests support to continue application of the
              Re-Os isotopic system to a wide range of problems concerning crust-mantle-core
              differentiation on the Earth.  With the funding requested in this proposal we
              hope to address the following topics:  1) the mechanisms of formation of
              continental lithospheric mantle, focusing especially on across-craton
              variability, addition of lithospheric material at craton margins and the
              implications for Archean and Proterozoic tectonics; 2) secular changes in the
              Os isotopic composition of the convecting mantle that may reveal if the mantle
              records the effects of a) changing ratios of oceanic to continental crust
              production through time, b) decline in extraterrestrial input of PGE's to the
              mantle during early Earth history and c) mass exchange between core and mantle,
              and 3) Os isotopic characterization o lower crustal xenoliths to determine
              their initial mantle extraction ages in order to evaluate the significance of
              magmatic underplating as opposed to continental collision in thickening
              continental crust.  These studies all make use of the unique characteristics of
              the Re-Os isotopic system that when used in conjunction with Sr, Nd, and Pb
              isotopic data offers the potential of new insights into the chronological,
              tectonic, and chemical evolution of the solid earth.
