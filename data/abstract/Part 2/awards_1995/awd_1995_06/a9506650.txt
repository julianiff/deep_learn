Abstract    :
              9506650  Anderson   This award provides partial funding for the development of 
              a dilatometer to measure the thermal expansion of crystals up to temperatures
              of 1800K. The instrument design is based on the application of laser optical
              interferometry, and a prototype built in the principal investigator's
              laboratory has demonstrated capabilities up to 1000K. Upgrading the design for
              performance at higher temperatures is important because the main applications
              of the instrument will be to characterize the thermal expansion coefficients of
               mineral phases stable under the high-temperature conditions of the Earth's
              crust and upper mantle.  ***
