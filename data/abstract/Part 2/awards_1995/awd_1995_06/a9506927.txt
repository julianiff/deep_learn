Abstract    :
              IBN#9506927  Wakimoto    The overall aim of this proposal is to identify
              products of  paternal origin that are required for early embryogenesis in 
              Drosophila melangaster.  This proposal concentrates on three genes,  the
              sneaky, paternal loss and ms(3)K81 genes.  Mutations of these  genes act as
              paternal effect mutations that cause defects in  development within minutes
              after entry of the sperm into the egg.   These mutations will be used to
              identify the molecules required for  normal response of the sperm to the egg
              cytoplasm, for syngamy and  for stable maintenance of the paternal chromosomes
              in the zygote.   The RNA and protein products of these genes will be identified
              and  their subcellular distribution during spermatogenesis and  embryogenesis
              will be determined.  To study the function of these  products, the consequences
              of mutations that alter the level or  distribution of the snky, pal and K81
              products will be analyzed.   Mutant transgenes designed to test the function of
              specific domains  of the RNA or protein products will be constructed in vitro
              and  introduced into flies by germ line transformation.  New snky  mutations
              will be isolated and genetically characterized.  These  studies should
              contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of  the differences between
              the paternal and maternal contributions and  the regulation of the events that
              ensure their successful union  during the earliest stages of embryogenesis.
