Abstract    :
              9506470   Burgmann   This project will characterize the important vertical
              motions associated with the San Andreas transform fault system in the San
              Francisco Bay area. Current estimates of the amount of shortening and uplift
              associated with the fault in the San Francisco Bay area vary by up to an order
              of magnitude. An integrated study of fission track, geomorphic, geodetic and
              fault system modeling analysis will quantify the intense recent contraction and
              uplift. The data will be used to assess the importance of zones of intense
              vertical motions along faults and will be used to calibrate qualitative
              geomorphic indicators of uplift and fault movement with quantitative uplift
              magnitudes derived from fission track data and measured historic uplift
              patterns. The results will be of importance to all tectonically active regions
              of the world.
