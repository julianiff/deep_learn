Abstract    :
              9506853  Kissel       This joint collaborative effort between American and
              Soviet  scientists is to develop simple analytic models to describe the 
              dynamic properties of electrons in electric fields, and the  dynamic
              polarizability of Rydberg states.  The results will be  applied to experiments
              using trapped ions.  ***
