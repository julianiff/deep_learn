Abstract    :
              This award supports research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry. One
              direction of this research involves the l-adic cohomology of varieties over
              finite fields, the l-adic theory of exponential sums over finite fields, the
              arithmetic theory of differential equations, Fourier transforms (both l-adic
              and for D-modules), the theory of perverse sheaves, and the relations among
              them. The remainder of the project centers around the conjectures about special
              values of L-functions attached to varieties over number fields.     The
              mathematical area of arithmetic algebraic geometry is an ultramodern research
              area which combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory
              and geometry. The new insights arising out of this combination are producing
              increasingly powerful tools to solve long-standing problems like Fermat's Last
              Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of
              mathematicians. In addition, though arithmetic geometry is sometimes regarded
              as among the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful
              new techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as
              error-correcting codes and cryptography.
