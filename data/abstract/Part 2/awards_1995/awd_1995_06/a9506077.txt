Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9506077  Meneveau  Johns Hopkins University    The Department of
              Mechanical Engineering at The Johns Hopkins University will purchase a high
              performance computing, communications and visualization system which will be
              dedicated to research on complex fluid-thermal processes.  The equipment
              requested consists of a high-speed computer and one graphics workstation for
              3-D visualization and animation, linked together and connected to laboratories
              by a high-speed fiber network.  This equipment will (I) allow processing of
              extensive mulit-dimensional laboratory data, (ii) provide computing power
              necessary to perform large-scale numerical simulations, and (iii) compare and
              integrate large computational and experimental data sets.  This will have a
              significant impact on the following projects: (a) Analysis of small-scale
              models for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow, where massive experimental
              data sets are analyzed to study unsolved problems in the modeling of
              subgrid-scales.  (b) Study of generation mechanisms of small bubbles, where a
              new method of producing tiny bubbles at high rates is investigated
              experimentally and theoretically.  (c) Thermoacoustic refrigeration, where heat
              flow is driven by acoustic energy.  This study - experimental, computational,
              and analytical - addresses the factors limiting the efficiency of present
              systems.
