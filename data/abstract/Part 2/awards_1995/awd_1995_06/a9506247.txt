Abstract    :
                This project involves a cultural anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University
              in an ethnographic study of decollectivization -- changing private property
              rights  -- in one Transylvanian community of Romania.  The project will examine
              how decollectivization affects people's fundamental relations with state
              authorities and institutions.  The researcher will observe and examine court
              cases, interview villagers, local authorities, judges and lawyers and
              government officials, observe the work of the village Land Commission, and
              consult archives and local print media.  These methods will produce a detailed
              picture of how property restitution is taking place, what sorts of property
              rights are being created, and how villagers are developing new concepts of
              themselves as citizens and property-holders in relation to the land and the
              state.    This research is important because the changing societies of Eastern
              Europe often lead observers to assume that the societies are simply becoming
              more `democratic` in the sense of imitating Western capitalism.  The reality is
              that the histories of each place constrain the distribution of power and
              privilege, and limit access to justice and civil rights by different groups. 
              Research which provides a rich case study of one community evolving a new
              relation between democracy and private property will advance our understanding
              of the general principles involved.
