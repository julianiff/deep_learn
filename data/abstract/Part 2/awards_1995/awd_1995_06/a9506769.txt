Abstract    :
              Recent hypotheses suggest that the breakup of a single supercontinent at about
              750 Ma  has led to the origin of several independent continents now widely
              scattered over the earth.  It poses  testable models for identifying the former
              extent and connections of these continents and gives new  meaning to previously
              identified intercontinental (eg. Pan-African/Brasiliano and Grevillian/Kibaran)
               orogenic systems.  The work will focus on a unique triple junction exposed in
              the Namib Desert on the  coastal escarpment of northern Namibia.  This key
              locations is near the center of the hypothesized  supercontinent.  The initial
              focus of the project is on the foreland thrust and fold belts of the  southern
              and western Congo margins , involving sequences related to rifting,
              passive-margin  subsidence, terrane accretion and terminal collision.  Pesults
              will provide essential data to  reconstruct the tectonic history of this area
              and to allow a rigorous test of the hypothesis that  these events are part of a
              supercontinent breakup that has led to the present distribution of  continental
              crust.
