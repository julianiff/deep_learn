Abstract    :
              9506708  SONG                             This research is to model recordings
              of seismic waves travelling  through the earth's core to recover its detailed
              structure.  The  inner core, from earlier work, is confirmed to be anisotropic,
               possessing a cylindrical symmetry around the earth spin axis with  the N-S
              direction 3% faster in P-wave velocity than the E-W  direction.  The very top
              60 km of the inner core appears not to be  anisotropic with the interval from
              60 to 150 km being a transition  region.  Several questions remain including
              the details of the  anisotropy and the nature of the isotropic region near the
              inner  core boundary.  The theoretically possible, but undetected, phase  PKJKP
              will be sought again in light of the new information on  anisotropy.  The
              answer to these questions bear on the nature of  the earth's magnetic field,
              and the composition and physics of the  core's material.  ***
