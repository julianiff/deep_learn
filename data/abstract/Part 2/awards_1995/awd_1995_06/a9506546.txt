Abstract    :
              9506546  Williams   This project will refine and test a completely new method
              for dating metamorphic staurolite and other minerals in complexly metamorphosed
              regions, and will apply the method to the metamorphic rocks of the Southwestern
              U.S.  U-Pb dating of a suite of metamorphic minerals will be conducted in
              concert with detailed porphyroblast-matrix studies, field structural analyses
              and metamorphic pressure-temperature studies to unravel the complex tectonic
              history of the middle crust of New Mexico, Arizona and the Colorado Front Range
              during continental assembly.  The results will be of great significance to
              workers in complex tectono-metamorphic terranes and will have far-reaching
              consequences for the understanding of tectonic events in all orogenic belts.
