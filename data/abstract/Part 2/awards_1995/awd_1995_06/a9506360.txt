Abstract    :
              9506360  Zimmerman    Essentially nothing is known about the molecular
              mechanisms nor the  genes involved in regulating differentiation and
              morphogenesis  during early embryogenesis in higher plants. This proposal 
              describes the molecular and genetic analysis on one of the earliest  stages of
              embryogenesis, the globular stage, Dr. Zimmerman has  chosen this stage because
              it is during the globular stage that all  of the basic tissue systems of the
              mature plant are initiated and  the primary meristems are established. She has
              identified two  globular defective Arabidopsis mutants that show interesting 
              defects in development during the globular stage. One of these  mutants may
              exhibit a homeotic transformation of one embryo cell  type to another, and the
              other mutant shows defects in tissue  organization and the transition to
              polarized growth. Each of these  mutations appears to be caused by T-DNA
              insertion, and hence the  genes of interest should be tagged; indeed, Dr.
              Zimmerman has  already cloned one of the genes using T-DNA as a probe. She will
               use these mutants to address fundamental questions regarding the  molecular
              basis for cellular identity, tissue differentiation and  organization in plant
              embryogenesis. In order to begin to address  these questions, she will 1)
              characterize the phenotype and timing  of developmental interference in each
              mutant, 2) genetically map  the mutations relative to known chromosomal markers
              and relative to  other embryo defective genes, and in the longer term, 3)
              isolate  and characterize the tagged genes responsible for the mutations in 
              order to evaluate the molecular and developmental consequences of  these
              mutations.  ***
