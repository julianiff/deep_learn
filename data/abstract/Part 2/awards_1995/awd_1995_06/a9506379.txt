Abstract    :
              9506379  CHRISTENSEN    This research is to develop and apply the Composite
              Distribution  Inversion technique to tomographic inversion of seismic data in 
              volcanologic and engineering tomography problems.  The engineering  application
              involves tunnel detection between two lines of  boreholes.  The volcanologic
              test will be to image magma chambers  under the Redoubt volcano.  Both problems
              provide excellent three-  dimensional anomaly detection objectives which should
              benefit  greatly from the reduced signal smearing of this technique.  One of 
              the products of the research will be a publicly available three-  dimensional
              tomography program which properly handles topography  and three-dimensional
              ray-tracing problems typical of those in  areas of rugged terrain.  The
              improved tomographic technique should  prove useful in earthquake and volcano
              hazard estimation work.   This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
