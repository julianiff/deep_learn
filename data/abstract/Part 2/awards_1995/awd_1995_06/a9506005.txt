Abstract    :
              SBR-9506005  This dissertation-improvement award provides field equipment and
              assistance for the  Student's research into demographic, environmental, and
              social change in Malawi since the  late 19th century.  The theoretical argument
              is that the outcome variation from interactions of  particular demographic and
              natural-resource situations is amenable to historical explanation.  The central
              hypothesis, that a confluence of demographic and institutional changes in the 
              late-19th century provided the basis for current resource scarcity in modern
              Malawi, will be  explored via a three-part research design:  a social survey,
              historical research, and  environmental analyses.  There are two research
              sites, one in southern Malawi (the Zomba  district) and one in central Malawi
              (the Kasungu district).  Field research is to be undertaken  from August 1995
              through July 1996.  The research seeks to advance population and  resource
              theory by bridging the Malthusian focus on demographic demand on ecosystems and
               the Boserupian focus on social and institutional determinants of resource use
              and supply.
