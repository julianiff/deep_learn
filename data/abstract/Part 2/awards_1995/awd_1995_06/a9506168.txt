Abstract    :
              This proposal is for support of students and young  scientists to travel to the
              XIXth International Conference  on the Physics of Electronic and Atomic
              Collisions (ICPEAC)  in Whistler, Canada, July 26 - August 1, 1995.  Support is
               limited to those U.S. scientists who are students or hold  junior research
              positions in an academic, governmental, or  industrial institution.  This
              series of conferences was  initiated in 1958, soon achieved international
              standing, and  later was recognized by the International Union of Pure and 
              Applied Physics.  The conference is a prime vehicle for  international
              communication among scientists working in the  field of atomic, ionic and
              electronic collisions.  This  conference offers opportunities for students and
              young  scientists to interact with senior scientists from around  the world.
