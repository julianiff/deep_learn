Abstract    :
              9506517  Jacobsen  The compositional variation of the present-day mantle results
              from a number of crust-mantle and intra-mantle differentiation processes
              operating over geologic time.  Some of these ancient processes many have been
              markedly different from those occurring today.  The production of continental
              crust has had the greatest influence in establishing the composition of the
              present-day mantle, but exactly how and when this occurred is controversial. 
              It is proposed to conduct a series of high quality geochemical measurements of
              modern and ancient mafic to ultramafic lavas and their melt inclusions that
              will yield new insights into the secular evolution in the composition of the
              mantle.  Foremost among these studies will be the use of microbeam techniques
              on olivine-hosted melt inclusions in ancient lavas to determine the
              compositional characteristics of the primary lavas and their source regions. 
              Komatiitic samples containing olivine-hosted melt inclusions from widely
              varying temporal and spatial associations will be investigated.  These
              microbeam techniques will also be applied to determine the compositions of
              glassy portions of modern oceanic basalts in order to establish variations in
              "constant ratios" of incompatible elements in the lavas and their source
              regions.  Characterizing the secular evolution of the composition of the mantle
              will lead to a enhanced understanding of crust-mantle and intra-mantle
              differentiation processes and the rate at which they occurred.
