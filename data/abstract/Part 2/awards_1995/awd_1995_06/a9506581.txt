Abstract    :
              9506581  Karato      The PI will perform mechanical property experiments on
              minerals  that exist in the transition zone and lower mantle of Earth, and 
              analogues of those materials.  He will study the strengths of lower  mantle and
              transition zone minerals using their relative strengths  as generated from the
              non-hydrostatic stress state in high pressure  apparatus, and from a further
              study of analogue materials that have  similar structures to the real minerals
              at lower pressures.  He  will also investigate the effects of grain size
              reduction on  rheology with application to grain fining due to phase
              transitions  within slabs at depth in the Earth.  ****
