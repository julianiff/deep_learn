Abstract    :
              9506505  Yates       This research looks to extend the application of power
              control  in mobile cellular communications to multihop CDMA packet radio 
              networks.  Using soft interference constraints derived from signal  to
              interference ratio measurements, distributed power control  algorithms will be
              studied which adapt to changes in the radio link  quality, actively regulate
              the network topology, achieve desired  end-to-end throughput objectives, and
              integrate power control and  multihop routing.  ***
