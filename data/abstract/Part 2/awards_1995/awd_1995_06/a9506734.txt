Abstract    :
              9506734  Linde    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Alan Linde, 
              Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, the Carnegie Institute  of Washington and
              Dr. I. Furuya, Seismology and Volcanology  Research Department, Japan
              Meteorological Research  Institute. Project funding will enable Dr. Linde to
              spend  twelve months in Japan, resident at the Japan Meteorological  Research
              Institute, in order to study crustal deformation  data recorded by a network of
              borehole strainmeters  operating in south-east Honshu, Japan. Close
              collaboration  with scientists at the Japan Meteorological Research  Institute
              will allow combined studies of these unique data  sets for several different
              tectonically active regions. Such  studies are expected to yield new insights
              into these major  tectonic processes.    This proposal brings together research
              scientists from two  countries working in the area of volcanic eruptions and 
              earthquakes. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to  become familiar
              with research techniques, data, equipment,  and facilities at the Japan
              Meteorological Research  Institute while contributing to the overall research
              effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in
              its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
