Abstract    :
                    9506435  Frangopol  The essential objective of this project is to develop
              a new  method  for life-cycle reliability-based multicriteria evaluation  and 
              design of structural systems under serviceability, ultimate,  and 
              time-dependent deterioration requirements imposed  simultaneously. 
              State-of-the-art time-dependent structural reliability  methods will  be used
              in this research.  Efficient and effective  techniques of  combining
              multicriteria mathematical programming with time-  dependent system reliability
              framework will also be  developed.  Successful completion of this project will
              result in the  possibility to evaluate and design civil engineering  systems, 
              including reliability constraints, by considering life-cycle  deterioration
              effects.
