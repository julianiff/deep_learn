Abstract    :
              This award supports a joint U.S.-Italian symposium, `Glucose-6-phosphate
              Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Diet, and Adaptation to Malaria,` to be held in
              Cortona, Italy, July 3 - 5, 1995, under the auspices of the Congress of the
              International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.  The
              organizers of the symposium are Lawrence S. Greene of the University of
              Massachusetts, Boston, and Maria Danubio, University of L'Aquila, in Italy. 
              The proposal will fund the attendance of six U.S. investigators at the
              symposium.    The symposium will focus on :  molecular variability at the G6PD
              locus; the biochemistry of favism; antimalarial action of the favic compounds
              and other oxidant substances of plant origin; the interaction of G6PD
              deficiency and dietary oxidants in providing antimalarial protection;
              distribution of alleles for G6PD deficiency in Sardinia and its relationship to
              altitude and past malarial history.    The Italian side will be represented by
              15 Italian investigators and several other international scholars.  The
              Italians are world leaders in the study of  G6PD deficiency in adaptation to
              falciparum malaria.  The Americans will contribute their unique perspective on
              how biocultural adaptation has operated at the G6PD locus.
