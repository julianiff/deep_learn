Abstract    :
              Dr. John E. Bercaw, Chemistry Department, California Institute of    
              Technology, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for synthetic,   structural, and
              mechanistic investigations of early transition metal   complexes having
              reactive ligands. A series of Lewis acidic group 4 and 5   metal complexes
              which contain adjacent Lewis base sites contained in   coordinated ligands will
              be prepared. Because of the amphoteric nature of   these compounds new pathways
              for the activation of H-X sigma bonds will   be opened and the oxidation state
              of the metal can be adjusted through   the control of pH. The mechanisms of new
              reaction types will be   determined and comparisons will be made with the more
              usual bent sandwich   analogues of the metals.  Catalysts based on transition
              metal compounds are used extensively in the   chemical industry and important
              new developments in organo-transition   metal chemistry often center on the
              development of new catalysts or on   the optimization of existing ones. The
              objective of this research is to   prepare and structurally characterize new
              types of early transition-metal   compounds that contain `non-innocent` groups
              attached to the metal. These   groups, called ligands, will bear reactive sites
              that will allow the   behavior of the transition metal to be altered in novel,
              systematic ways.   The new compounds should activate bonds involving hydrogen
              and may   catalyze olefin polymerization. The ultimate goal is to develop
              catalysts   to selectively transform readily available substances such as  
              hydrocarbons, water, and ammonia into more valuable products.
