Abstract    :
              9506371  Birkeland   This project will conduct mapping and trenching studies of
              antislope bedrock scarps on the arests and flanks of mountain ridges, to find
              diagnostic criteria to distinguish between seismic and non-seismic origins of
              these features. The origins of antislope scarps are presently disputed and this
              project will test the hypothesis that creep-generated scarps display folded
              stratigraphy whereas earthquake-generated scarps display colluvial wedge
              stratigraphy with subsidiary fractures. Field work will analyze bedrock scarps
              of known seismic and known non-seismic origin. The results of this work will
              provide significant new information about the seismic hazard potential of
              antislope scarps in actively deforming tectonic regions.
