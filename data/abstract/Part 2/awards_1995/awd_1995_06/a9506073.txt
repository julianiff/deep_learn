Abstract    :
              9506073  Mukherjee    The objective of this grant is to explore the feasibility 
              of laser-assisted, die-less superplastic forming.  Computer 
              numerically-controlled laser energy is applied to a sheet  of superplastic
              alloy under a hydrostatic pressure to  develop a desired concave or convex
              "bulge".  The position,  shape, and the amount of displacement in a given area
              is  controlled by the local laser energy coupling aided by the  computer
              controlled motion of the assembly.  This motion of  the assembly (or the laser
              beam) is based on a finite  element prediction of thermal and displacement
              parameter  mapping.  Microstructure and strain-rate sensitivity  parameters are
              taken into consideration  for the analysis.  The proposed research is a
              collaborative effort between  three faculty members with experience in the
              necessary  areas of expertise required for this study: laser  processing,
              superplastic deformation, and finite element  analysis.  %%%  This program is
              the first comprehensive investigation of a  new laser-materials processing
              technology on die-less  superplastic forming.  The combination of studies with 
              application of computers for laser processing, superplastic  deformation,
              finite element analysis, microstructure and  strain-rate sensitivity will
              produce an innovative forming  process.  ***    KEYWORDS:  Superplastic
              forming; laser-assisted  deformation; modeling.    MATERIALS:  Aluminum alloys.
