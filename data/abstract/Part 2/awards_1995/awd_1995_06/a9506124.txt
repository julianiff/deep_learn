Abstract    :
              This research  will focus on  interactions of   phosphatidylinositol-specific
              phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and   sphingomyelinase with various lipid membrane
              systems.  The major points   to be addressed are the mechanisms of action of
              these enzymes, substrate   specificities, the way in which the enzymes interact
              with lipid surfaces   and the nature of activation by the lipid interface.   
              With this RUI award the Biophysics Program is supporting the research of   Dr.
              Gary O. Spessard of the Department of Chemistry at St. Olaf College.   
              Professor Spessard will focus his work on understanding the interactions   of
              enzymes with lipid substrates at an interface.  The research will   study the
              recognition processes, the mechanisms for enzyme binding at an   interface, the
              activation processes at the interface, the regulation of   enzyme activity and
              the mechanism of catalysis.
