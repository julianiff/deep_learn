Abstract    :
              9506784  Engler   Ssm1(strain-specific modifier) is a locus on distal mouse
              chromosome 4 that controls the methylation of a class of transgenic targets and
              presumably endogenous sequences as well.  Because any detailed understanding of
              how Ssm1 functions depends upon cloning the gene, the first goal of this
              project is to isolate the murine Ssm1 locus using positional cloning
              techniques. A high resolution genetic map of  the involved region will be made
              in order to specifically locate the locus. Clones from existing libraries will
              be analyzed in order to identify the region of DNA containing the gene.  A
              second goal is to characterize specific targets of the Ssm1 modifier locus and
              efforts will begin to isolate endogenous sequences whose methylation might be
              controlled by Ssm1. A third aim is to identify any other genes which might be
              required in addition to Ssm1 for methylation of the target genes to occur.  %%%
               The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is much more complicated
              than was first believed. It is now known that epigenetic effects such as gene
              methylation can be the determining factor in gene expression. A gene which
              controls the methylation of target genes in the mouse will be isolated by
              positional cloning and analyzed. It is the first such locus to be characterized
              in mammals and detailed understanding of its mode of action should greatly
              expand our knowledge of mechanisms of gene silencing in higher organisms.  ***
