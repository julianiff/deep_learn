Abstract    :
               9506393  Stebbins  This research will involve continuation of a research
              program on the structure and dynamics of silicate melts, glasses and crystals. 
              The primary experimental approach will be nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy and relaxation measurements, but a variety of new NMR methods will
              also be used.  An unusual aspect of this research will continue to be NMR
              spectroscopy at temperatures as high as 1400 to possibly 1600oC.  The general
              objective of this research plan is to provide quantitative data on the
              atomic-scale nature of disorder in silicate minerals and the dynamics of how
              this disorder is produced, in order to better constrain models of  macroscopic
              properties such as free energy, entropy, viscosity, and diffusivity,
              emphasizing those which are most important for eeological processes.
