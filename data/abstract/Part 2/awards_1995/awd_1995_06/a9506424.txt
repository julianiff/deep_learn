Abstract    :
              9506424  Ru     The proposed research lies in the interface of number theory and
              several complex variables. It seeks to understand the somewhat mysterious
              relationship between Nevanlinna theory and diophantine geometry. In particular,
              the investigator proposes to give a single proof for the second main theorem in
              Nevanlinna theory and the Roth-Schmidt-Faltings theorem in diophantine
              geometry.    Recently, formal analogies between certain areas of complex
              geometry and number theory have been observed. This is exciting in that on the
              face of it these are two totally unrelated areas of mathematics: number theory
              deals with integer equations whereas complex geometry deals with non-discrete
              objects.
