Abstract    :
              9506305  Greeley      The purpose of this research is to investigate the control
              of a gut hormone called peptide YY (PYY).  Peptide YY is a recently discovered
              gut hormone that is found primarily in cells lining the lumen of the lower
              intestine (colon).  Dr. Greeley's laboratory and others have shown that PYY has
              numerous effects on the upper gut (stomach, pancreas, small intestine).  PYY
              acts as a "brake" on the upper gut.  It can inhibit gastric acid secretion by
              the stomach, digestive enzyme secretion by the pancreas, and it slows movement
              of food down the intestine.  In fact, PYY may be a major regulator or
              coordinator of upper gut function.  In the present research, Dr. Greeley is
              interested in what controls PYY.  He will examine how dietary fat and messages
              from the upper gut affect PYY.  He has evidence to show that ingested fat and
              the stomach hormone, gastrin, can influence PYY.  His research may result in
              new ideas and concepts in how the upper and lower gut communicate with each
              other. There may be universal ways in mammals in which communication occurs
              between the upper and lower gut and he intends to investigate these lines of
              communication.  ***
