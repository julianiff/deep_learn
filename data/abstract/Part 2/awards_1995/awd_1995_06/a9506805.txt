              basis of enzyme specificity. This P.I. outlines experiments designed to define
              the structural components of substrate specificity in the trypsin family of
              serine proteases. This family is chosen because its members display a great
              variety of different substrate specificities, the enzymatic mechanism is well
              characterized and a large amount of structural information is available. In
              previous work, this laboratory constructed trypsin mutants with chymotrypsin
              like specificity. These mutant enzymes have been extensively characterized: the
              kinetics of substrate hydrolysis, inhibition and inactivation have been
              analyzed, and the x ray crystal structures have been solved. This work revealed
              surface loops, which do not contact the substrate or determine specificity in
              the S 1 site. These mutants process substrates at rates comparable to
              chymotrypsin, but are defective in substrate binding. The specificity of the Sl
              site is linked to the Sl' and S2 S4 binding sites, and the structure of the Sl
              site i
