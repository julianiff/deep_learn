Abstract    :
              9506409  Olson      The PI will investigate the dynamics of lithospheric
              deformation in  active tectonic regions on timescales ranging from 1000 to 
              1,000,000 years, using numerical models that include both brittle  faulting and
              ductile flow.  These models will be applied to three  important problems in
              active tectonic regions: rheological control  of the transition from diffuse
              extensional deformation on  continents to concentrated rifting and seafloor
              spreading;  mechanics of transform fault initiation between overlapping 
              spreading centers in oceanic lithosphere; and evolution of the  system of major
              faults and seismicity in Southern California and  the adjacent portion of the
              Basin and Range.  ****
