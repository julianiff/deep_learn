Abstract    :
              Ahrens  9506377   The studies of the Properties of earth materials at high
              pressures and high temperatures are focused on determining the chemical and
              phase composition of the Earth and its internal temperature profile, as well as
              understanding both the planet's evolution and its present internal dynamic
              processes.  These objectives require the application of data such as generated
              by this program, theory, and a wide range of observational data for the Earth.
