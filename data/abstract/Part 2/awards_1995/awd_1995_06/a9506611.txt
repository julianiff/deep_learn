Abstract    :
              9506611  Layne         This grant will continue funding of the UNM/SNL Ion
              Microprobe  Facility, a joint venture of Sandia National; Laboratories and the 
              University of New Mexico's Institute of Meteoritics, begun in July  1992.  The
              facility has historically provided 20 hours/week of  analytical time to NSF
              funded investigations in the earth sciences.   The time allotted to NSF
              supported researchers will now be  increased to 30 hours/week.  More than 19
              separate analytical  packages for trace element and isotopic analysis of
              natural and  experimental materials have been developed at this facility and 
              since the inception of the current NSF facility support grant in  July 1993, an
              aggressive program of preventative maintenance and  instrumental improvements
              has resulted in greater than 93% of  scheduled analytical time running
              successfully.  Future technical  development efforts will place particular
              emphasis on extending the  facilities current strengths and PI's interests in
              the areas of i)  stable isotope ratio analysis, ii) trace element analysis in
              rock  forming silicates, silicate glasses and carbonates, and iii) trace 
              element imaging techniques.  ***
