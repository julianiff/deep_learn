Abstract    :
              SBR-9506485    This dissertation-improvement award supports a study into the
              ways that government scientific-and-technical-information policies affect the
              dissemination of databases containing spatial data, specifically, transfer and
              use of the data generated by national mapping agencies to the research
              community and the commercial information industry.  The study will take the
              form of parallel case studies, with information collected via postal surveys,
              in-person interviews, and archival research.  Spatial-data suppliers and users
              in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and
              the United States will be investigated, to allow for international comparisons.
               The results of the research will be of interest to the government, research,
              and commercial communities of the countries studied, as they grapple with
              substantial international differences in spatial data policy.
