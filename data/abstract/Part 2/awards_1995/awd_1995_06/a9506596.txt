Abstract    :
              9506596  Bilham      The PIs will monitor the vertical motion of four tide gauge
              sites  along the East Coast of the United States and Canada.  They will  also
              make absolute gravity surveys at the four tide gauge sites.   Vertical tectonic
              motions observed with GPS and absolute gravity  when combined with relative sea
              level measurements from the tide  gauge will provide an accurate determination
              of the relative roles  of crustal motion and absolute sea level rise in the
              region.  The  research will examine whether the vertical systematic errors in
              GPS  and absolute gravity are sufficiently low at coastal sites to  permit
              better than 3 mm agreement between the two systems.  Long  term averages given
              suitable corrections for the local effects  suggest that they may agree to 1
              mm.  The proposed research aims to  quantify their true agreement.  ****
