              Lam The objective of this project is to apply the combinatorial synthetic
              peptide library method to identify peptide substrate motifs for various classes
              of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). Approximately 10 million random peptides
              will be screened for each PTK. The two PTKs to be studied include (i) Fes, a
              non receptor linked cytosolic PTKs, and (ii) Src, a non receptor linked,
              membrane anchored PTKs. In an attempt to identify natural substrates, the
              GeneBank will then be searched for proteins that have sequence homology with
              the identified peptides. Detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) studies
              will be performed on synthetic analogues of these peptides. Kinetic parameters
              as well as specificity of these pe ptide substrates will be determined. Based
              on these peptide substrate motifs, pseudosubstrate based peptide inhibitors for
              various PTKs will be developed.  The combinatorial synthetic peptide library
              method based on a "one bead, one  peptide concept" developed by the PI is used
              in this proposal. Random heptapeptide libraries are screened for their ability
              to be phosphorylated by specific PTKs in the presence of  ~32P ATP. After
              incubation, the library is washed and the beads immobilized on a glass plate
              with agarose. The  32P  labeled beads are then identified by autoradiography
              and individual labeled beads isolated for microsequencing. This method has
              already been proven for both the cAMP dependent protein kinase and p60C src
              PTK. Efficient peptide substrates have been identified for these two protein
              kinases. A high throughput solid phase phosphorylation assay system, developed
              in the P.I. s laboratory, is used for the SAR studies. Peptide analogues are
              synthesized on resin beads and used as substrates for the phosphorylation
              reaction. No purification of peptides is required and separation of the free 
              gamma 32P ATP from the solid phase  32P  labeled peptides is easy and rapid as
              peptides are covalently attached to beads. Quantitative autoradiography is then
              used to quantitate the phosphorylation. Using this approach it is possible to
              synthesize and analyze hundreds of analogues within a relatively short time.
              %%% The objective of this research proposal is to apply a novel combinatorial
              peptide library method to identify peptides that can be phosphorylated (the
              transfer of a phosphate group to a peptide or protein) by a number of human
              enzymes named protein tyrosine kinases. These enzymes are especially important
              in regulating various cellular functions such as activation of the immune
              cellular function, differentiation of various cell types, cell growth and
              death, and even the cancerous process. The combinatorial peptide library method
              described in this proposal was first developed in Dr. Lam 's laboratory and
              involves the synthesis of millions of peptide beads. The peptide beads
              phosphorylated by these enzymes will be isolated and their chemical structures
              determined. After several peptide substrates for these enzymes are identified,
              the P.I. plans to synthesize many of their analogs and test their activity.
              Results from such studies will provide important information for the
              understanding of the mechanism of action of these enzymes, and also help us to
              understand the biochemical basis of many important cellular functions. In
              addition, based on these results, he may be able to design specific and potent
              inhibitors for these enzymes. ***                                 @
