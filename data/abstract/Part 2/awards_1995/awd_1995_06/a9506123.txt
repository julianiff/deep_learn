Abstract    :
              This project involves an ethnographic study of how middle class families in
              Turkey strategies to obtain appropriate education's to assure their children's
              access to good jobs as Turkey opens its markets to the West.  The investigators
              are an anthropologist and an economist who will conduct in-depth interviews and
              participant-observation to study the life course and family histories of a
              sample of families from a larger survey done by the investigators recently. 
              The economic context of middle-class work is changing in response to global
              changes in financial markets leading to the liberalization of local economies. 
              The procedures families use to gain access to new jobs and to maintain their
              class status through proper educational and forms of credentials will be
              studied in depth.  This research is important because it will add a case study
              of middle class insecurity and social strategies to the small body of cases
              focused on the US and other Western nations.   Increased understanding of the
              Turkish case will advance our understanding of general processes as against
              culturally particular reactions.  General knowledge of middle-class situations
              and strategies is valuable because many anti-government political movements
              have been fueled by middle-class resentment and frustration at being blocked
              from the high standard of living and social position promised by governments
              instituting radical socio-economic changes.  This sort of in-depth ethnographic
              study will provide valuable information on local middle-class reactions to
              global changes.
