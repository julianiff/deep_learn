Abstract    :
              9506693  Tucker    This grant provides $120,000 for three years of partial 
              technician support for the University's Geochronology lab in the  Department of
              Earth & Planetary Sciences.  The university has  provided one year (Jan 94 -
              Jan 95) of support for a Ph.D.-level  technical scientist (Dr. Yuri Amelin) and
              will provide ca. 40% of  the next three years of salary support.  The
              technician will have  responsibility for quality control, maintenance
              procedures,  supervision of graduate students and visiting scientists and 
              improving procedures at this lab which was established with the  acquisition of
              a state-of-the-art VG sector 54 Thermal Ionization  Mass Spectrometer purchased
              in January, 1994 (EAR-9219862).  Although, the instrument has only recently
              attained its  manufacturer's specifications in terms of precision due to the 
              need for replacement of the original photomultiplier tube, the PI  has
              carefully documented a large number of analyses of standards,  blanks and
              initial samples of accessory minerals for U-Pb isotope  series dating.  The
              high-sensitivity, high-transmission  instrument has afforded this lab the
              ability to make ultra-high  precision measurements of Pb isotope ratios which,
              coupled with  their class-100 clean room and careful chemical preparation of 
              samples has resulted in very low, total-procedure, common-Pb  blanks that
              ultimately translates into precise ( 3 Ma) dating  capabilities for small (as
              little as 2 g) samples of accessory  phase minerals.      ***
