Abstract    :
              9506725  Cannon       This project asks, "Does variable negative curvature imply
               constant negative curvature in dimension three?"  More precisely,  the project
              seeks a proof that a negatively curved (Gromov  hyperbolic) group with 2-sphere
              at infinity acts coaompactly,  isometrically, and properly discontinuously on
              hyperbolic 3-space.   This goal would constitute a major step forward in
              establishing  Thurston's important geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds
              and  would also have important consequences in the study of Kleinian  groups,
              negatively curved groups, conformal mapping, and Riemannian  geometry.  Prior
              work of the principal investigator and coworkers  has reduced the problem to
              the study of discrete conformal mapping  problems about finite subdivision
              rules in the plane.  Secondary,  but related, problems concern algorithmic
              techniques with  negatively curved or almost convex groups.       All of
              geometry and its applications takes place within  mathematical models or
              "spaces."  Topology seeks to classify these  models and to understand their
              chief local and global properties.  The most important of these models are the
              "manifolds," the locally  Euclidean spaces.  Mathematicians have to great
              effect long since  classified the 2-dimensional manifolds and have a
              corresponding  valuable, yet conjectural, picture of 3-dimensional manifolds, 
              called "Thurston's geometrization conjecture."  The project seeks  a proof of
              one piece of that conjecture, namely that 3-manifolds  that in the large behave
              like negatively curved spaces can in fact  be smoothed so as to have constant
              negative curvature in the small.  An affirmative answer would reduce many
              problems about 3-manifolds  to well-developed techniques involving matrix
              theory, algebra, and  analysis, with corresponding economies in mathematical
              physics and  elsewhere that these models are used.  ***
