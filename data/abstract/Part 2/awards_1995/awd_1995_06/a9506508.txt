Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Ruben  
              Reininger of The University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center   will
              probe fundamental aspects of photoionization in dense media.  The   main
              experimental tool will be field ionization of states excited by   means of
              vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation.  The two basic   quantities inherent
              to photoionization in dense media, the polarization   energy of the positive
              ion and the energy of the quasi-free electron,   will be determined.  Systems
              to be studied include methyl iodide in   liquid argon and liquid xenon, NO in
              liquid argon, and pure ethane.    These studies are expected to yield
              experimental data with which recent   theoretical models describing the
              evolution of energy levels as a   function of the density of the medium may be
              tested and revised.  A considerable amount of theoretical work has recently
              been reported on   the electronic structure of liquids and the dependence of
              this structure   on density in order to understand how this structure changes
              from   individual atoms to the solids they form.  Dr. Reininger will probe this
                structure by using field induced photoionization, which will provide  
              information concerning the polarization energy of the ion in the fluid   and
              the energy of the electron ejected by ionization.  This information   will then
              be used to test current theories and indicate how these   theories must be
              modified.
