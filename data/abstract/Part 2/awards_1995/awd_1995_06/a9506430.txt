Abstract    :
              This proposal will partially support 17 scientists attending the  24th
              International Cosmic Ray Conference in Rome, Italy.  The  conference will cover
              topics ranging from particle astrophysics and  elementary particles to high
              energy astrophysics to geomagnetic and  solar phenomena.  The American Physical
              Society's Division of  Astrophysics will set up a committee to select
              individuals for  these travel funds based on a competitive basis of research 
              quality, financial need, and geographical and institutional  distribution.***
