Abstract    :
              9506463  Bado   The objective of this research is to develop a high-sensitivity
              analytical instrument for determining the chemical composition of various
              organic, inorganic, and biological samples.  The instrument will employ the
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging technique
              with femtosecond laser post-ionization to map with spatial resolution better
              than 100 nanometers in two- and three-dimensions.  TOF-SIMS is a variant of
              surface mass spectroscopy and has been proven through prior research to have
              the capability for imaging at  the predicted sensitivity.  In this research
              phase, the sensitivity of the analyzer and its imaging capabilities will be
              increased, and its design and operation will be simplified.   An instrument
              such as this has many potential commercial applications.  It would be useful in
              fields including surface phenomena analysis, environmental sciences, clinical
              analysis, catalysis, semiconductor testing, and drug screening.
