Abstract    :
              19506541  Merrill      The PI will investigate whether the probability of
              reversals in the  magnetic field of the Earth is related to the intensity of
              the  field, determine if there are robust differences between the 
              time-averaged normal and reversed polarity states of the magnetic  field, and
              use paleomagnetic data to determine the character of  secular variation in the
              magnetic field.    ****
