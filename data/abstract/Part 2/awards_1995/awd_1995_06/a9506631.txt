Abstract    :
              9506631  Candela  The P.I.s will obtain experimental data and construct models
              that bear on problems of geothermal energy systems, volcanic hazards, volcanic
              inputs to the atmosphere, and exploration for mineral deposits.  In the first,
              and most extensive part of this research endeavor, experiments will be
              performed on the partitioning of many elements, between melt, brine, vapor, and
              crystals, covering a range of melt compositions, temperatures, oxygen
              fugacities and pressures at and below 1 kilobar.  In the second part, the P.I.s
              will completely redo their magmatic devolatilization model to account for the
              effects of a percolation model on the chemistry of devolatilized vapor+brine,
              and account for the new equilibria that have been collected by our lab and by
              other workers.  The third part of the proposed research will study the
              observable effects of volatile exsolution on hydrous minerals, and on textures
              of the associated granitic rocks.  Detailed mineralogy, geochemistry and
              petrography (micro- and marcroscopic) will be conbined with, and interpreted in
              light of , the results of modeling and experimental efforts outlined above.
