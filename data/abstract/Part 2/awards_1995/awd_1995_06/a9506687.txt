Abstract    :
              The lower Colorado River extensional corridor in southern Nevada, western
              Arizona and  southeastern California is an ideal natural laboratory  in which
              to examine the interplay between  continental extension and magmatism. Most of
              the >100% extension was concentrated over a rather short  time interval (1-4
              m.y.) after which both faulting and volcanism decreased rapidly. This study
              will  focus on the structural/tectonic and petrological evolution of the
              northern Eldorado Mountains in  Nevada, where a good data base of geological
              mapping, high precision 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and  structural analysis
              already exists. Changes in major element geochemistry in the volcanic rocks 
              erupted before, during and after large-scale extension will show how the
              magmatic rocks responded to  rheological changes in the lower crust and mantle
              during extension. The results of this study will  provide direct documentation
              of the relationship between rates of extension and changes in the  composition
              of mafic magmas in highly extended continental terranes, and will have
              wide-reaching  application to other extensional  tectonic environments.
