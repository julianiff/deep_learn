Abstract    :
              This research project in communication protocols focuses on the study of formal
              modeling of communication protocols which spans the areas of protocol
              specification, verification, testing and performance.  Goals of the project are
              to provide a unification of the formulation techniques across all of these
              areas from specification to testing and to add the capability of studying
              performance within the same kind of formulation. Currently the approaches used
              to formally specify a protocol are different from those used to verify the
              logical correctness of a protocol.  There is also a gap between the
              verification formulations and the conformance test generation formulations. 
              The research studies in this project are aimed at closing these two gaps and
              thereby providing a more integrated approach to the design of communication
              protocols from specification to verification to testing.  In addition, the
              studies aim to allow one to investigate the performance of the protocol at an
              early stage of the design, again using the same formulation techniques as in
              specification and verification.
