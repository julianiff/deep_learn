Abstract    :
                  9506828  Gavis    Establishment of anterior-posterior polarity of the
              Drosophila  embryo requires the asymmetric distribution of determinant 
              molecules. Restriction of the posterior determinant, encoded by the  nanos
              gene, to the posterior of the embryo is essential for normal  development. High
              concentrations of Nanos in the anterior of the  embryo suppresses head and
              thorax development. Spatial restriction  of nanos expression occurs by a novel
              mechanism; translational  repression of unlocalized nanos RNA and derepression
              by  localization of nanos RNA to the posterior pole. Independent but 
              overlapping cis-acting sequence elements have been identified  within the nanos
              3' untranslated region (3' UTR) that mediate RNA  localization and
              translational repression of unlocalized nanos RNA.  The proposed research aims
              to elucidate the molecular mechanism  that effects translational regulation of
              nanos RNA and its linkage  to RNA localization by identification and
              characterization of  components of the cellular machinery that act through the
              defined  nanos 3'UTR sequences. The experiments described will be directed 
              toward: 1) further analysis of the cis-acting sequences that  mediate
              localization dependent translational control guided by  evolutionary sequence
              and secondary structure comparisons and  identification of binding sites for
              trans acting factors and 2)  isolation and characterization of factors that
              interact with the  translational control element by both biochemical methods
              and  genetic screens.  ***
