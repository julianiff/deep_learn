Abstract    :
              9506469  Bird  The research program will investigate hydrothermal chronology of
              the 55 Ma to 35 Ma epizonal plutonic complexes at Kap Gustav Holm, Imilik,
              Kialineq, and Nualik in central East Greenland.  The objective is to determine
              temporal variations in the stable isotope composition of Eocene meteoritic
              water caused by climatic and geographic changes related to initiation of the
              Iceland mantle plume and crustal rifting between Greenland and Eurasia.   With
              support from the Danish Lithosphere Center samples for this study were
              collected from the Kap Gustav Holm complex in the summer of 1994 and samples
              from the remaining plutonic centers will be collected during the summer of
              1995.  The research is based on determinations of radiometric (40Ar/39Ar) ages
              and oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of amphiboles and K-micas from the
              plutonic centers.  Laboratory studies will initially focus on phase relations,
              compositions, and parageneses of hydrothermal minerals and will be completed in
              approximately 1.5 years.  The remainder of the project will involve synthesis
              and analysis of the data, and evaluation of our findings in terms of climate
              changes that accompanied the paleogeographic evolution of the North Atlantic
              Ocean basins and gateways.
