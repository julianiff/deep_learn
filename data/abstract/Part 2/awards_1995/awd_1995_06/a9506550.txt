Abstract    :
              MacFadden  9506550   This proposal seeks NSF grant support for a three-year
              project to investigate the ancient feeding ecology and evolution of Cenozoic
              mammalian herbivore communities of southern South America using the classic
              60-myr sequence from Argentina.  The research will address three interrelated
              themes of fossil mammal paleoecology: (1) the long-standing enigma of why
              extinct notoungulates acquired high-crowned teeth, and presumably grazing
              diets, earlier in South America than most northern hemisphere high-crowned
              herbivorous mammals; (2) endemic/immigrant mammal feeding ecology with the goal
              of a better understanding of biotic interactions during the Plio-Pleistocene
              Great American Interchange; and (3) the evolution of C3 an C4 photosynthesis
              and timing of grassland spread in southern South America.  This study will be
              accomplished by (1) determining the stable carbon isotope               (  13C)
              values of tooth enamel and (2) analyzing molar tooth morphology (i.e., relative
              unworn crown height).  The data from carbon isotopes combined with tooth-crown
              height will determine whether a particular extinct herbivore taxon was a C3
              browser, C3 grazer, mixed feeder, or C4 grazer.  (During the middle and late
              Cenozoic, pure C3 feeders have mean tooth enamel apatite  13 values of ca. -13
              parts per mil, whereas pre C4-feeders have mean tooth enamel apatite values of
              ca. 0%.  In general, low-crowned herbivorous mammals are predominately
              browsers, whereas high-crowned herbivorous mammals are predominately grazers. 
              These two methods, which until recently have not been used together, are a
              powerful new tool in fossil mammal paleontology to understand long-term
              ecosystem evolution and global change through geologic time.   Funds are
              requested for (1) museum travel to obtain additional specimens for isotopic
              analysis and to construct a data base on mammalian herbivore hypsodonty at La
              Plata (1 trip), the American Museum of Natural History (1 trip), and the Field
              Museum of Natural History (1 trip);  of Utah; (3) one trip for my Argentine
              colleague (Prado) to visit the Florida Museum of Natural History; and (4) one
              graduate student assistantship.
