Abstract    :
              SBR-9506434  Thomas J. Bassett  Leslie Gray  University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign    The Social and Physical Dynamics of Environmental Change in
              Western Burkina Faso      A multi-scale investigation of the social and
              physical dimensions of land degradation in western Burkina Faso is the goal of
              this research project.  The perceptions and decisions of villagers that
              constitute the crucial links in the causal chain connecting social processes to
              land degradation will be evaluated.  The effects of changing cropping practices
              on soil quality and social organization will be analyzed for one village. 
              Hypotheses generated from the single village analysis will be tested using
              surveys from several villages.  Mapping how various processes like new
              agricultural technologies;  transformations in land, labor, and wealth; and
              shifts in government agricultural and conservation policy, have interacted and
              influenced the actions, perceptions, and decisions of small-scale farmers, is
              crucial in understanding and explaining place-specific degradation.  Such
              understanding will improve society's ability to minimize such land degradation.
