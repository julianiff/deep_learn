Abstract    :
                  9506262  Straus    The goal of Dr. Straus' work is to understand how
              totipotency, the  ability to undergo embryogenesis, is restricted to a specific
               subset of embryonic cells in Volvox carteri. Volvox is ideal for  dissecting
              the mechanisms underlying the regulation of totipotency  because it is composed
              of only two cell types: germ line and  somatic. Furthermore, the entire pathway
              that determines cell fate  is accessible to genetic and biochemical analysis.
              Volvox  individuals have about 16 germ line cells that are specialized to 
              undergo embryogenesis and about 2,000 somatic cells that provide  motility and
              never divide. During embryogenesis, a single large  germ line cell undergoes
              rapid cleavage divisions to form a 2,000  celled embryo. The embryonic
              blastomeres then differentiate in a  reproducible lineage dependent manner into
              somatic cells and germ  line cells. The specialized somatic and germ line
              phenotypes are  ultimately due to the differential expression of cell type
              specific  gene sets. Dr. Straus' laboratory is cloning a gene, regA, that is 
              needed for correct cell type specific gene expression and cell fate 
              determination. In regA minus mutants somatic cells ectopically  express the
              gene set that normally is confined to the germ line in  addition to expressing
              the normal somatic cell repertoire. The  somatic cells of these mutants
              redifferentiate into totipotent germ  line cells. During the previous funding
              period Dr. Straus localized  the regA gene to a small chromosomal region using
              Targeted RFLP  Subtraction, a powerful and general method he developed for 
              isolating genes defined by mutations. He proposes to complete the  physical
              characterization of the regA locus and to isolate the gene  from the region.
              Cloning the gene will allow him to investigate the  role of regA in limiting
              totipotency and to learn how the processes  of cell fate determination and cell
              differentiation are integrated  in Volvox.  ***
