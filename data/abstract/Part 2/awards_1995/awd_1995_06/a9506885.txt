Abstract    :
              9506885  Belote   A genetic and molecular analysis of proteasomes in Drosophila
              will be done. The gene, l(2)73Ai, encodes a component of the proteasome. It was
              originally defined by the existence of an unusual dominant
              temperature-sensitive lethal mutant, l(3)73Ail. The developmental consequences
              of  loss-of-function mutant alleles of this gene will be studied. Detailed
              analysis of the phenotype of these mutants will be done, including examination
              of possible maternal effects on early embryogensis. A second gene, DTS7, which
              evidence suggests plays an important role in proteasome function or regulation
              will be cloned and characterized. Extragenic suppressors of 1(3)73Ai1 will be
              identified and characterized. One such suppressor of  1(3)73Ai1 has already
              been identified and experiments will be done to define its genetic and
              phenotypic properties.   %%%  Regulated protein degradation is important for
              normal cell function, playing a key role in such diverse processes as growth
              control, metabolic regulation, embryonic development and cell cycle
              progression. Targeted protein breakdown is also important for protecting cells
              against a variety of abnormal conditions. Thus, an understanding of how cells
              selectively identify unwanted proteins and target them for destruction has
              fundamental importance for an understanding of many areas of biology. Recent
              studies have shown that an essential component of intracellular proteolysis is
              the proteasome, a large, multi-subunit complex that acts as the proteolytic
              core of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degrading machinery, responsible for
              the removal of abnormal polypeptides and short-lived regulatory proteins from
              eukaryotic cells. This work, a genetic characterization of one of the
              components of the proteasome of Drosophila, will increase our understanding of
              the genetic control of this very important biological process.  ***
