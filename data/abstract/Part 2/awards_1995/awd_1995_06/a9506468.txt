Abstract    :
              9506468  Liou  This research involves a study of rocks from the Dabie-Sulu
              ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane of eastcentral China.  Topics to be studied
              include:  (1) the areal extent of the extreme geochemical anomalies in negative
              delta 18-oxygen values and high epsilon Nd bulk-rock values, (2) the breadth of
              UHP metamorphism in the Dabie-Sulu collision zone, (3) the source and
              composition of volatiles during UHP metamorphism, and (4) the petrochemical
              differences between the UHP garnet-bearing ultramafics derived from cumulate
              intrusive and those from mantle wedges.  These UHP metamorphic rocks are under
              intense investigation because they have been subjected to P-T conditions
              involting low temperatures and high pressures up to 45 kbars, in a tectonic
              setting responsible for arc-magma genesis and for intermediate-depth
              earthquakes.
