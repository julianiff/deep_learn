Abstract    :
              9506881  Haselkorn    The objective of this U.S.-Czech joint research project
              between  Dr. Robert Haselkorn of the University of Chicago and Dr. Vaclav 
              Paces of the Czech Institute of Molecular Genetics is to clone  and sequence
              particular fragments of the chromosome from three  strains of the bacterium
              Rhodobacter capsulatus.  This bacterium  is purple and non-photosynthetic and
              useful in studies of  carotenoid biosynthesis, photochemical reactions centers,
              and  nitrogen fixation.  The fragments to be characterized and cloned  by the
              researchers contain the junctions created by large-scale  chromosomal
              rearrangements and changes.  The collaborative effort  should yield new
              knowledge about the bacterium's nucleotide  sequences and may help determine
              the mechanisms of these  rearrangements. Results would further our basic
              understanding of  genome plasticity and evolution.    This project in microbial
              genetics fulfills the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in  the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual 
              interest and competence.   ***
