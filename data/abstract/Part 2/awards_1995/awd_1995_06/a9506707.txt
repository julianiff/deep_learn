Abstract    :
              9506707    Duraiswami      The research is directed at developing a PC-based,
              user-friendly, on-board multitasking ship maneuvering simulator incorporating
              operation in confined water and under the action of wind and waves.  The
              objectives are to extend the multi-objective identification method to on-board
              identification using on-board measurements; reduce structural uncertainty in
              the model through invoking alternative mathematical models for the same ship
              and create a database of models for various types of ships and different
              environment conditions.  This would lead to the development of multitasking
              software for simulating several ships simultaneously and its implementation
              with a user-friendly and realistic graphical interfaces.      A library of
              mathematical models for different ship configurations, and environmental
              conditions of wind, sea state, proximity of channel-sides and walls will be
              created based on existing fundamental models for ship hydrodynamics.  A new
              multiobjective identification approach that uses a set of mathematical models
              for parameter identification of the same system will also be developed to
              reduce structural uncertainty of the model.  These developments will allow
              simulation of different types of ships navigating in critically important
              situations.
