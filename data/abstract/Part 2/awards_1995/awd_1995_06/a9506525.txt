Abstract    :
              The intrusion of magma into rocks representing various tectonic settings is a
              common  phenomena, however how the crust accommodates the volume  of magma and
              the mechanisms involved in emplacement of plutons are controversial.  This
              project will examine four plutons that represent  different depths of intrusion
              to determine the interactions between the internal structure of the  plutons
              and their wall rocks under varying conditions.  The work will involve study of
              magmatic  fabrics using AMS analysis to determine the AMS signatures, the
              magmatic and solid-state  microstructures and will be combined with other data
              to correlate the internal magmatic structures of  the plutons to the solid
              state processes acting an their margins.  Results will provide the bases for 
              analysis of their emplacement mechanisms (which are controlled by a combination
              of pre-existing host  rock structures, syn-intrusive regional stresses and
              magmatic pressures).
