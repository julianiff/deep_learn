Abstract    :
              9506674    Harms   This project will map at 1: 25,000-scale part of the Dorsey
              terrane and adjacent rocks in northern British Columbia/Yukon territory,
              Canada. The structural and stratigraphic data will provide the basis for
              comparison and correlation of the Dorsey terrane with the distal continental
              margin of North America, displaced distal continental margin fragments, or
              truly exotic terranes that contain similar lithologies. The results of this
              project will provide a greatly improved model for the paleogeographic setting
              of the western edge of North America during the Paleozoic. In addition, the
              data will be integrated with the Canadian Lithopropbe project to study the deep
              crust in northern British Columbia, and will thus help constrain tectonic
              models for this region of North America. Undergraduate students will be
              involved in this research project at every stage.
