Abstract    :
              9506767  BOYD                             This research is to digitally scan
              seismic phase observations  tabulated in the International Seismological
              Summary (ISS) and  Bureau Central International Seismologique (BCIS) catalogs,
              use  these observations to compute high quality hypocenters based on 
              techniques developed within the last few years, make tectonic  interpretations
              based on these relocated earthquakes, and make the  digitized phase
              observations and the recomputed hypocenters  available to interested research
              groups.  The result will be a much  more complete and accurate seismicity
              catalog, especially prior to  1964 when the WWSSN program was implemented, that
              can be used to  understand deformation and seismic hazard within the U.S. and 
              throughout the world.  This research is a component of the National  Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
