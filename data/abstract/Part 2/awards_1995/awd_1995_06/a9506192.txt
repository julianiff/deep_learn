Abstract    :
                  9506192  Marks    Very little is known about the mechanisms that control
              cell fate in  plants. The development of hairs (called trichomes) on the leaves
               of Arabidopsis thaliana plants is being used as a model to study  cell fate in
              plants. Two genes that are required for the commitment  of leaf epidermal cells
              to enter the trichome developmental pathway  are TTG and GL1. Mutations in
              these genes results in a loss of  trichome initiation. Both of these genes are
              thought to function as  transcription factors that regulate other genes
              required for  trichome morphogenesis. This proposal will further the study of
              the  role of GL1 in trichome development and also extend the  characterization
              to the TTG gene. The proposed experiments will  provide information on how GL1
              and TTG are regulated and will  identify genes that are regulated by GL1 and
              TTG. The expected  significance of this work is tow fold. first, it provides a 
              convenient system to study cell fate in plants. Second, trichome  developments
              provides a practical model. Trichomes on many plant  species serve as a barrier
              between the plant and a hostile  environment. many crop plants such as Canola
              lack protective  trichomes. The ability to manipulate  the morphology, density
              and  placement of trichomes on Arabidopsis plants is rapidly evolving.  It is
              hoped that the information learned about Arabidopsis can be  applied to
              Brassica species and other crop plants.  ***
