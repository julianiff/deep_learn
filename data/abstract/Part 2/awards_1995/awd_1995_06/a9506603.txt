Abstract    :
              9506603  Van Vleck       The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences 
              and the Center for Wave Phenomena at the Colorado School of  Mines (CSM)
              propose to purchase one Silicon Graphics Power  Challenge L and five Silicon
              Graphics Indigo2 workstations.  These machines will comprise the core research
              computing  environment for both the Department and the Center. This 
              environment will facilitate the generation of distributed  code for ongoing
              research projects at CSM.  The system will  provide a distributed computing
              environment that will be  employed for several projects. In particular, it will
               immediately enhance projects in (1) Computational Biological  and Material
              Sciences, (2) Parallel Numerical Methods, (3)  Symbolic Computation, (4) Neural
              Networks, and (5) Seismic  Modeling and Inversion.
