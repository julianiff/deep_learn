Abstract    :
              9506781  Staub      One of the intriguing questions in evolutionary biology is
              how do new traits arise.  In several species of the salamander genus Aneides,
              females express features that typically are expressed only in males.  Dr.
              Staub's research goal is to examine the hormonal basis for the normal
              expression of these traits in females.  She will use both a comparative and
              experimental approach to investigate the relationship between hormonal and
              morphological variation. In the proposed project, differences between species
              and between males and females in jaw muscle sensitivity to male sex hormones
              (androgens) will be examined.  In addition, hormone levels will be analyzed to
              determine seasonal patterns of androgens and estrogens.  Results will be
              analyzed in an evolutionary framework with the goal of understanding how
              hormonal variation can explain the profound shape variation expressed within
              this salamander group.  The significance of the proposed project is that it
              will provide information on the role of androgens in the development of female
              traits, a role that has remained relatively unexplored.  ***
