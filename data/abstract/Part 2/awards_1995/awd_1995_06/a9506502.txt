Abstract    :
              9506502  FISCHER    This research is to use S-wave splitting to constrain
              subduction  zone anisotropy.  Initial results indicate that in subduction zones
               with an oceanic upper plate and active back-arc spreading (Tonga,  Izu-bonin
              and the Marianas), shear-wave splitting manifests a fast  direction roughly
              parallel to the azimuth of convergence.  In  regions where the upper plate is
              quasi-continental (north-central  Japan, the Kamchatka peninsula, and the
              eastern Aleutians) fast  directions are roughly perpendicular to the direction
              of  convergence.  The focus of this work will be to better resolve the 
              location, orientation and strength of subduction zone anisotropy.   An existing
              three-dimensional finite-difference method will be  modified for the
              calculation of synthetic seismograms in  anisotropic media.  This method will
              aid in distinguishing waveform  perturbations due to anisotropy from those
              caused by other  subduction zone structure.  ***
