Abstract    :
              Model selection, parameter estimation, and spectral analysis are  three
              important areas in statistical signal processing.  This  research explores some
              difficult and unresolved problems in these  disciplines by exploiting Bayesian
              theory.  Topics of interest  include the derivation of model selection rules
              based on asymptotic  assumptions and their applications to problems in array
              processing,  rank determination in time series analysis, and segmentation of 
              vector fields; analysis of transient signals and parameter  estimation of
              highly nonlinear models such as threshold signal  models and bilinear models;
              and, Bayesian spectral analysis of  nonstationary signals.    This effort
              primarily consists of three equally important  components.  The first is a
              theoretical investigation into these  problems that leads to an improved
              understanding of various signal  models and concepts.  The second is the
              practical application of  the solutions, which includes automatic segmentation
              of medical  images and the processing of single channel patch clamp currents.  
              The third is  purely educational.  Students are given a practical  exposition
              into the versatility of Bayesian inference and its  applicability for solving a
              wide range of signal processing  problems.
