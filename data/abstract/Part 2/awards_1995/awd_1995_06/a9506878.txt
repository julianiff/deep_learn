Abstract    :
              9506878  Reeves  The HMG-I(Y) family of "high mobility group" (HMG) nonhistone
              proteins are of considerable current interest because they are founding members
              of a newly described category of nuclear proteins called "architectural
              transcription factors" that appear to be involved in the in vivo regulation of
              both the chromatin structure and the transcriptional activity of an increasing
              large group of mammalian genes.  However, the HMG-I(Y) proteins are
              distinguished from other HMG proteins in this category of factors by their
              ability to specifically bind, both in vitro and in vivo, to A(T-rich B-form DNA
              by the recognition of structure rather than nucleotide sequence.  Available
              evidence suggests two principal, though not mutually exclusive, models of how
              the HMG-I(Y) proteins might function in chromatin as gene transcription
              regulatory proteins.  The first postulates a nucleosome positioning or
              "phasing" role for HMG-I(Y) whereby binding of the protein to DNA substrates of
              a particular structure(s) establishes a "boundary" that influences placement of
              adjacent nucleosomes in important areas such as certain gene distortions in
              substrate DNA, HMG-I(Y) facilitates the binding of transcription factors to
              promoter/enhancer sequences and also functions to bring together separated
              regulatory regions so that they can form a stereo-specific multiprotein complex
              necessary for transcription initiation.  This research will experimentally test
              specific aspect of one of these models.  We will employ care selected in vitro
              systems to quantitatively evaluate the role of HMG-I(Y) in both DNA-bending and
              in nucleosome positioning/phasing in reconstituted chromatin and will assess
              the effects of HMG-I(Y) on the in vitro transcriptional competence of precisely
              defined chromatin templates.  %%%  The HMG-I(Y) family of "high mobility group"
              (HMG) nonhistone proteins are of considerable current interest because they are
              founding members of a newly described category of nuclear proteins called
              "architectural transcrip tion factors" that appear to be involved in the in
              vivo regulation of both the chromatin structure and the transcriptional
              activity of an increasing large group of mammalian genes.  However, the
              HMG-I(Y) proteins are distinguished from other HMG proteins in this category of
              factors by their ability to specifically bind, both in vitro and in vivo, to
              A(T-rich B-form DNA by the recognition of structure rather than nucleotide
              sequence.  This research will address, in a precise and quantitative manner,
              the important question of how the HMG-I(Y) proteins might influence the
              structure and function of eukaryotic chromatin in vivo.  The results obtained
              from these in vitro studies will set the parameters for, and define the limits
              of, future experiments aimed at elucidating the in vivo function of these
              unusual and intriguing regulatory proteins.  ***
