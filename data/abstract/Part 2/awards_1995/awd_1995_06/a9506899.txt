Abstract    :
                  9506899  Ho    This proposal seeks to understand the development of
              posterior body  formation in the relatively simple vertebrate system of
              zebrafish.  By using cell marking and time lapse techniques, a fate map for 
              tail bud development will be elucidated to test the hypothesis that  cells
              within the tail bud contribute to the formation of the  posterior body in an
              organized, stereotypic manner. The cell  movements and final cell fates
              stemming from the tail bud region  will be correlated with specific patterns of
              gene expression in the  tail bud. This proposal also will determine if an
              organizer region  exists for the proper development of the posterior body and
              will  determine if this organizer region is related to the organizer  region of
              the trunk and head regions.  ***
