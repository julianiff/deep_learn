Abstract    :
              9506716  Rea       A high-resolution stratigraphic study will be undertaken to 
              ascertain the timing of the onset of global conditions on Siberia  and Alaska
              and the timing of the massive late Pliocene volcanism  on the North Pacific rim
              on orbital and millennial timescales,  based on IRD fluxes and tephrochronology
              of cores from North  Pacific, respectively.  The temporal relationship between
              the two  phenomena will determine if the massive volcanic activity was 
              responsible for the onset of large scale glaciation in the  Northern Hemisphere
              at the end of Pliocene.  ***
