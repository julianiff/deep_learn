Abstract    :
              9506045  Johnston  This project involves a three-year experimental research
              program on the near-solidus melting behavior of a range of peridotites, varying
              both the compositional fertility of their constituent minerals and the modal
              abundances of these minerals.  A specific focus will be determining the
              stoichiometry of the solidus reaction for different peridotites and the manner
              in which the stoichiometry of the melting reaction changes at super-solidus
              temperatures.  The study will involve various combinations of pure mineral
              separates from natural peridotite xenoliths, with several mixtures
              intentionally enriched in spinel and/or clinopyroxene to enhance the signal
              imparted by these phases on the melting process.  the near-solidus melting
              behavior of these mixtures will then be investigated using the diamond
              aggregate experimental technique.
