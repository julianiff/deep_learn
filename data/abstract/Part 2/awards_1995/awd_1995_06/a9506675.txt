Abstract    :
              9506675  Anderson  The Guerrero Accelerograph Array consists of 30 strong motion
               accelerograph stations in Guerrero and neighboring states of  Mexico. It was
              installed under NSF Grant CEE 82-19432, and has  continued to be fully
              operational with subsequent grants from the  National Science Foundation
              supplemented by support obtained by  and from the Instituto de Ingenieria,
              Universidad Nacional  Autonoma de Mexico. Because of Mexico's high seismicity,
              the  array is currently producing accelerograms from 50 to 80  earthquakes per
              year. The data set includes over 20 significant  earthquakes with 10 or more
              records each. It has already recorded  4 earthquakes with magnitudes 6.9 or
              greater at close range. Most  important, it is located in a mature seismic gap,
              where an  earthquake with magnitude up to 8.2 is considered more likely  than
              at any other place in North America.    This action is to continue support for
              the array operations, and  for cataloging  and distributing the data recorded. 
              Accelerograms recorded to date are available on the Internet  World Wide Web.
