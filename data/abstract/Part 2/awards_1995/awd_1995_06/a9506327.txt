Abstract    :
              9506327  Pilz    The transcription factor NF-E2 (a complex of two proteins,  p45
              and p18) binds to specific DNA sequences in the  regulatory regions of
              erythroid genes and appears to be  necessary for the transcriptional activation
              of these genes  during red blood cell maturation.  The PI has recently found 
              that murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL), a model system of  red blood cells,
              that are deficient in cAMP dependent  protein kinase (A kinase), an enzyme
              involved in signal  transduction, are severely impaired in their ability to 
              mature and activate erythroid genes.   The also have  abnormal binding of 
              NF-E2.  Preliminary experiments  suggested that A-kinase regulates NF-E2  by
              phosphorylating  p45 and by regulating the complex formation of p45 and p18. 
              The experiments in this grant will test examine this  further.   The
              phosphorylation of  p45 by A kinase will be  studied by determining which amino
              acids are phosphorylated,  to see if this phosphorylation occurs during red
              blood cell  maturation, and determibne if this phosphorylation of p45  changes
              its its complex formation with p18 and alters the  ability of  NF-E2 to
              activate erythroid genes.     The next  series of experiments will examine
              proteins which interact  with NF-E2 and see if these interactions alter  its 
              function.  %%%  The results of this research will increase our knowledge of 
              the regulation of NF-E2 function and define the role of A-  kinase during red
              blood cell maturation.  They will also  provide information on the general
              functions of this enzyme  in signal transduction.  ***
