Abstract    :
              9506178  Boxer  This research grant funds continued support for biophysical
              studies  of the mechanism of charge separation and recombination processes  in
              reaction centers (RCs) from photosynthetic bacteria. The  specific approaches
              to these problems include: (i) the nature of  the excited state of the special
              pair primary electron donor, 1P,  which initiates charge separation probed by
              resonance Raman and  higher order Stark spectroscopies; (ii) distinguishing one
              step and  two step electron transfer by measurements on RCs in which 
              components are modified or removed by genetic engineering; (iii)  electric
              field modulation of the spontaneous fluorescence from 1P  to determine whether
              the field affects the primary charge  separation step and the direction of the
              electric dipole moment  whose formation competes with 1P decay; (iv) studies of
              the  interaction between the bacteriochlorophyll molecules comprising P  and
              the protein environment by converting residues which make  functionally
              specific interactions with P into glycine, creating  cavities which can bind
              exogenous organic molecules to modulate  photosynthetic function; and (v) the
              origin of unidirectional  electron transfer probed by site specific mutagenesis
              based both on  measurements of dielectric asymmetry and an evolutionary
              analysis.  %%%  The initial electron transfer events in photosynthetic RCs are
              the  key energy transduction and storage mechanisms essential for all  aspects
              of life on earth. Studies of this system, both at the  detailed molecular level
              and from a more global perspective, can  offer approaches for improving natural
              photosynthesis and modeling  artificial photosynthesis. The photosynthetic
              apparatus is largely  a membrane protein complex whose structure elucidation
              over the  past 10 years has provided, for the first time, information on the 
              folding and organization of membrane proteins. It is likely that  within the
              next 5 years, the overall organization of the  photosynthetic membrane will be
              fully characteriz ed, a unique and  major achievement in biology. Electron
              transfer in photosynthetic  proteins provides a paradigm for understanding the
              factors that  control the rapid movement of electrons on the nanometer scale,
              and  thus have greatly influenced thinking and prospects for molecular  scale
              electronic devices. This research focuses on understanding  the mechanism of
              the earliest, light driven electron transfer  reactions, the unique excited
              state properties that lead to  efficient charge separation, and the
              interactions between the  chlorophyll type molecules and their protein
              environment which  modulate the properties of these chromophores and uniquely 
              determine the direction of electron flow.  ***
