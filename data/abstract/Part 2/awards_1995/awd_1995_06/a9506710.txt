Abstract    :
              9506710  Burnley      The PI will determine whether or not conditions exist
              where  complete conversion of olivine to spinel by the martensitic-like 
              mechanism is possible under earth conditions by conducting  transformation
              experiments at high-pressure oversteps.  The  proposal will be a continuation
              of the reconnaissance study that  the PI has performed using the facilities at
              CHiPR in SUNY Stony  Brook.  ****
