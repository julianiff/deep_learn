Abstract    :
              SBR-9506132  This dissertation-improvement award is to fund a year of research
              in southern India.  The Student aims to compare three community-based
              nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Karnatka State to explore hypotheses
              about the relationships between fiscal autonomy and political "distance" from
              the state, on the one hand, and the structure, form, and organizational
              practices of NGOs.  The context of the research is the increased salience given
              this form of civil institution in industrializing societies.  India is the site
              of the extended case studies because of the importance of NGOs to current
              development strategies there.  The Student will compare the three NGOs along a
              set of detailed parameters, including household characteristics of
              participants, organizational structure and activities, and organizational
              impact.  A major purpose of the study is the impact of NGO practices within
              both the household and larger political spheres.
