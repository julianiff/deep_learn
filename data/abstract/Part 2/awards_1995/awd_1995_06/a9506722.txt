Abstract    :
              9506722  Stevenson           The PIs will develop models for Earth's thermal
              evolution that  differ from previous efforts in the extent to which they
              develop a  fully self-consistent picture of the interplay of various 
              convective processes (plates, plumes and "small scale" convection),  the extent
              to which they incorporate important physical processes  that are frequently
              omitted, and the number and diversity of  observables to which the models seek
              to make a connection.  The  approach is eclectic, involving specific pieces of
              physics that  require theoretical development, analytical scaling arguments and
               numerical convection experiments.  The PIs will specifically  include effects
              of small scale convection, the role of kinetics of  phase transitions, and the
              role of water in plate tectonics,  crustal production and mantle cooling.  ***
