Abstract    :
              Abstract  Edmund Seebauer    Surface diffusion on semiconductors is examined in
              this study using two experimental approaches and molecular dynamics.  The
              previously developed applications of second harmonic microscopy (SHM) for study
              of low-coverage surface diffusion in Group IV semiconductors is broadened to
              include III-V and II-IV materials.  This includes the first quantitative
              measurements of ion-enhanced surface diffusion.  The effort focusses on wide
              bandgap materials which may show very pronounced ionic effects on surface
              diffusion.  In addition, spatially unresolved second harmonic generation is
              used to test the general theory connecting surface diffusivities with reaction
              rate constants.  Initial experiments involve chlorine on silicon (111). 
              Extension to halogens or hydrogen on III-V or II-VI materials is planned if
              initial tests succeed. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations of the influence
              of adatoms on surface heterodiffusion are performed.    This is a basic study
              of the fundamentals of surface diffusion.  It has a broad range of potential
              relevance, including the processing of electronic materials, thin-film
              formation, heterogeneous catalysis, and corrosion protection.  ***
