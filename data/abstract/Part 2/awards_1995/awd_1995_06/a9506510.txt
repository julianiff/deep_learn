Abstract    :
              9506510  Rudnick  To investigate the influence of tectonic processes on cratonic
              lithosphere, a detailed examination of xenoliths both on and off the Tanzanian
              craton is planned.  Investigation of the petrography, mineral chemistry,
              thermobarometry, major and trace element geochemistry and, most importantly, Os
              isotopic compositions on selected xenoliths will serve to characterize the
              composition of the Tanzanian lithospheric mantle and the vertical and lateral
              extent of cratonic mantle.  Os isotopic measurements on whole rock and chromite
              mineral separates will constrain the minimum age of melt extraction in these
              rocks, hence timing of lithosphere formation.  In addition, the effects of
              silicate and carbonatite metasomatism on the Re-Os systematics in peridotites
              will be evaluated by comparison of the chromite results (which should yield the
              initial Os isotopic composition) with whole rock data, which may record
              enhancement of the Re/Os ratio due to metasomatic re-introduction of Re.  These
              petrologic and geochemical data will help constrain models of lithosphere
              structure derived from seismic and gravity surveys that are currently  underway
              in Tanzania.  Furthermore, integration of these new geophysical data with the
              petrological and geochemical studies outline here will allow delineation of the
              important processes involved in lithospheric mantle growth and modification.
