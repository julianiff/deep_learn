Abstract    :
              9506622  DREGER     This research is to extend modern techniques of analysis of
              large  earthquakes in southern and central California back to historical  times
              when only analog seismographic recordings were available.   While many of these
              regions are currently quiet, especially off of  the San Andreas fault, several
              historic large earthquakes have  occurred there and these are important to the
              estimation of seismic  hazard.  The longest-lived seismic stations in
              California are the  Berkeley BRK and MHC (since 1887), and the Caltech PAS and
              SBC  (since 1927) stations.  In addition, seismograms will be obtained  from
              other regional and teleseismic sites such as the De Bilt,  Netherlands and the
              Florissant, Missouri observatories.  The  technique involves the use of recent
              earthquakes recorded by modern  networks to compare with the historic data to
              obtain relative  locations, magnitude scaling, and to calibrate paths to each 
              station.  The resulting calibrated Green's functions will be used  to model the
              historic events for source depth, scalar seismic  moment, fault orientation and
              potential source complexity in the  larger historic earthquakes.  This research
              is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.    ***
