Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Peter Wells and a graduate student
              assistant will study archaeological materials in German museum collections.
              They will focus on artifacts which date to late pre Roman and early Roman
              periods, assess the nature and extent of these collections and use this
              information as the basis for the formulation of a larger project. These data
              will allow Dr. Wells to select potential sites for future excavation.  Between
              58 BC and 83 AD the Roman empire extended northwards into temperate Europe and
              incorporated local groups. Dr. Wells is interested in the process of
              incorporation and the kinds of changes and accommodations which are made by
              both cultures in this interaction. Limited historical documentation exists and
              these data will increase the potential contribution of the archaeological
              research. The work has the ultimate potential to add, not only to scientific
              understanding of cultural interaction between dominant and subservient groups
              but also to contribute to archaeological technique and methodology.
              Archaeologists attempt to reconstruct cultural process on the basis of
              excavated material remains and this can be complicated to do. In the Roman
              case, documents provide some historic control. Through study of the material
              correlates of Roman incorporation, Dr. Wells hopes to develop markers which may
              prove of interpretive use in other archaeological contexts.
