              Dissertation Improvement Research:  The Changing Geography of Employee Stock
              Ownership Plans, 1981-1991: Evaluating the Influence of Local Context on
              Corporate Decision-Making  This research evaluates two competing views that
              seek to explain the paucity of worker ownership in the American economy.  The
              first argues that worker ownership is feasible only in firms with very specific
              characteristics.  The second claims that while worker ownership is a viable
              proposition, the small number of firms exhibiting employee ownership results
              from the contexts in which the firms operate.  This research investigates the
              relative degree to which firm characteristics and changing local conditions
              account for the rise in employee ownership in the 1980s via employee stock
              ownership plans (EOSPs).  The study employs statistical modeling, to evaluate
              the interplay among firm characteristics and metropolitan-level conditions
              affecting the decision to implement EOSPs, and executive interviews to
              understand the role of business networks in th e spread of EOSPs. The project
              results will help better inform the theoretical debates concerning the relative
              importance of  firm characteristics versus contextual factors in the viability
              of  worker ownership and contribute to the discussion of the importance of
              changing labor relations in the American economy.
