Abstract    :
              9506660  Romanowicz   This award provides partial funding for the support of a
              computer manager in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and the
              Seismographic Station at the University of California-Berkeley. The computer
              manager will be responsible for maintaining a network of workstations in the
              Department and at the Seismographic Station. He will be responsible for the
              integration of the different elements of the network, installation of new
              hardware and software, maintenance of the network and i/o devices, as well as
              assisting users. The Seismographic Station and the geophysics group in the
              Department are engaged in a number of research and earthquake monitoring
              projects which require intensive use of the computer system.  ***
