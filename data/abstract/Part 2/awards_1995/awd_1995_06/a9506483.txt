Abstract    :
              9506483  Parise   This research will elucidate the factors that determine the
              strength of the H-bond in hydrous minerals and its effects on structure, phase
              transition behavior and elasticity.  The research approach will systematically
              isolate such factors as cation acidity, pressure and temperature as variables
              in a compound's ability to form hydrogen bonds and to determine crystal
              structure and elasticity as a function of these variables.  Studies will
              include structural measurements of dihydroxides at high pressure using in situ
              neutron and x-ray measurements, elasticity property measurements of the B
              series of high pressure hydrous phases using Brillouin scattering, and
              measurement of equations of state and dehydration behavior of these compounds
              and chlorite by in situ x-ray diffraction measurements.
