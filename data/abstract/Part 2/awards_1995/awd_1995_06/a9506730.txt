Abstract    :
              9506730  Plank  This project is an experimental study of the behavior of
              sediments in subduction zones.  A major question to be addressed is whether
              sediments melt or dehydrate beneath arc volcanoes.  Another goal is to
              determine rock/melt and rock/fluid distribution coefficients for important
              element tracers that can be used in quantitative models.  The proposed research
              will involve high pressure and high temperature laboratory experiments on
              natural pelitic samples and on metapelites.  The chemical compositions of
              aqueous solutes, melts and residual solid run products will be measured using a
              new experimental design derived from recent advances in experimental petrology
              combined with ultrasensitive analytical tools.  The data collected should
              generate further insights into (a)  the role of subducted sedimentary material
              in arc petrogenesis, and (2) the efficiency of crustal recycling throughout
              Earth history, and (3) the thermal structure of subducting slabs.
