Abstract    :
              9506612  Johnson  The proposed work will develop new thermal and mechanical
              melting models to explain the mantle dynamics that occur during continental
              extension, and tie these to new observations on the chemical, isotopic, and
              temporal evolution of extension related lavas (ERL) in the Death Valley
              volcanic field and adjacent areas.  Recent work has cast doubt on simple,
              previously proposed models of crust-mantle evolution during large-scale
              extension of the crust.  Preliminary isotope data, including Hf isotope
              analyses, provide important constraints on the depths of ancient and modern
              melting, metasomatism, and depletion events, and these data will be used to
              constrain thermal-mechanical models.  The large and highly extended volcanic
              field at Death Valley provides an exceptional opportunity to constrain and
              evaluate extensional thermal/melting models of the mantle.
