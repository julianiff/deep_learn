Abstract    :
              9506392  Farley  While the last decade has seen steady advances in measurement
              techniques and interpretation of the major volatiles (H2O, CO2) and the noble
              gases (He-Ne-Ar-Kr-Xe) in mantle-derived materials, simultaneous investigation
              of both sets of tracers has rarely been undertaken.  These species have similar
              yet systematically distinct geochemical affinities, and characterization of the
              interrelationships among them can provide unique new insights to both magmatic
              phenomena and to the origin of the chemical heterogeneity of the mantle.  This
              is a project to investigate the relationships among the elemental and isotopic
              abundances of volatile species in basalt glasses and mafic phenocrysts from
              several representative localities including spreading ridges and ocean islands.
               Simultaneous determination of these species will require development and
              exploitation of tools which are new to this branch of geochemistry, including
              laser extraction, spectroscopic determination of volatile abundances, and
              fully-automated gas-handling.
