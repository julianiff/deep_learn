Abstract    :
              9506557  Dey       The Department of Statistics at the University of 
              Connecticut proposes to purchase one networked Server  workstation which will
              be dedicated to support research in  mathematical statistics, complex
              statistical modeling and  statistical software development. In particular it
              will  support the work of D.K. Dey in the area of Bayesian  modeling, A.E.
              Gelfand in the area of Bayesian computation,  J. Glaz in the area of high
              dimensional scan statistics, N.  Ravishanker in the area of long memory time
              series analysis,  and R. Vitale in the area of convex geometry in stochastic 
              problems.
