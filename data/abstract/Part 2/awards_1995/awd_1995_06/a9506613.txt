Abstract    :
              9506613  Cormier    This grant provides $16,625 as partial support for an
              upgrade to  the computing facilities of the geophysical research group at the 
              University of Connecticut, Storrs.  The University will provide  an equal
              amount for the upgrade.  The geophysics computing  facility is the principal
              research facility for 2 geophysics  faculty (Vernon Cormier and Roelof
              Versteeg) and their students  working in the areas of deep Earth structure,
              seismic wave  propagation, seismic processing and inversion and environmental 
              geophysics.. The facility also serves geology faculty (Tim Byrne)  as the main
              computational resource for modeling regional  tectonics, and serves faculty and
              graduate students in general as  the-computational platform for Mathematica. 
              The PI, Cormier is  one of the leading minds in theoretical seismology and the
              co-PI,  Byrne is a leading expert in the tectonics of Japan.  Specifically, the
              upgrade will consist of a central UNIX server  (Sparc 20) with large memory and
              3 Mac Power PC's, which will  serve both as X-terminals and as standalone
              units. This equipment  will improve this group's ability to conduct
              simultaneous  research on problems in deep Earth structure, visualization, 
              modeling and inversion of geophysical data for problems in  environmental
              remediation and regional tectonics (e.g. plate  reconstructions and deformation
              simulations).  All purchased  equipment will be completely compatible with
              existing equipment  and will strongly improve the present computational and 
              visualization capabilities.    ***
