Abstract    :
              9506785  Morrison  Pneumococcal transformation is a naturally occurring,
              inducible gene replacement mechanism that is relatively simple and very
              efficient.  Competence for genetic transformation in pneumococcus
              (Streptococcus pneumoniae) occurs during a brief period of highly specialized
              protein synthesis, coordinated among all cells of an actively growing culture
              by a secreted 17-residue peptide pheromone.  During a period of approximately
              10-20 minutes, the competent cells can transport DNA into the cytoplasm and
              replace homologous genes I the chromosome very efficiently.  In identifying and
              cloning genes involved in this DNA-processing mechanisms, and in determining
              their roles, this study relies on standard genetic techniques and the efficient
              gene replacement provided by the natural transformation process itself, in
              combination with molecular methods in vitro, a rapid physical mapping method,
              and recombinant DNA cloning using new vectors in pneumococcus and in E. coli. 
              Induced genes are identified by insertion of a lacZ reporter gene.  These
              studies identify, map, clone, and sequence genes of this natural transformation
              system in two broad areas: (a) genes of the pathway that transports DNA into
              the cell and processes it for genetic recombination, and (b) genes regulating
              the induction of this pathway via a quorumsensing peptide signal.  %%%  This
              research provides an understanding of how bacteria naturally exchange genes. 
              It is therefore, useful in understanding how genes for new properties can
              appear in a bacterial population.  ***
