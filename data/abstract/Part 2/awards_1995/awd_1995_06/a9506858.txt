Abstract    :
              This conference will consist of a keynote address providing a history of
              amyloid, and nine formal sessions of oral presentations, as well as poster
              sessions, whose topics will include protein and beta sheet structure, protein
              aggregation during folding in vitro, bacterial inclusion bodies, prion
              particles, and anti-trypsin  deposition, clinical summaries of major amyloid
              diseases, structural basis of amyloid formation by  peptides, basis for 
              sequence dependence of amyloid formation by peptides and globular proteins, the
               amyloid pathway in Alzheimer s disease, physical methods for the study of
              insoluble protein complexes,  mechanisms of protein assembly, and factors
              associated with amyloid in vivo.    %%%   The primary goal of the FASEB Summer
              Research Conference is to bring together the cell biologists familiar with the
              biology of abnormal protein deposition with the molecular biologists and
              biophysicists who will ultimately establish an understanding of the molecular
              basis of these phenomena.. This new conference series will provide a forum to
              promote increased awareness of protein depositi on as a process that is not
              only biologically relevant, but also exhibits significant molecular structure
              and specificity. A  related goal is to stimulate interest among established and
              young investigators in doing research in  this area.
