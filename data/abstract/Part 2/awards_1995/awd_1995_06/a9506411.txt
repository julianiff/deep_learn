Abstract    :
              9506411  Harcombe    This proposal seeks funding for a two-day conference
              meeting in conjunction with the 38th Symposium of the International Association
              of Vegetation Scientists to be held in June 1995, in Houston, Texas.  The focus
              of the conference will be opportunities for basic research arising from efforts
              by federal agencies and non-governmental organizations to classify and map
              vegetation associations in large areas of the United States.  The main goals of
              the conference are to catalyze collaborations to take advantage of newly
              available data, to provide critical communication among scientists, to improve
              national vegetation classification efforts, and possibly to help fine-tune
              ongoing classification and mapping efforts.  The conference will focus the
              research agenda by addressing three questions:  1) How can academic ecologists
              respond to the national scientific need to address problems encountered in the
              national vegetation classification and mapping process?  2) What breakthroughs
              will become possible as a consequence of the rapid proliferation of information
              engendered by national classification and mapping efforts?  3) What new
              analytical, data management, and administrative tools will be necessary to
              ensure full realization of the potential afforded by the dramatic increase in
              ecological data?     The timing of this conference is ideal.  The IAVS meetings
              are the only ones in the world likely to bring together people doing
              cutting-edge research from many different, and somewhat isolated, areas and
              perspectives.  Hence they constitute a unique forum for discussion and dialog. 
              In fostering dialog between academic ecologists and resource managers, the
              conference will ensure that data are collected in such a way as to maximize
              their scientific utility, as well as their applied value.
