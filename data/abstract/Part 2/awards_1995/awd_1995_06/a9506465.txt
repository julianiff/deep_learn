Abstract    :
              9506465   Miller   This project will characterize the important vertical motions
              associated with the San Andreas transform fault system in the San Francisco Bay
              area. Current estimates of the amount of shortening and uplift associated with
              the fault in the San Francisco Bay area vary by up to an order of magnitude. An
              integrated study of fission track, geomorphic, geodetic and fault system
              modeling analysis will quantify the intense recent contraction and uplift. The
              data will be used to assess the importance of zones of intense vertical motions
              along faults and will be used to calibrate qualitative geomorphic indicators of
              uplift and fault movement with quantitative uplift magnitudes derived from
              fission track data and measured historic uplift patterns. The results will be
              of importance to all tectonically active regions of the world.
