Abstract    :
              9506039  Miller       This research project in communication protocols focuses
              on  the study of formal modeling of communication protocols which spans  the
              areas of protocol specification, verification, testing and  performance.  Goals
              of the project are to provide a unification of  the formulation techniques
              across all of these areas from  specification to testing and to add the
              capability of studying  performance within the same kind of formulation. 
              Currently the  approaches used to formally specify a protocol are different
              from  those used to verify the logical correctness of a protocol.  There  is
              also a gap between the verification formulations and the  conformance test
              generation formulations.  The research studies in  this project are aimed at
              closing these two gaps and thereby  providing a more integrated approach to the
              design of communication  protocols from specification to verification to
              testing.  In  addition, the studies aim to allow one to investigate the 
              performance of the protocol at an early stage of the design, again  using the
              same formulation techniques as in specification and  verification.  ***
