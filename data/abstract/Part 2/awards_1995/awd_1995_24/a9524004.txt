Abstract    :
              9417050  Delcourt  Landscapes change through time due to human activity and
              natural disturbances. Long-term changes in the landscape have generally been
              the domain of study for paleoecologists, while ecologists have focused on more
              recent characterization of landscapes. This study develops new ways to
              interface ecological and paleoecological data sets. This provides a means for
              projecting the impacts of future climate change and land-use change on the
              locations of ecological transition zones and the overall composition of the
              landscape.
