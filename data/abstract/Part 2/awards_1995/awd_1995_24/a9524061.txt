Abstract    :
              9524061  Vandermeer  Most global warming models predict an increased frequency
              and intensity of tropical storms.   The frequency of hurricanes will almost
              certainly have a long-term effect on the biodiversity of tropical rain forests.
                Understanding the details of post-hurricane succession will enable a more
              accurate assessment of the exact nature of these impacts on biodiversity.  This
              project continues an ongoing project which has followed recovery and reassembly
              of a tropical forest since Hurricane Joan struck in 1988.  The forest is now
              entering a new phase of recovery where competition has become more intense and
              competitive thinning is beginning as the forest enters another stage of
              succession.  Measurements of tree diameters and crown heights of a large number
              of marked trees will test several theories of competitive thinning. 
              Biodiversity will be measured for arthropods, and physical and chemical factors
              will be followed in the soils and at ground level.  This research will provide
              a basis on which to predict the biodiversity consequences of increased
              hurricane frequencies.
