Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9524970    This proposal attempts to develop an environmentally
              acceptable and economically viable process to separate magentically zinc iron
              in the dust produced in certain steel making operations.  The PI proposes to
              promote the magentic separation of the zinc in the form of zinc ferrite
              (ferrimagnetic) from the iron by conversion of the zinc ferrite to paramagnetic
              zinc oxide by a heat treatment process.
