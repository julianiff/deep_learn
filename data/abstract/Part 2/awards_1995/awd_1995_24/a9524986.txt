Abstract    :
              This award in the Chemistry Division supports research by Dr. James M.   Tanko
              of the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and   State
              University, on the use of supercritical fluids as environmentally   benign
              solvents for chemical reactions.  The award is made in the   Technology for a
              Sustainable Environment activity of the 1995 NSF/EPA   Partnership for
              Environmental Research.  Carbon dioxide and fluoroform   will be examined for
              their potential as solvents for radical reactions.    Both solvents are
              expected to be inert toward free radicals and are known   to become
              supercritical at moderate temperatures and pressures.  The   goals of the
              project are to identify the scope and limitations of radical   reactions
              amenable to supercritical fluid conditions, to develop new   synthetic methods
              for the synthesis of high-value organic materials, and   to explore the
              implications of the use of supercritical fluids for   fundamental physical
              principles of organic reactivity.  Many organic reactions proceed by a
              mechanism which involves a reactive   species with an unpaired electron called
              a free radical.  Example   reactions are those involving addition of chlorine
              or bromine to   hydrocarbons or lengthening of hydrocarbon chains.   In these
              reactions,   it is important that the solvent not react with the free radical. 
              Often   the solvent also plays a role in the formation of the radical species. 
                 In many cases benzene and carbon tetrachloride are effective solvents for  
              such reactions, but they are environmentally harmful.   In this research   two
              alternate solvents which are environmentally benign will be tested   for
              suitability in organic reactions involving free radicals.
