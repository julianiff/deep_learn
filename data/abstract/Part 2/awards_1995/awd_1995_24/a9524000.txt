Abstract    :
                An interdisciplinary meeting entitled "Phylogenetic and Structural  Relations
              among  Proteins" sponsored by the Wadsworth Center, the State University of 
              New York at Albany and the Nucleic Acid Technologies Foundation will be  held
              September 28October 1, 1995 in Rensselaerville, New York. The  meeting will be
              the third in the series of Albany conferences on  Computational Biology. The
              aim of this conference is to explore the  computational tools and approaches
              being developed in diverse fields  within biology, with emphasis this year on
              phylogeny as apparent in  relationships on the molecular level. The theme of
              the conference will  be developed in five sessions: (1) 3-D Structural
              Relationships Among  Proteins, (2) Sequence-Structure Interface, (3) Data
              Bases, and (4 and  5) Phylogenetic Methods and Protein Trees. The conference
              participants  will be comprised of mathematicians, computer scientists and
              molecular  biologists.
