Abstract    :
              9524972  Sheng   Machining processes that are energy-efficient and
              environmentally conscious are both an ecological goal and a competitive
              advantage.  This research will develop an analytical approach and methodology
              for making the trade-offs between the traditional manufacturing parameters of
              production rate, quality and flexibility and the new paradigms of energy and
              waste minimization.  The key concepts in this research are: environmental
              indicators for characterizing machining waste streams, second law thermodynamic
              concepts to indicate manufacturing process efficiency, process models to assess
              operational decisions, and the impact on the environment of component design
              and processing.  The research will be performed by an interdisciplinary team
              with expertise in design, processes, thermodynamics, process planning,
              environmental evaluation, and risk assessment.  Active involvement and support
              by industry, and a plan for the dissemination of the latest results on the
              World-Wide Web will ensure transfer of research results.  The immediate impact
              of this research will be on the discrete parts manufacturing industries,
              providing the planning and design tools to be competitive in global markets.
