Abstract    :
              Rivers play a critical role in global systems because they transfer materials 
              regionally and from land to the sea.  The investigators developed a model for
              the Amazon river that  describes and predicts river interactions with
              terrestrial and coastal systems.  The model  incorporates both large- and
              small-scale information in a unified database (e.g. satellite imaging to 
              biochemical parameters).  In the present research, the investigators will
              extend the model to the  rivers of the Pacific rim.   Rivers of the Pacific rim
              were chosen because of their complex, but under  appreciated role in global
              biogeochemical cycles.  The central question is: How do these poorly- 
              understood rivers obtain, modify and transport their biogeochemical
              composition?  To address the  question, the PIs will 1) assemble an
              international team of investigators, 2) collect, analyze and  disseminate
              samples and information for several Pacific rim rivers, and 3) develop a
              heuristic model  of the operation and importance of these rivers.
