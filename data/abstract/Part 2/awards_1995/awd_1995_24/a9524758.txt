Abstract    :
              9524758  Govindaraju  This proposal deals with the development of a
              geomorphological artificial neural network (GANN) model for predicting the
              nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationships of watersheds.  GANN represents a
              massively interconnected network of processing units called neurons.  The
              network is characterized by weights, which determine the strength of each
              connection, and the threshold values of neurons which dictate their activation
              level.  The network of overland flow planes, streams and subsurface flow
              pathways, which drains the water from the watershed, will be mapped into the
              topology of artificial neural networks (ANNs).  This model will draw on
              strengths of the geomorphological representations of the watershed, and will
              also be capable of capturing the nonlinear response of watersheds to
              precipitation events.  GANN models will be further utilized to study the
              influence of temporal and spatial scales, and to investigate the significance
              of various surface and subsurface flow pathways.    The performance of GANN
              models will be tested in several ways.  Four watersheds in Kansas have been
              identified based on size and availability of data for rainfall, soils,
              temperature, topography, and other variables which govern water movement within
              the watershed.  The network will be trained using a portion of the data. 
              Simultaneously, a physically-based model and a regression-based empirical model
              will be calibrated using the same historical record.  These models will then be
              tested in prediction mode through the remaining portion of the rainfall-stream
              flow records.  This will not only help evaluate the GANN model in terms of how
              well it predicts stream flow given rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature
              records, but will also form a basis for comparing its performance with respect
              to other types of models.  ***
