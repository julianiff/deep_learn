Abstract    :
              Public agencies and corporate landholders are developing and maintaining major 
              environmental databases for computerized mapping and analysis. The cost of 
              such databases increases  rapidly with increasing spatial detail.  This project
              undertakes the development of objective and  efficient methods for determining
              patterns of spatial variation from such databases - particularly  relating to
              water resources and landscape ecology - and for making pattern comparisons
              between  databases having different levels of detail.  Comparison of patterns
              emerging from data at different  levels of detail will enable managers to
              select the appropriate spatial resolution necessary for  particular purposes. 
              Cost efficiency will also be increased by the ability to indicate likely zones 
              of spatial uncertainty and detect areas of disagreement between alternate
              hydrologic models, so that  detailed data acquisition can be better targeted
              and modeling will be more precise.  Application of  these approaches will
              provide a better basis for districting watersheds, reducing the costs of 
              monitoring and detecting the need  for remediation.
