Abstract    :
              9524058  Reynolds  Predicting the Response of Terrestrial Ecosystems to Elevated
              CO2 and Climate Change: A Modeling and Experimental Collaboration  As a result
              of increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2, the global climate of the
              Earth is predicted to change in the future more rapidly than it has over any
              comparable period of human history. This change is expected to have significant
              impacts on both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Society's ability to
              prepare for such changes depends in part on our success in developing
              predictive simulation models of ecosystem responses that have sufficient
              confidence and lead time. This study will test the strengths and weaknesses of
              a suite of existing ecosystem models by comparing their predictions to two
              on-going terrestrial field projects. One of these projects is a study of the
              effect of rising CO2 on carbon accumulation and nutrient cycling in a scrub-oak
              ecosystem in Florida and the other is a study of regional and seasonal
              variation in CO2 fluxes in northern Russia. Both of these field projects will,
              in turn, benefit from the development and application of these models to test
              hypotheses concerning the effect of elevated CO2 and climate on carbon budgets
              of terrestrial ecosystems. This research is an important "next step" in our
              efforts to build and apply models to develop a better understanding of the
              effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.  ??
