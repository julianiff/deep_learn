Abstract    :
              9524041  Li  Trace Gas Emissions and Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural
              Lands in the US and China  Agricultural ecosystems are perhaps the most dynamic
              of terrestrial ecosystems on our planet. There is a very strong linkage between
              carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics and agricultural management practices
              (e.g. fertilization, tillage, manure amendment, and irrigation).  In both China
              and the US, efforts are underway to modify agricultural management to enhance
              soil fertility and reduce soil degradation and environmental pollution. Impacts
              of agricultural management on soil C and N dynamics will depend on climate,
              soil properties, and agricultural practices.  A process-oriented model will be
              used for prediction of the influence of climate, soil conditions and cropping
              practices on soil C and N storage and trace gas fluxes. This study will
              generate estimates of (1) current soil organic C and N pools, (2) emissions of
              carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO),
              and ammonia (NH3) from agricultural lands, (3) trends of changes in soil
              organic C, and (4) impacts of changing agricultural management practices on
              trace gas fluxes and soil C sequestration in the US and China.  ??
