              OPP-9524740  PETERSON, BRUCE                                ABSTRACT    One of
              the expected effects of global climate change on the Arctic is a dramatic
              change in the freshwater balance.  Changes in freshwater input to the Arctic
              Ocean will affect sea ice formation, wetland and ocean productivity, and
              thermohaline circulation in the world's ocean.  In spite of the importance of
              freshwater runoff to the Arctic and global climate, a contemporary data set for
              the entire Arctic has never been compiled.  This project will use examine data
              from North American sources and Russian sources to quantify the contemporary
              water balance and the annual variability of that balance.  The water runoff
              data will be used in models to estimate the flux of sediment and nutrients from
              the continents to the adjacent seas.  This contemporary, baseline data set and
              model will be used to judge the likely impacts of predicted climate change on
              circumarctic water and nutrient balances and will provide a means for
              estimating contaminant pathways and potential impacts.  The results of this
              research project will provide a benchmark against which future climate changes
              may be assessed.
