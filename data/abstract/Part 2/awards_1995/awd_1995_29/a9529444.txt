Abstract    :
              CDA  9529444  Nau, Dana  Hendler, James    University of Maryland at College
              Park    CISE Research Instrumentation for AI Planning Research      The
              Department of Computer Science and the Institute for Systems Research at the
              University of Maryland will purchase computing machining equipment, including a
              small multipurpose machine tool, a pentium-based personal computer for solid
              modeling and input to the tool, and a large disk drive for keeping large
              case-based planning libraries, all of which will be dedicated to support
              artificial intelligence research in the area of computer and information
              science and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular:       *AI-based planning for manufacturing, 
                *High Performance Support for Large Knowledge Bases,     *Combination of
              generative and case-based reuse techniques in AI      planning, and    
              *Low-cost robotics.      In addition, a CAD tool will be donated by Bentley
              Systems Inc. to facilitate experimentation with the AI planning techniques in
              the manufacturing domain.
