                University of Iowa    Instrumentation for Virtual Environments Integrating
              Dynamics and Real-Time Interactivity    The equipment for high-speed
              computation and real-time image generation is used for a coordinated set of
              research projects attacking the computational requirements of interactive,
              real-time simulation with rich physical and behavioral interactions.  The
              research focuses on four related areas:  (1)  Merging geometric analysis,
              dynamic analysis, and control programming for interactive, real-time multibody
              simulation; (2) Numerical methods for fast, accurate solution and integration
              of motion equations; (3) Scenario authoring and behavior modeling for 
              semiautonomous  agents; and (4) Distributed, real-time systems.  building on
              existing facilities, the instrumentation provides a combination of compute
              power, graphics power, interaction hardware, and workstations to support
              real-time simulation and virtual environments research.
