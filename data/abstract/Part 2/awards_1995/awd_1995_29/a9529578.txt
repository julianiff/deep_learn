Abstract    :
              Abstract - Joseph and Motard - 9529578    Many chemical plants have distributed
              computer control systems (DCS) which collect time series data from thousands of
              sensors.  The data contained in this past operational history is used to
              monitor, control and optimize the plant operation.  The objective of this work
              is to develop and test tools and algorithms for extracting information from
              time series data generated by on-line process sensors.  Information extraction
              tasks include converting raw sensor data to meaningful process variables,
              identifying process models such as input-output transfer functions, monitoring
              the status of plant operation and detection of abnormal events.    The PIOs
              will investigate the problem at the sensor level, the unit level and the plant
              level.  Specific issues addressed by this project include: (I) the problem of
              sensor fingerprinting, i.e. the problem of extracting information about the
              underlying process phenomena from the raw signal generated by the sensor, (ii)
              the problem of improving the accuracy of parameters in process models generated
              from noisy input/output time series data by selective prefiltering to maximize
              the signal to noise ratio, and (iii) the problem of event detection and
              generation of an event data base containing information needed to monitor and
              diagnose performance of the plant from various points of view including
              quality, control, economics, environmental, maintenance, and fault detection.
