Abstract    :
              Jan Labanowski is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to enhance the development of an   Information Resource for
              Computational Chemistry.   This grant is made   within the Information
              Infrastructure and Technical Applications (IITA)   portion of the High
              Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)   strategic research area. 
              This resource facilitates the communication and   collaboration of research
              scientists in the area of computational   chemistry throughout the world.  The
              Computational Chemistry Listserver   is an important research infrastructure
              tool for over 2250 subscribers in   50 countries.  The catalytic support
              provided through this grant will   enable Labanowski to carry out a number of
              innovative experiments  which   will result in a better moderated,
              fully-archived listserver.  Software   will be adapted or developed to handle
              the administration and supervision   of the service in a distributed
              environment, and to provide improved   access to the message archives.  The
              Internet is having a tremendous impact on the field of computational  
              chemisty.  The sharing of new ideas in a global community is now possible   on
              a daily interactive basis.   Scientists can now engage in long   distance
              electronic collaborations on a full time basis.  The   Computational Chemistry
              Listserver provides a vital communication   infrastructure for the global
              community of computational chemists who   wish to share theoretical and
              computational ideas, algorithms, and   software.
