Abstract    :
              9529752  Rudnick    This  project will observe temperature (T) and salinity (S)
              in  the  upper  ocean  and  evaluate  competing  hypotheses  about  how  T-S 
              variability  along  isopyclals, introduced by  surface  fluxes  and  advection,
              is reduced to establish a T-S relationship. This area of  investigation is of
              great importance to understanding  near-surface  processes  and  their
              relationship to the large-scale  circulation,  but  remains  virtually 
              unexplored. Recent developments  in  towed  vehicles  make this exploration
              possible now. Changes  in  the  T-S  relationship  and the density ratio with
              changing horizontal  scale  will  be key elements in distinguishing competing
              theories  of  T-S  regulation. Field data will be obtained using a
              depth-controllable,  towed  vehicle (SeaSoar) equipped with T, S, and pressure 
              sensors.  Three different sampling strategies (constant depth, isopycnal, and 
              sawtooth) will be employed during a series of long (1000 km) tows.  ***
