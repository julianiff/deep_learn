Abstract    :
              9529707  Phipps Moran         This project is a pilot teleseismic surface wave
              study with  the goal of mapping the source of the Hawaiian swell. During a 9- 
              month deployment an array of eight ocean-bottom seismometers will  collect
              Rayleigh wave dispersion data from circum-Pacific plate  bourdary earthquakes.
              A 3-D interpretation of these data will give  constraints on the lithosphere
              and upper asthenosphere shear-  velocity structure beneath the Hawaiian swell.
              If this pilot  experiment is successful a larger experiment would be proposed
              to  determine which of the three hypotheses for the formation of the  swell is
              correct.
