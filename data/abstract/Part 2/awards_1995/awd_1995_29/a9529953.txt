Abstract    :
              9529953  Kastner        Fluid and solid samples will be analyzed for Cl
              concentration and  isotopic composition from six sites in three geologically, 
              sedimentology, and hydrologically different subduction systems:  Barbados,
              Nankai, and Mariana. On the basis of previous extensive  geologic, mineralogic,
              chemicals, and isotopic characterizations,  samples of pore waters, sediments,
              altered basalts, and their  related mineral separates have been carefully
              selected for this  study. Emphasis will be placed on the important and abundant
              ocean  floor hydrous silicates, especially clay minerals (e.g., smectite, 
              illite, chlorite), other micas, serpentine, talc, and amphibole.   Potential
              precursor phases of authigenic hydrous minerals will also  be analzyed (e.g.
              volcanic arc glass and tuffs). This new data set  will be interpreted in terms
              of kinetic isotopic enrichment (i.e.,  diffusion), advective mass transport,
              and fluid-rock reaction  models and applied to processes occuring in convergent
              margins.
