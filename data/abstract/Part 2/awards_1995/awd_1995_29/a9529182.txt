Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9529182    The objective of this research is the investigation of
              the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over cobalt-nickel Fischer-Tropsch
              catalysts supported on a series of mixed oxides, including manganese-zirconium
              oxide, manganese-vanadium oxide, and niobium-zirconium oxide.  A major interest
              is the yield and selectivity in the gasoline range - C5 to C11 hydrocarbons. 
              The supported catalysts are tested alone as well as in combination with
              hydrogen-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite.  The effects of process variables such as
              temperature,  pressure, space velocity, carbon monoxide/hydrogen ratio, and
              zeolite/catalyst ratio on steady-state product distributions are also
              investigated.    This award to a historically black college is made under the
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions announcement.  The research is relevant
              to the production of gasoline from nonpetroleum sources such as coal, natural
              gas or biomass.
