Abstract    :
              9529554  Fernandez       This  award provides funds  to purchase a CODAR 
              SeaSonde ocean surface current radar system that will be  used in conjunction
              with existing components of a larger  radar network at UCSC.  The existing
              network  of CODAR  sensors consists of three radars located  at  Point Pinos, 
              Moss Landing, and the Long Marine  Laboratory. A three-point  system allows
              thePI's to resolve errors and uncertainties in  the data that  are impossible
              to resolve  wtih a one or two  radar system.  The radar located at Moss Landing
              isan older  model that generates data more slowly  than the newer  versions. 
              (Subsequent to submission of  this proposal, the  older radar malfunctioned
              beyond  repair and is no longer  available.)  The  PI's proposes to replace the
              older model  of the radar with the newer CODAROcean Sensor  (COS) radar.  This
              equipmentwill  be used to support  research projects  that are focused on
              improving measurements of coastal  circulation in Monterey Bay. The University
              of California,  Santa Cruz  has offered cost-sharing of $30,000  for this 
              award.  ***
