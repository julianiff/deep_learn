Abstract    :
                  9529295  Montgomery     When an isolated vortex is subject to
              non-axisymmetric forcing, an adjustment process ensues.  Adjustment consists of
              an excitation of gravity waves and shear waves, but surprisingly little is
              known about the near-field wave-mean flow interaction that accompanies it.  A
              fundamental question in cyclone dynamics is the extent of the coupling between
              a large-scale vortex and small-scale excitations confined near the radius of
              maximum winds.  In the realm of non-axisymmetric dynamics, a possibility exists
              for mean flow acceleration by sheared disturbances.  Shear-induced acceleration
              represents an unexplored mechanism for vortex growth at subsynoptic scales that
              may contribute significantly to cyclone development in tropical cyclones and
              extratropical marine cyclones.     In his recent work, the principal
              investigator (PI) identified and analyzed a class of vortex Rossby waves that
              owe their existence to the radial gradient of storm vorticity.  The initial
              studies were done in a non-ditergent flow framework.  The PI will now explore
              the impact of such waves on cyclone development under more realistic
              conditions.  The focus of the new work will be on understanding and quantifying
              the impact of both vortex-Rossby waves and gravity-inertia waves on the
              near-field wave-mean flow dynamics accompanying the adjustment process. 
              Investigative techniques will be both analytical and computational.    ***
