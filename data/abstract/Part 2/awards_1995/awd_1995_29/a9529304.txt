Abstract    :
                CDA 95-29304  Kaiser, Gail E.  Duchamp, Daniel J.    Columbia University   
              Semantics-based Prefetching for Mobile Computing    This proposal investigates
              collaborative workflow environments, and previously constructed an
              infrastructure that assumes conventional high-speed networking.  Professor
              Kaiser is developing new algorithms and techniques to support mobile hosts. 
              The research addresses prefetching based on semantic information on what the
              user is likely to do next drawn from the workflow definition tailoring the
              specific environment instance, to permit low-bandwidth and temporarily detached
              operation by participants in collaborative enterprises.  Professor Duchamp is
              developing operating system support for intelligently prefetching files from a
              file system or objects from an objectbase.  The goal is to improve performance
              and automate cache loading prior to disconnecting from the network, via two
              types of prefetching: The first is performed by the file system, transparent to
              applications; the file system ``learns'' file access patterns and uses these
              patterns to prefetch if/when the patterns recur.  The second type of
              prefetching is application-directed; applications with knowledge of their
              future data accesses can use a special interface to instruct the operating
              system what to prefetch.  Professor Kaiser's workflow system is the major
              example application for this type of prefetching.  Both the collaborative work
              and operating systems directions require mobile notebook computers for
              development, testing, and measurement of the prototype support.
