Abstract    :
              9529601    Sturges    This project is an individual contribution to a major
              study of  the  North  Atlantic  to  be  carried out as part  of  the  World 
              Ocean  Circulation  Experiment  (WOCE).  The PI  will  develop  a  way  to 
              separate  the low-frequency (3-10 year) wind-driven variability  in  meridional
               flow  in the North Atlantic from the  higher  frequency  fluctuations  forced 
              by transients in the wind.   A  simple  model  using wind curl forcing in the
              open ocean will be used to determine  sea  level  variability and to compare it
              with  observations.   The  results  will be used to "de-alias" data from
              hydrographic sections  taken many years apart.
