Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9529455    This is a cooperative research effort between the
              University of California at Davis and the Ford Motor Company.  It is an
              investigation of a new class of supported metal catalyst consisting of a noble
              metal (platinum or palladium) bonded to an oxide support (magnesia, alumina, or
              silica) by means of a strong interaction with an oxophilic metal (chromium,
              molybdenum, or tungsten).  The intent is to maintain high dispersion in
              clusters smaller than one nanometer.  The catalysts are prepared from
              organmetallic clusters in which the noble and oxophilic metals are bonded to
              each other.  The supported bimetallic structures are characterized structurally
              and used to catalyze a series of test reactions including   n-hexane
              dehydrocyclization, 3-methyl-2-butenal hydrogenation, and selective nitric
              oxide reduction.  A practical goal is the establishment of stability limits for
              these catalysts with respect to temperature and composition of the reactant gas
              stream, and to ultimately lay down a foundation for the rational design of
              supported bimetallic catalysts.    Bimetallic catalysts are used in a number of
              very demanding industrial and environmental applications including liquid fuels
              production, synthesis gas conversion, and automotive exhaust control.  This
              effort lays the groundwork for a new generation of catalysts with better
              selectivity and longer life.
