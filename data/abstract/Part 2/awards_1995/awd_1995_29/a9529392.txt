Abstract    :
              The PI will focus on high-frequency (HF) radio wave modification of the F-region
              ionosphere using the upgraded HF facility near Arecibo.  He will pay particular
              attention to fundamental wave-plasma interactions in the ionospheric medium and
              the use of controlled ionospheric perturbations to elucidate natural aeronomic
              processes.  The research will be timed with the solar sunspot cycle so that
              experiments can be performed in two distinct ionospheric environments:  the
              nighttime, summer ionosphere (providing a highly stable plasma for controlled
              experimentation), and the nighttime, winter ionosphere (low collisional loss
              rates give rise to macroscale temperature/electron density modifications). 
              Basic plasma processes the PI will address include the resonant excitation of
              Langmuir oscillations and ion waves, so he can fully explore wave-plasma
              interactions in the 50-ms interaction interval following turn-on of the HF beam
              in a cold unmodified plasma.  He will advance current theories beyond the first
              50 ms of modification by investigating how HF-induced plasma
              irregularities/structures impact wave propagation and altering the evolutionary
              path of the plasma turbulence.  The PI will examine plasma transport phenomena
              and elastic/inelastic electron collision frequencies in the nighttime
              ionosphere with HF-induced perturbations.  The array of observations this
              project proposes will be made mainly at Arecibo, but with supplementary
              processors from GRI.
