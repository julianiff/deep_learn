Abstract    :
              AST  95-29324         Quasars, as the most distant known objects in the 
              universe, probe the universe back to the time when it was  less that 10% of its
              present age. However, there remain many  questions about the nature of quasar
              evolution. To resolve  some of these questions, a new, deep multicolor survey
              for  quasars and AGNs has been undertaken with a large format CCD  and the KPNO
              4-m telescope. Photometrically calibrated  images in six filters ranging from
              034 to 0.86 um and  covering 0.83 sq. deg down to B = 23.8 have been obtained 
              and reduced. A catalog of over 21,000 stellar objects with  magnitudes or upper
              limits and error estimates in all the  filters has been assembled. Some
              follow-up spectroscopy has  also been obtained for selected objects. In this
              program,  the data analysis will be completed and the data published  and made
              available to the astronomical community. In  addition, further spectroscopic
              observations will be made to  determine the properties and evolution of both
              high redshift  quasars and quasars/AGNs near redshift 2, where a  determination
              of the luminosity function will provide  significant constraints on models of
              quasar evolution.  Infrared observations will be used to investigate the 
              possible evolution of the continuum and emission-line  spectra of high-redshift
              quasars. The nature and abundances  of the compact, narrow emission-line
              galaxies will be  studied to determine their chemical history and evolutionary 
              state.
