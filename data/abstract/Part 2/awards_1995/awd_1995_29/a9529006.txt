Abstract    :
              The  proposed work creates human language resources to  stimulate  research   in
               three  important  areas:  (a)  automatic  language  identification--  the
              problem of identifying the  language  being  spoken;   (b)   robust  speech 
              recognition--  the   problem   of  recognizing  speech  from  different 
              microphones,  communication  channels,   and   environmental  conditions;  and 
               (c)   speaker  recognition-- the problem of identifying a speaker based  on 
              his  or  her  voice characteristics.  To support research in automatic 
              language  identification, over two minutes  of  speech  from  300  speakers  in
              each of twenty two language is being collected.   To  support  research  in
              robust recognition, about  two  minutes  of  cellular   speech  from  several 
              thousand  speakers   is   being  collected.   To  support research in speaker
              recognition,  twelve  hundred   speakers  are  providing  speech  samples 
              during   ten  telephone  calls  over a two year period.  For each  corpus,  the
               speech  is  annotated orthographically, and  a  portion  of  each  corpus   is
               transcribed  phonetically.   A  critical  need   for  annotated  speech 
              corpora  is met by  this  work:  to  stimulate  research  in  three important
              areas of human language technology,  leading to secure access to the
              information highway by any person  who speaks a language.
