Abstract    :
              The investigators' research in multiple reference point models of  information 
              petrieval  (IR) has led  to  the  development  of  a  collection  of  visual
              information retrieval  interfaces  (VIRIs)  embodying  different  approaches to
               visualizing  similarity  and  semantic  relations among documents. These VIRIs
              are intended  to  aid  users  in  retrieval and organization of online
              information.  VIRIs  based  on visualization of Boolean/set operations  (BIRD),
               distance measures in a reduced space defined by reference  points  (GUIDO), 
              similarity  with respect to multiple  reference  points  (VIBE),  and 
              similarity defined jointly by distance and  angular  separation  (DARE)  have
              been developed.  User  studies  will  be  conducted  with these VIRIs in order
              to: 1) improve usability  of  their  interfaces,  2)  investigate conceptual 
              accessibility  of  different  visualizations to potential user populations, 
              and  3)  evaluate  utility  of  the  VIRIs  for  prototypical  information 
              retrieval and organization tasks. These studies will provide  the  first 
              systematic  investigation of the  usefulness  of  document  space 
              visualizations to expected user populations for a  variety  of  information
              retrieval and organization tasks.  The  interface  features enhancing VIRI
              usability, and information visualizations  demonstrating  usefulness are
              expected to  augment  hypertext  as  mechanisms for organizing and accessing
              online information.
