Abstract    :
                9529779  Aye     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project   is
              to develop a new volumetric three-dimensional (VTD) display   based on the
              switchable binary optical element (SBOE) concept.   Current direct view
              volumetric displays have limitations in   their performance due to mechanical
              movement of the display   screens, which can be overcome in the proposed VTD
              display.   In this concept, a 2-D array of surface printed binary optical 
              elements (BOEs) are coated with a rapidly switchable Ferro-  electric liquid
              crystal layer. A stack of these arrays form   the volume medium of the display.
              Each BOE, which forms a   volume pixel (voxel) element, can be rapidly switched
              on   and off while a 3 color (RGB) low power laser beam is scanned   across the
              display volume. When in an unswitched state, the   medium will be transparent.
              while in a switched state. the   scanning laser beam will be diffracted and
              diffused into a   cone shape from the switched voxel elements. In order to  
              produce a 3D image, the scanned laser beam is modulated   while scanned over
              the BOE plane. It is anticipated that   this research will result in a
              real-time flicker-free 3D   volume display prototvpe without any moving parts. 
               The proposed VTD system will be extremely valuable for   true 3D display
              technology. Commercial applications of this   VTD technology will be in
              entertainment (ie, video games),   medical imaging, CAD/CAM, surveillance
              photogrammetry,   training and simulation, air traffic control, molecular  
              modeling, telerobotics and cockpit or shipboard displays.
