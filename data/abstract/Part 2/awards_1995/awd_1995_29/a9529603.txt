Abstract    :
              9529603  Holloway      This grant provides funds to design, develop,  construct
              and test an artificial fumarole to be  used for testing gas sensors, kinetic
              studies and  high temperature gas flow studies at Arizona State  University. 
              The PI's have already developed a  prototype artificial fumarole which has
              reached  sustainable temperatures of 450 C while the  proposed instrument would
              be designed to reach  temperatures of up to 900 C.  The experiment  proposed
              should allow improvement in present  fumarole monitoring capabilities and may
              enhance  our knowledge of fumarole gas compositional  changes directly
              preceding explosive volcanic  eruptions.  ***
