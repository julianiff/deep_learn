Abstract    :
              The key objective of this research project is to discover principles that
              underlie and enable the semantic interoperation of heterogeneous information
              systems.  Such systems comprise widely diverse and locally autonomous
              components with potentially intricate mutual constraints.  A major technical
              challenge is to design activities that may execute over a number of components,
              but nevertheless preserve the global semantic requirements, i.e., the integrity
              of the information at large.  This research project addresses the above
              challenge by (a) innovating representations that capture the semantics of data
              and activities in a unified mathematical framework; (b) developing techniques
              for reasoning about the above semantics to derive the maximally relaxed
              semantic constraints on data; (c) formulating design rules through which
              complex activities can be systematically specified; and (d) implementing the
              design rules in a prototype automated reasoning tool to assist in capturing and
              validating specifications of heterogeneous activities.  A centerpiece of this
              project is the evaluation and iterative refinement of the developed techniques
              with respect to a taxonomy of problems.  Continuous evaluation, greatly
              facilitated by the automated reasoning tool, is essential for discovering the
              lasting scientific principles of semantic interoperation.
