Abstract    :
              Rapid prototyping systems composed of programmable gate arrays present many 
              technical challenges affecting system utilization and performance.  The
              objective  of this research is the development of engineering methodologies
              which address  these currently unresolved technical issues.  Current rapid
              prototyping systems  suffer several shortcomings, including engineering
              bottlenecks caused by time-  consuming mapping processes, inadequate
              performance for real-time emulation of  high-speed systems, and high cost
              resulting from poor system utilization due to  the severe IO limit of
              programmable devices.  The proposed research targets these  key areas.  Both
              hardware and CAD algorithm issues will be addressed.  The  proposed project
              will contribute to identify the bottlenecks of current  prototyping systems and
              discovering novel solutions.  This research will  contribute to faster mapping
              processes, low cost - high utilization systems, and  real-time emulation.
