Abstract    :
              9529950  Sitharam  This project funds the speaker and participant costs for a 
              special session, titled ``Foundations and Mathematical  Aspects of Computer
              Science'', of the Central Section of the  American Mathematical Society, Kent
              State University,  November 3 -- 4, 1995. The purpose of this special session 
              is to encourage interaction between mathematicians and the  more theoretical
              computer scientists.  Such interaction is  currently rare, and would benefit
              both communities: the  process of formalizing and solving many challenging
              problems  that arise in computer science theory not only benefits from  the
              mathematical formulation but often requires the  development of new and deep
              mathematics. The aim of this  session is to create awareness of these special
              connections  and problems, and to open communication channels with 
              mathematicians attending the AMS Meeting. In fact, both the  formal session
              (with talks that outline problems in such  areas as algorithms, complexity
              theory, computational  learning theory, computational geometry, parallel
              computing  models, probabilistic and randomized computation,and  computer
              security and cryptography), and the planned open  problem sessions (for an
              interchange of solution techniques  and problems) should facilitate
              interdisciplinary  collaborations between mathematicians and computer 
              scientists.    There are three NSF programs which are split funding this 
              project: Theory of Computing Program of CCR, Computational  Mathematics Program
              of DMS, and Algebra and Number Theory  Program of DMS.  ***
