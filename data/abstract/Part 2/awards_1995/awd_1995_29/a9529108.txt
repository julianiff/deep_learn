                Support for a Workshop on Reinforcement Learning          This  is  support
              for a workshop that will  bring  together  researchers in one of the most
              actively studied paradigms in  the  study of human and machine learning,
              reinforcement learning (RL).  A  three-day  meeting  of  up to 30 leading 
              researchers  from  a  variety  of fields, including machine learning, neural 
              networks,  artificial intelligence, robotics, and operations research,  will 
              attend  the  meeting.  The  goals  of  the  meeting  include  (1) 
              Understanding  limitations of current RL  systems,  and  defining  promising 
              directions for further research;  (2)  Clarifying  the  relationships  between
              RL and existing work  in  fields  such  as  operations   research;   (3) 
              Identifying  potential   industrial  applications of RL research.  A 10-15 page
              report on the findings  of  the  workshop will be produced, along with a
              summary suitable  for   WWW   posting.   It  is  intended  also  to   discuss  
              the  establishment   of   an   electronic  newsgroup   to   facilitate 
              communication among disparate groups working in RL-related areas.
