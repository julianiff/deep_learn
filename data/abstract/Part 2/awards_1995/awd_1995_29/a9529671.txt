Abstract    :
              9529671  CONTE    This research will use specific molecular marker compounds 
              (biomarkers) derived from terrestrial plants (e.g.>C22 n-alkanes,n-  alkanols,
              and n-alkanoic acids, terpenes and their derivatives) to  "fingerprint"
              biogenic carbon from different continental source  regions and to assess the
              magnitude and variation in aeolian inputs  and deep ocean fluxes or
              terrestrially-derived biomarkers in the  atmosphere, rainfall and surface
              waters near Bermuda and the  "molecular signature" of the main continental
              source regions (2) to  investigate the meteorological and climatic controls on
              the  magnitude and variability of aeolian fluxes from these source  regions,
              (3) to determine the time-varying pattern of deep ocean  fluxes of terrestrial
              biomarkers and to investigate the upper ocean  processes that link aeolian
              deposition and deep ocean  sedimentation, and (4) to determine the interannual
              variations in  deep ocean sedimentation patterns for recent years of climatic 
              extremes (e.g. ENSO, subSaharan drought events), to quantitatively  assess how
              terrestrial biomarker sedimentation patterns vary with  changes in the North
              Atlantic climate system.
