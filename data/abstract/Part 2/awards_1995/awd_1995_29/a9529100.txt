Abstract    :
              To address questions of zooplankton dispersal in the ocean, especially
              identification of sources of Calanus finmarchicus for recruitment to Georges
              Bank, we are using an integrated analysis of the population genetic character
              of the copepod  and the hydrographic parameters of  water mass and transport
              patterns in the western N. Atlantic.  Our goal is to document, using biological
              and physical evidence, the sources and transport patterns that influence the
              annual increase of copepods on Georges Bank.  For the population genetics
              effort, we are determining levels of genetic variation, evidence for
              sub-division into genetically distinct populations, and quantitative estimates
              of gene flow and dispersal across the sampling  domain.  For the hydrographic
              effort, we are using historical observations to provide a climatological 
              perspective of water mass structure and variability.  The primary archives are
              the Atlantic Fisheries  Adjustment Program (AFAP) hydrographic database.  We
              will also have access to the new NMFS data (not in NODC) for comparison with
              the climatological analyses we are  producing.
