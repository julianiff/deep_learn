Abstract    :
              9529632  Niiler    Mean fields, seasonal cycles, eddy variances will be 
              computed from over ten years  of satellite-tracked drifter tracks for the
              Pacific Ocean.  These Lagrangian drifters  were deployed as part of the
              WOCE/TOGA Surface Velocity  Program. Of special  interest are the general
              circulation and variability of the  subtropical gyres, the  western boundary
              current and the relationship of time  variable surface circulation to  time
              variable winds. Comparisons of the drifter data with  ocean circulation model 
              output, the high density XBT sections and satellite  altimetry will be
              conducted.
