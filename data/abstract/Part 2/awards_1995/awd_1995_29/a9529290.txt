Abstract    :
              9529290  Presnall         This grant provides $60,000 as two years partial 
              salary support for a electron microprobe  laboratory technician at the
              University of Texas -  Dallas.  This Phase II technician support grant  follows
              a successfully completed three year Phase  I technician support grant
              (EAR-9205608).  The University has pledged 80% salary support for  this
              position after expiration of this award and  will provide, for up to two years,
              the additional  20% in the event that research grant funds are not  sufficient.
               The technician will be responsible  for the maintenance and operation of the
              electron  microprobe and will assist with the training of  graduate and
              undergraduate students and provide  analytical service to outside users of the 
              facility.  Further technical assistance at this  laboratory will allow the PI
              to continue research  in experimental petrology and geochemistry of  basalts
              for which the electron microprobe is the  centerpiece of this lab's analytical
              tools.  ***
