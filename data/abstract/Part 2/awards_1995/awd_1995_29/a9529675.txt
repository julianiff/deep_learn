Abstract    :
              This research is on developing structured design methods for Micro-Electrical- 
              Mechanical Systems (MEMS).  The focus is on MEMS fabrication process simulation
               and mask-layout synthesis.  In analogy to present-day VLSI design, tools to 
              permit rapid, accurate, conservative mask layout synthesis of MEMS are being 
              explored.  The objective for the tools is to enable a MEMS designer to specify 
              a desire micro-mechanical function (e.g., a mechanical spring with particular 
              characteristics), and have a system automatically generate the information
              (mask-  layout, and other fabrication instructions) to create the shape that
              exhibits the  desired function.  This would includes refining and extending the
              3-D anisotropic  etch simulation methods.  Prototype software design tools are
              being developed.
