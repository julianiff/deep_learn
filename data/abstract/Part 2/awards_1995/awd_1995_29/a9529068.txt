Abstract    :
                 This award supported travel expenses for student participants  in  CONCUR '95
              -- the Sixth International Conference on Concurrency  Theory,  held August
              21-24, 1995, in Philadelphia on the campus of  the University of  Pennsylvania.
               The purpose of CONCUR '95 was to  bring together researchers,  developers, and
              students from  academia, industry, and government so that the  science of 
              concurrency theories and the technology of their applications can  be advanced.
               The conference spans all areas of semantics,  models, logics, and 
              verification techniques for concurrent  systems.  Particular topics include,
              but  are not limited to,  process algebras, Petri nets, true concurrency, 
              shared-memory and  message-passing formalisms, operational and denotational 
              semantics, programming language semantics, concurrent logic and  constraint 
              programming, fairness, temporal logics, compositional  analysis techniques, 
              model checking, verification tools, and  applications.    The primary goal of 
              holding CONCUR '95 in the U.S. was to  increase participation by American 
              researchers in the area, and  to encourage interaction among the various 
              schools, both European  and American, that have worked towards formal
              approaches  to  concurrency.
