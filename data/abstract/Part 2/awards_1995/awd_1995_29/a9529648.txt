Abstract    :
              9529648    Gordon    In this project, the PI will carry out phase 2 of ARLINDO
              (Indonesian acronym for Indonesian   Throughflow), called ARLINDO Circulation
              (AC).  The objective is to study the circulation and   water mass
              stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a thorough
              description   of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and
              dominant mixing processes.  AC is   specifically aimed at resolving the
              throughflow transport and velocity field across the central   passages of the
              Indonesian Seas, and extending hydrography to the eastern Banda Sea.  Moorings 
               are designed to measure the mean and variable current and thermohaline 
              stratification. The lead   PI in this award will provide overall guidance for
              the entire project, and carry out water mass   analysis from the CTD
              hydrography.  The Co-PI will oversee the deployment, recovery, and   analysis
              of data from temperature pods, particularly to determine the role and
              importance of   internal waves in both mixing and transport of the throughflow
              water.
