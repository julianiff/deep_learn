Abstract    :
              9529805  Pu  Organic materials with second-order nonlinear optical  properties
              are potentially very useful in optical  information storage and processing, and
              in  telecommunication.  Three dimensional organic polymeric  materials with
              similar NLO chromophore geometry are unknown.  Organic polymers have better
              mechanical flexibility and  processability than inorganic salts.  We therefore
              propose  to use  optically active binaphthyls to build propeller  polymers. 
              These propeller polymers are expected to exhibit  second-order NLO properties. 
              The NLO properties of the  propeller polymers can be adjusted and optimized by 
              systematically modifying the conjugation length, the  electron donors and
              acceptors of the repeat unit.  Macroscopic organization of the propeller
              polymers will also  be conducted by using ionic self-assembly technique.  %%% 
              This study will not only lead to potentially useful  materials, but will also
              provide us the fundamental  knowledge of these structurally fascinating new
              polymers.  Potential implications are in the broad areas of electrical  and
              electronic materials, thin-film devices, optical  waveguides and similar active
              components.  ***
