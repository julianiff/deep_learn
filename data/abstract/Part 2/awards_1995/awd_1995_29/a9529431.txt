Abstract    :
              9529431  Wessel    The Generic Mapping Tool is a software package used by
              several  thousand scientists in the US and aboard which allows them to 
              communicate their results in a compact manner via GMT scripts and  manipulate
              their data and produce graphics. The PI will continue to  maintain and support
              the package, implementing several new  features, including graphic user
              interface, adherence to Adobe PS  convention and time series support. It will
              also be interfaced with  World Wide Web for greater accessibility by the
              community.
