Abstract    :
              9529557  Bourne  This proposal seeks funds to help support an International
              Summer School on Macromolecular Crystallographic Computing which is organized
              under the auspices on the International Union of Crystallography.  This will be
              the fourteenth such meeting and will be held at Western Washington University
              from August 16-22, 1996.  Macromolecular crystallography is concerned with the
              accurate determination of the 3-dimensional structure of biological
              macromolecules.  This is important for a better understanding of biological
              function at the molecular level, which in turn leads to advances in medicine
              through a better understanding of the cause of disease and the design of new
              drugs to combat medical problems.  The School will be limited to 150 scientists
              and students who will receive lectures and hands-on teaching in the
              computational aspects of macromolecular crystallography.  This School is
              considered especially timely since computing and communication technology in
              general, and computing techniques in macromolecular structure solution and
              interpretation in particular, are advancing at a rapid rate.  A total of $5,000
              is sought  towards supporting the School.  The overall cost of the School is
              estimated at $93,000  ***
