Abstract    :
                CDA-9529459    Michael W. Berry  Jens Gregor  Mark T. Jones  James S. Plank 
              Padma Raghavan    University of Tennessee    An ATM networked 12
              high-performance workstations supports several research projects in  the
              Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee, including in
              particular:  Scientific Applications in a Distributed Computing Environment,
              PET Image Reconstruction in a Distributed Environment, Parallel Algorithms and
              Software for Unstructured Mesh Computations, Fast Checkpointing in Parallel
              Environments, and Parallel Sparse Matrix Computations.    This computing
              laboratory provides required resources of CPU time, local memory, communication
              bandwidth and disk storage for the computationally intensive projects.  Some of
              the research tasks require this dedicated laboratory for their exceptionally
              long runtimes.  The systems project requires access to such an environment to
              run meaningful experiments.  In addition, the dedicated laboratory facilities
              may be reconfigured or subjected to simulated faults without concern about the
              effects on other users.  The research projects will produce public-domain
              software.  Because several government and industrial sites will soon have
              facilities similar to that which we propose, regular access to such a
              laboratory is essential for quality software research and development.
