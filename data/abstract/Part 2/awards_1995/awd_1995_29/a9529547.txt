Abstract    :
              9529547  Peacock  On  July  31, 1995, Tropical Storm Erin was upgraded to
              hurricane  status  and  appeared  to be headed directly  for  the  southeast 
              Florida   coast,  prompting  officials  to  urge  almost  400,000  residents to
              evacuate coastal areas and mobile home parks.   This  award  is  made  under
              the Small Grants for Exploratory  Research  Program  and  will  enable the
              researchers to collect  perishable  data  in  an  investigation  of both 
              mitigation  and  evacuation  actions taken by households in response to the
              storm.  While  the  research will focus on mitigation and evacuation decisions
              in the  face of the hurricane risk, models developed will be extended  to 
              earthquakes and other hazard situations, especially in regards to  housing and
              insurance.  ***
