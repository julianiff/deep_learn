              9520723  Seyfried    Title: Halogen (C1, F) exchange and C1 isotope
              fractionation during  fluid-mineral equilibra: experimental calibration of a
              new tool to  study subseafloor hydrothermal systems    Seawater circulates
              through the ocean crust and interacts with  minerals there and leaves chlorine
              (C1 and flourine (f) behind.  This is known from minerals that have been
              recovered from the ocean  floor. The amount of C1 and F that is taken up by
              minerals is  probably related to the conditions within the sea floor, yet the 
              relationship between these conditions, such as temperature, and the  abundance
              of C1 and F in the fluid, and the amount of C1 and F  deposited in the minerals
              is not known. The investigators plan to  use laboratory experiments to
              determine how temperature and other  conditions control C1 and F in minerals.
              This can then be used to  interpret the conditions of the formation of the
              ocean crust.
