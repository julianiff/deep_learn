Abstract    :
              9529769  Puro  The research will identify characteristics of persons selected to
              serve as labor arbitrators.  It will pay special attention to possible
              distinctions attributable to gender.  It will analyze a previously unused
              Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service data base consisting of sever years
              of federal arbitrator selection information.  Multiple regression and time
              series analyses will be used to develop a profile of arbitrator biographical
              characteristics.  Regional differences and preferences will also be explored.
