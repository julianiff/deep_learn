Abstract    :
                  This investigation aims to develop a time-dependent theory of 
              magnetospheric substorms, with correct time scales for the growth  phase, the
              pre-onset interval and the expansion phase.  The study  will use an analytical
              model and a two-dimensional, low-  dissipation, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model
              developed under a  previous award.  The model includes the geometrical and
              dynamical  features of current sheets in the early growth phase and the pre- 
              onset interval, and clarifies the role of forced reconnection.  The 
              investigation involves the study of the role of collisionless  effects, the
              role of ideal ballooning/kink instabilities in the  magnetotail, and the role
              of ionospheric boundary conditions.   Emphasis will be on obtaining the correct
              time-history and spatial  signatures found by observations in the growth and
              expansion phases  of substorms.
