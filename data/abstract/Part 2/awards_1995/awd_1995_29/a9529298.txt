Abstract    :
              The Recursive Auto Associative Memory (RAAM) architecture  for compositional
              neural encoding has been the basis for numerous studies and prototype models
              for neural network algorithms applied to linguistic and symbolic reasoning
              tasks. However, to date, the scale and understanding of the representational
              model has been very limited. This is due to several logical conundrums inherent
              in the original model, related to the separation of terminal from non-terminal
              patterns. A deeper understanding of the logical structure of recursive
              encoding,  and a  new mathematical understanding of the fractal limit dynamics
              of recurrent networks, results in a novel and powerful revision of the RAAM
              architecture which resolve the logical problems and allows for potentially
              infinite structures to be cleanly and precisely represented by
              fixed-dimensional neural activity patterns. In this grant we will be exploring,
              refining, and exploiting this new architecture and building larger-scale
              models, using both serial and massively parallel implementations, which will
              increase the applicability of neural  network learning systems to areas with 
              stronger data structure requirements. Scientifically, this work builds strong
              connections between traditional cognitive science capacities, nonlinear
              dynamics, and neurally plausible computational models.
