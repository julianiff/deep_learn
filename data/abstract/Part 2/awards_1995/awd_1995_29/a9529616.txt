Abstract    :
              9529616  Farmer  This proposal describes research and the need for specialized
              equipment in the area of bonding ultra-thin silicon wafers (as thin as 2
              micrometers) to virgin and oxidized silicon substrates.  The integrity of the
              bonded interface is of paramount importance in understanding the fundamental
              issues of reliability and failure mechanisms.  The quality of the interface
              will be examined with an IR microscope to determine the effects of  annealing
              temperature and surface roughness.  The fields of application for this
              technology include Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), Silicon on
              Insulator (SOI) and Silicon (SOS).  ***
