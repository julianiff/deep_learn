Abstract    :
                 This award supports the dissertation research of a student of social forestry
              at Yale university.  The project is to interview smallholder farmers in the
              Amazon estuary of Brazil on their interactions with the estuarine floodplain
              over the past 30 years and explain how these interventions have been involved
              with resource conflict and property relations.  The student will seek to
              explain how human management of streams has transformed the local landscape,
              how changing labor and property relations and conflicts over resources shaped
              and were influenced by changes in the physical landscape, and how local people
              understand their ability to act autonomously in economic and ecological issues.
                The methods will include a survey and intensive interviews with about 100
              households, the population of the local study area, about productive relations
              over time and resource conflicts.  Aerial photographs will be used as an
              interview aid.  A geographic information system database will be developed to
              analyze trends over time; the distribution of different crops and
              economically-exploited forest products will be analyzed and related to local
              events and conflicts.    This research is important because it adds to our
              expertise about the economic behavior of farmers in this area of the world, and
              will provide valuable information about local people's feelings and
              understandings of environmental issues.  If the deforestation of the Amazon is
              to be controlled in the future, policies must be based on understanding of what
              local people do in environmental interactions, and why they do it, information
              which will be produced by this sort of study.   + - +- ±- f8 Û-ª  þ
