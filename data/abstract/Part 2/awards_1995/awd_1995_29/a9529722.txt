Abstract    :
              9529722  Hunter    Gold and silver mines are often located in pristine
              environments that are highly susceptible to pollution by mining and metals
              recovery activities.  While biotechnologies have been developed for freeing
              precious metals from refractory ores, cyanidation is still the process of
              choice for extracting gold and silver values.  This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase II project will continue the development of a novel
              biohydrometallurgical process for extracting gold and silver from bio-oxidized
              ore.  The project investigates the use of a bisulfide leaching solution as an
              effective, but more environmentally friendly and less costly, alternative to
              the conventional cyanidation process.  However, in recent years, the addition
              of the environmental costs to the total cost of mining gold and silver has
              stimulated a search for options that are more environmentally acceptable.  The
              proposed bisulfide leaching approach takes advantage of the fact that
              sulfate-reducing bacteria are capable of both (1) producing dissolved sulfides
              which act as a complexing agent for precious metals and (2) consuming hydrogen
              gas generated by the complexation (anaerobic corrosion) reaction.  During Phase
              II, a laboratory prototype will be designed, constructed, and operated; its
              performance will then be compared to that of the conventional cyanidation
              process.  The prototype will include subsystems for bio-oxidation, gold
              extraction, and gold recovery.  A change in the basic technology of gold and
              silver extraction is proposed that will reduce mining-related pollution at its
              source.   The proposed process can be applied in leaching precious metals
              (gold, silver and platinum group metals) from their ores and from metal scrap,
              which is a multibillion market worldwide.  If Phase I results are borne out,
              bisulfide leaching could reduce chemical reagent costs.  The proposed
              biohydrometallurgical process could provide a means of gold and silver recovery
              that is both profitable and relatively nonpolluting.
