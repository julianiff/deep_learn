              Pennsylvania State University    Robust Purposive Vision Lab    A Robust
              Purposive Vision Laboratory using high performance image processing and imaging
              equipment is established within the Electrical Engineering and the Computer
              Science and Engineering Departments at the Pennsylvania State University.  This
              laboratory supports research towards the development of both theoretical tools
              and specific algorithms for robust vision systems.  Despite their potential to
              reduce costs and increase flexibility and safety, vision systems are not common
              in industrial environments.  This can be traced to the inability of many
              algorithms to handle uncertainty.  The main contribution of our on-- going and
              proposed research is to develop robust purposive vision methods, by combining
              functional and physics based computer vision with newly developed
              multiobjective robust control and filtering techniques.  We expect that this
              combination will result in robust systems that can be successfully moved from a
              controlled university environment into the "real world".  In particular, these
              results will be applied to reverse engineering, target tracking and motion
              detection.
