Abstract    :
              9529749  Nelson                                   The chemistry of calcium and
              the carbon dioxide-carbonate  system of the world ocean are intimately related
              by processes of  production and dissolution of calcium carbonate. The calcium 
              carbonate- carbon dioxide system is in fact one of the major  geochemical
              features of the marine environment. Recent data  strongly suggest that
              variations in calcium concentrations in the  ocean are not quite equal to those
              one would expect based on the  corresponding variations in alkalinity. This
              means that there is  something about this major marine geochemical system that
              we do not  understand.         In this project, scientists at the University of
              Washington  will carry out a detailed study of calcium and alkalinity 
              variations in the oceanic water column with two ends in mind.   First they will
              characterize the calcium-alkalinity discrepancy  on  a global basis by
              surveying waters of the Northwest Pacific,  Northeast Pacific, Southeast
              Pacific, and the North Indian Ocean.  Secondly, they will also make
              high-precision measurements of  magnesium and lithium concentrations and
              lithium isotope  distributions on a global scale to test the hypothesis that
              the Ca-  alkalinity discrepancy can be explained by hydrothermal input of 
              ocean ridges.
