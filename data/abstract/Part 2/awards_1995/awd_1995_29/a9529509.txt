Abstract    :
              CDA-9529509      Taylor, Russell H.   Wolff, Lawrence B.      The Johns Hopkins
              University   Baltimore, Maryland      Instrumentation for Computer Science and
              Engineering Research in Image Segmentation, Registration,   Modeling, and 
              Interactive Model-based Task Optimization      A computation server and
              visualization workstation are provided for a new laboratory in Computer Science
                Department at The Johns Hopkins University for interdisciplinary research in
              robotics, image-processing,   computer vision, modeling, and
              computer-integrated surgery.  Specific research projects include: (a)  
              segmentation, modeling, and characterization of complex tubular structures such
              as blood vessels and   bronchial trees from 3D tomographic images; (b) accurate
              vision-based camera-to-model registration and   navigation within modeled 3D
              structures; and (c) development of methods for combining numerical  
              optimization, geometric modeling, path planning and uncertainty analysis, and
              interactive visualizations to   help a human expert plan a complex 3D task for
              robotically-assisted execution.  This research combines   numerically intensive
              computation on 2D and 3D images and models with interactive visualization of  
              models and intermediate computational results, using examples from biomedical
              modeling, using problems   in biomedical imaging, endoscopy, and radiation
              therapy planning to provide motivation and focus.  The   provided equipment
              significantly promotes this research by permitting realistic experimental
              evaluation on   full-scale image data sets and models of novel algorithms and
              methods in computer vision, modeling,   computational steering, and
              human-machine partnerships.
