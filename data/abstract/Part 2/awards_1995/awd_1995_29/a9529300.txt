Abstract    :
                   The prehistoric human inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia were faced
              with markedly  different environmental circumstances than people living there
              today.  At the time of the Last  Glacial Maximum (18,000 years ago) lower sea
              levels and cooler conditions affected the  prehistoric landscape exposing the
              subcontinent of Sundaland and reducing the extent of rain  forest in favor of
              more seasonal flora and fauna.  How these circumstances affected prehistoric 
              human diet is the subject of this research.   This paleodietary study will
              examine stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and dental pathology  and wear data
              derived from terminal Pleistocene and Holocene skeletal materials.  Results
              will  be interpreted within the context of changes in subsistence and
              settlement in the region.  Distinctions between foraging groups depending on
              marine food resources will be made against  those subsisting more on
              terrestrial foods.  Changes in diet associated with the transition to 
              agriculture will be examined as will the issue of rain forest habitation prior
              to this transition.
