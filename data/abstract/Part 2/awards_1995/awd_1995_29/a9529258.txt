Abstract    :
              9529258  Lasaga    This grant provides $154,875 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring a new in-situ near- atomic  resolution hydrothermal system and
              automated BET  equipment for analysis of mineral surfaces in  studies of
              dissolution and precipitation kinetics.  The hydrothermal system will be custom
              built and  used specifically for micro-scale analyses of  dissolution and
              precipitation rates at crystal  surfaces while the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
               instrument will be purchased "off-the-shelf" and  used for determination of
              reactive surface area of  mineral powders.   Determination of the reaction 
              kinetics of silicate minerals is central to low  temperature geochemical
              research and is essential  to an understanding of environmental geochemical 
              processes.  ***
