Abstract    :
              In response to the need of scientists and educators for assistance in developing
              courses and programs to teach responsible scientific conduct, the National
              Research Council will convene a meeting of approximately 30 scientific conduct
              instructors and curriculum developers, ethicists, researchers, and
              administrators, across the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, medicine,
              social sciences, and engineering.  The meeting will be a strategy session to
              consider what kinds of information educators need as they design their programs
              on scientific conduct, and how that information can best be put together in a
              way that provides them with meaningful guidance. To achieve that objective, the
              workshop participants will identify the needs of prospective educators involved
              in programs and courses on scientific conduct, and the kinds of information
              that will be most useful to them as they design their programs; examine a range
              of materials (courses, methods, textbooks) being used currently to teach
              scientific conduct, and discuss strategies for evaluating them; compile a list
              of candidate elements that might be included in a guide to assist educators in
              developing their programs, and discuss strategies for relating these to an
              instructor's choice of curricular materials or approaches; discuss options for
              designing an effective guide for educators.  Participants will consider how
              such a tool can be designed to have the most impact.
