Abstract    :
              The efficient use of bandwidth for multimedia information transmission depends 
              on the efficient use of imperfect channels, such as coaxial cables and optical 
              fibers.  This means redundant information must be removed and what remains must
               be coded for reliable transmission.  This research is addressing the problems
              of  redundancy removal (source coding) from the point of view of multichannel 
              filterbanks; it is also addressing the problem of efficiently implementing 
              filterbanks in digital electronics.    Specifically, we are studying
              applications of undersampling operators,  oversampling operators, and tight
              frames to source coding, channel coding and  halftoning.  The aim of this
              research is to develop efficient state variable  realizations for tight frames
              and related maps, and to determine the  computational complexity and
              performance characteristics of these realizations.   Of particular interest are
              sum of all-pass realizations for multichannel  filterbanks.  The results will
              produce insights and design rules for implementing  source coders and channel
              coders in state variable filterbanks that have good  numerical properties.
