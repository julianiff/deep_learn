Abstract    :
              This research project, carried out by Professor Phillipe  Guyot-Sionnest and his
              research group at the University of Chicago,  addresses questions of
              vibrational energy flow between adsorbed  molecules and metal surfaces. 
              Supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program, this project
              examines the transfer of  vibrational energy between adsorbed diatomic
              molecules and the  metal surface, as well as the effect of vibrational
              excitation on  the dynamics of small molecule reactions at these surfaces.  The
               development of fast infrared laser sources needed for these studies  forms
              another focus of this research effort.  The basic information  obtained from
              these studies is useful for our developing  understanding of important
              heterogeneous processes such as  catalysis and semiconductor device processing.
                The detailed understanding of the dynamics of energy exchange and  reaction
              at solid surfaces is the goal of this research project.   Fast infrared laser
              probing of these processes is used to obtain a  detailed picture of energy
              transfer and reaction at metal surfaces.   This basic information impacts
              technologically important areas such  as heterogeneous catalysis and electronic
              materials processing.
