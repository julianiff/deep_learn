Abstract    :
                Abstract  9529359  D.T. Shaw, SUNY at Buffalo    It is proposed to extend the
              application of  the Photo Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) technique to in-situ
              measurement of finer chain-like aggregation aerosols and to determine its
              operating conditions.  Another objective is to obtain information on the time
              evolution of ultrafine particle and chain aggregate growth after establishing
              the limitations of the experimental technique.  The results will be calibrated
              using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on aerosol samples to determine
              both particle/chain size and shape distributions.  A stable and reproducible
              chain aggregate iron oxide aerosol generator will be used.  The PCS laser beam
              will be focused to a small beam width of about 100 microns, and its position
              will be varied at different distances from the aerosol source in order to
              monitor the evolution of  particle aggregate size.    The work has special
              relevance to on-line measurements and control in industry, in laboratory
              experiments, as well as for testing theoretical models for particle grow.
