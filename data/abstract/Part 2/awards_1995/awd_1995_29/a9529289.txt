Abstract    :
              9529289  Hsueh    In this project, the PI will construct an eddy-resolving 
              General Circulation Model of the marginal seas of northern  China to study the
              dynamics of mesoscale flow features  caused by topographic effects on the
              Kuroshio  -- an effect  common to all western boundary currents.  Data from a 
              Taiwanese study, KEEP-ll (Kuroshio Edge Exchange Processes-  ll), of the
              continental margin area northeast of Taiwan will  be incorporated into the
              model.  The PI will collaborate  with Taiwanese scientists by participating in
              these surveys  in an advisory capacity, which will ensure the availability  of
              the data.
