Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Dudley Herschbach of Harvard University will continue   his
              studies using molecular beam techniques to examine the effect on   reactive
              collisional and spectroscopic processes of the alignment of   molecules in
              static electric or magnetic fields.  The current project   proposes to develop
              a more general method of spatially trapping molecules   than investigated
              previously which uses an intense laser field to confine   suitable molecules
              for times on the order of hours.  In addition to   constructing the trapping
              apparatus, the PI will use directional   molecules to study phenomena such as
              rotationally inelastic collisions of   oriented molecules, vector correlations
              in atom-diatom reactions, and the   shift of chemical equilibrium induced by
              molecular alignment in a strong   magnetic field.  Normally, when molecules
              react chemically, the mutual orientation of the   colliding partners is
              completely random.  Prof. Herschbach is developing   a general method for
              orienting the molecules prior to reaction in order   to see if there is an
              effect on the outcome.  Using this technique,   chemical reaction mechanisms
              can be elucidated at an unprecedented level   of detail.   The use of oriented
              molecular targets in molecular beam   studies of chemical reactions will lead
              to much more accurate and   detailed pictures of gas phase reaction mechanisms.
