Abstract    :
              This collaborative project will develop the infrastructure necessary to collect
              a large scale data base detailing the behavior of state supreme courts across
              states and over time.  The data will combine state supreme court judge votes,
              case outcomes, and case characteristics with judge attributes, institutional
              attributes and selected contextual variables.  By combining data from multiple
              contexts, years, and levels of analysis, this survey of state high courts will
              support research of theoretical importance across a range of analytic
              approaches and substantive interests.  These data will permit systematic
              evaluation of theories that connect the law and judges with their
              institutional, political and social contexts.  This award funds the preliminary
              testing of the feasibility of various data collection strategies, creates a
              national Board of Overseers, and facilitates planning of the larger study
              including estimating the possibilities for integration of this data collection
              with other comprehensive federal court/case data sets supported by the Law and
              Social Sciences program. ***
