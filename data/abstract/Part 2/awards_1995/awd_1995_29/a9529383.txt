Abstract    :
              9529383  Shoureshi  The "NSF/NIST/EPRI workshop on New Directions in Intelligent
               Systems" to be held at the NIST facilities located in  Gaithersburg, MD, from
              June 10 to June 12, 1996 brings  together leading industrial representatives,
              scientists and  engineers who have made pioneering contributions in the 
              general areas of dynamic system analysis, measurement, and  control of smart
              engineering systems. In particular, the  industrial leaders focus their
              discussions and presentations  on identifying the future needs in the areas of
              intelligent  systems, including their architecture and their components  such
              as computers, controls, sensors and actuators. The  researchers from the
              academe and the national laboratories  analyze the needs of the industry and
              define research  directions which would enable the industry to meet the 
              challenges of the 21st century. The support for the workshop  is provided by
              the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), the Electric Power
              Research Institute  (EPRI) in addition to the National Science Foundation 
              (NSF).***
