Abstract    :
              AST-9529328  Martin Weinberg    Excitation and Evolution of Structure in
              Galactic Halos and  Disks.    Dr. Weinberg will study the dynamics of galaxies
              with active  halos.  More specifically he will examine the nature and 
              excitation of long-lived perturbation modes in halos, the  influence of an
              excited halo on an embedded disk, and long-lived  modes in disks and their
              effects on parent halos.  The research  will use a closely coupled combination
              of perturbation theory and  N-body methods.  The PI plans to make his numerical
              codes  available to the community at theend of the project.
