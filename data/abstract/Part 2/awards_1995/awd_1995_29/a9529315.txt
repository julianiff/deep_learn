Abstract    :
              Abstract/Garstang           The objective of this research is the propagation of
               infrasound in a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer in  East Africa
              (Namibia).  Observations of relevant meteorological  variables, made during a
              recent field experiment, will be used to  investigate how elephants and other
              mammals exploit an apparent  wave guide in the boundary layer to communicate
              over relatively  large distances (40Km).
