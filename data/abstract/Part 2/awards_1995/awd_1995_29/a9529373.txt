Abstract    :
              This award is for a series of discussions at academic institutions  and a
              national meeting in Washington to illuminate the major  sources of stress
              affecting the academic research and education  community in the sciences and
              engineering, and to provoke debate on  constructive approaches to change.  This
              project builds on the  experience a similar project carried out in 1993-1994 by
              expanding  the initial campus-based dialogues to a wider array of institutions 
              and addressing some new issues.  This second phase of the study has  three
              objectives: to catalyze discussion and change on campuses; to  encourage
              national dialogue among all parties with interests in the  academic enterprise;
              and, to revive or recast the compact between  the federal government and
              universities.  As in the previous study,  a report will be issued and widely
              disseminated to colleges and  universities and other stakeholders jointly by
              the National Science  Board and the Government-University-Industry Research
              Roundtable.   This report will serve as a record of the insights and proposals
              of  the project participants, and it will enumerate activities or "best 
              practices" that have proven to be useful in resolving outstanding  concerns.
