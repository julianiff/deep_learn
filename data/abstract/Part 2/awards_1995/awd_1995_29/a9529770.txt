Abstract    :
              In this work, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   in the
              Chemistry Division, Robin L. McCarley of Louisiana State   University, Baton
              Rouge, will study ways to modify self-assembled   monolayers (SAMs) on an in
              place basis.  A major thrust of the project is   to use electrochemical
              polymerization to manipulate reactions in SAMs to   produce surfaces with
              specific properties.  The chemistry uses conducting   thin film poly(pyrrole)
              polymers produced from substituted alkyl thiols   attached to gold surfaces.  A
              number of instrumental methods will be used   to study the films that are
              produced.  One, attenuated total internal   reflection Fourier transform
              infrared spectroscopy, is particularly   useful because it produces information
              about the chemical composition of   the surface of the material.  Scanning
              tunneling microscopy and scanning   force microscopy are to be used to provide
              information about surface   topography and structure.  The objective is to
              correlate macroscopic   properties of the thin film materials with molecular
              structure.   This investigation will study ways to control the chemistry
              involved in   the formation of organic thin films constructed on gold surfaces
              which   serve as a physical support for the film.  The purpose is to produce
              film   materials with physical and chemical characteristics tailored to a  
              specific application.  In the long term, this will enable construction of  
              sensors for environmental monitoring and other purposes which have high  
              molecular specificity.
