Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
              of the  Chemistry Division, develops new methods for the preparation of thin
              film heterostructures.   Layer-by-layer growth of inorganic thin films
              exhibiting covalent and non-covalent interactions  between layers are prepared
              and characterized.  Interlayer molecular recognition and template  based
              synthesis of two dimensional structures is carried out in this work.  The
              rational design  of sensor materials using these approaches is a focus of this
              research.  These materials show  promising technological applications as small
              molecule sensors and optoelectronic materials.  The rational design and
              synthesis of thin layer inorganic materials which exhibit particular 
              properties is the goal of this research project.  Using methods based on
              molecular recognition  and an understanding of interlayer interactions, thin
              layer materials are designed and constructed,  their structure and properties
              determined, and their technological application evaluated.  Novel  sensors, and
              electronic and optical materials will result from the work of this research
              program.
