Abstract    :
              This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program includes a broad survey of transition metal complexes with two  
              multidentate ligand systems, tropocoronands and binucleating   dicarboxylates,
              with the primary goal of learning how the properties of a   metal ion can be
              tuned by the local ligand environment.  Studies of Co,   Rh, Fe, Mn, V, Ti, and
              Zr complexes of the tropocoronands will be   performed in which variation in
              chain length and stereochemistry at the   metal center is expected to affect
              the physical properties and reactivity   at the metal center. The dicarboxylate
              ligands will be studied with   labile metal pairs, and the phosphate-ester
              hydrolysis reactions of   Zn(II), Mn(II), and Mg(II) will be examined.  Among
              other things,   dinuclear early transition metal organometallic complexes will
              be   examined for their C-C bond-forming reactions, and multielectron transfer 
               reactions in systems with redox-active porphyrin rings will be studied.  In
              this work the fundamental factors controlling structure and reactivity   of
              metal centers bound to nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms will be   explored. 
              These atoms are constrained by carbon atom frameworks to   orientations which
              enhance the reactivity at the metal center.  These   fundamental studies have
              relevance to areas of bioinorganic chemistry,   catalysis, and materials
              science.
