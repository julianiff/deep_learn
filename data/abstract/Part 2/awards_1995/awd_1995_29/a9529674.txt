Abstract    :
              Rob Coalson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of   quantum dynamics
              with application to condensed phase and macroscopic   systems.  Coalson will
              employ computational many-body quantum dynamics   approaches to studies in two
              areas of research: 1) quantum dynamics in   condensed phases with emphasis on
              vibronic lineshapes and electron   transfer rates; and  2) electrostatic
              interactions between macroions in   electrolytic solution as relevant to
              charged colloid systems.  This   research seeks to achieve fundamental insights
              into such phenomena as   optical absorption of chromophores in condensed phase,
              the role of   nonequilibrium initial state preparation in electron transfer
              dynamics,   and electrostatic interactions of macroion / electrolyte systems at
              high   concentration and density.  At the same time, technologically important 
               applications such as the use of laser fields to control condensed phase  
              electron transfer rates will be explored.  Coalson's research will lead to a
              molecular level understanding of the   fundamental interactions of laser
              radiation with condensed phase systems.    This understanding could have
              important long range implications in the   area of materials synthesis and
              processing.
