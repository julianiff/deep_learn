Abstract    :
                   Receptor organs for detecting gravity are called otocysts in invertebrates,
              and otolithic organs in vertebrates.  They are pouches that contain dense
              masses of calcified crystals called otoconia; the action of gravity on these
              masses, overlying specialized mechanosensory cells, provides a signal for
              determining  the normal earth-vertical direction.  The otoconia have remarkably
              specific mineral chemistry and crystalline structure in different animals, and
              pilot studies suggest that these features may vary somewhat under different
              gravitational conditions.  The flight of Neurolab provides a unique opportunity
              to examine the development of these gravitational sensing accessories in the
              absence of normal gravity.  Ground-based studies using electron microscopy and
              atomic-force microscopy provide data on the sizes, weights, and mineral
              composition of the otoconia during normal development.  Results will be
              important for understanding development of the vestibular system, for
              considering calcium homeostasis in general, and may have some impact on
              biomaterials studies.  Contribution to this project represents the NSF
              Biological Sciences Directorate's participation in the NASA/Interagency
              Neurolab activity on the space shuttle orbiter, which in turn is part of Decade
              of the Brain activities.
