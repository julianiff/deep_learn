Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the ways in
              which industries differ in the use and effectiveness of quality practices. 
              Previous studies have tended to overlook industry differences in the use and
              effectiveness of quality-related work and production practices, focusing
              instead on overall trends across industries or on single industry case studies.
               The study will provide the first empirical analysis of the ways the
              transformation to quality practice differs across U.S. manufacturing
              industries.  To examine this issue, the study will use survey data from a 1994
              study of the entire population of Japanese affiliated manufacturing plants in
              the United States, and a 1992 sample of a size-stratified sample of U.S.
              manufacturing establishments generally.  These samples contain detailed
              information on the production and work organization, quality practices, labor
              force, customer-supplier relations and performance of plants in a wide variety
              of manufacturing industries.  Analysis of survey data will permit
              identification of technological and organizational factors that are associated
              with industry differences in the adoption and implementation of a range of
              quality practices.  The study also will include an analysis of the performance
              impacts of quality practices by industry.  f8  +   _
