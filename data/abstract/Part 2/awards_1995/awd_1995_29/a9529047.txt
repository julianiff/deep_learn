Abstract    :
              9529047  Zeikus  This project is on research to study aspects of biocatalysis
              and  thermostability for extremely thermophlic xylose (glucose)  isomerases
              (GIs).  The research will focus on GIs from the  thermophilic and the
              hyperthermophilic eubacterial genera  Thermoanaerobacterium and Thermotoga, and
              will attempt to  identify the structural bases for thermal stability and
              differing  catalytic activities for this family of enzymes.  In addition, 
              these enzymes will be model systems for studying substrate  binding and the
              role of metal ions in the enzymes structure and  function.  The sequences and
              crystal structures of these enzymes  will be compared to the less thermostable
              GIs.  ***
