Abstract    :
              AST  95-29274  PI:  Gerard Luppino         Wide Field Observations of Weak
              Gravitational Lensing Using  the UH 8192 x 8192 CCD Mosaic Camera         The
              proposed observational funding is aimed at mapping dark  matter on cluster and
              larger scales using weak gravitational  lensing. The program will exploit
              unique access to an instrument  built specifically for lensing studies: the new
              UH 8192x8192 CCD  mosaic camera.. The mosaic is a close-packed 4x2 array of
              CCDs  with 15 um pixels providing a 0.47 deg wide field of view. The 
              observations will concentrate on two areas. The first is to  obtain wide field
              images of clusters of galaxies spanning  redshifts between 0.1 and 1, thus
              probing cluster dark matter  profiles at large radii. For two clusters with
              giant arcs, for  which an existing HST image is available, the mass profile 
              reconstruction will be extended into the core, providing evidence  to help
              distinguish between various dark matter models. The  second observational
              program is a deep survey in two colors, V  and I, covering a 10 degree-squared
              area, to search for weak  lensing by the large scale structure of the universe,
              and  directly measure the mass power spectrum P(k). Such searches have  been
              severely limited by the narrow fields of view available  until now. This
              instrument should measure positions, shapes,  magnitudes and colors of ~1-2
              million galaxies in three years.
