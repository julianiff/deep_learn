Abstract    :
              9529207  Cowan    Fluctuations in the abundances of fish stocks result from 
              biotic and  environmental factors that affect the survival  of early life
              stages. Mortality from predation is a major  regulator of  year-class  size and
              its interaction with  larval growth rate  and  the time  at  which larvae are 
              vulnerabile to predators  may  be  the mechanisms  most  often  operating  in 
              the  sea.   This research focuses  on  an  alternative to  a  generally 
              accepted hypothesis for  larval recruitment, specifically, that growth rate and
               innate fitness, not simply size, influence survival  potential of larvae.  
              Data  from  ethological,  modeling  and  mesocosm experiments will provide a
              basis for  understanding the importance of predation on recruitment of  larvae
              to adult stocks.    ***
