Abstract    :
              9529075  Swift  These investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will study existing recordings of seismic shear waves from the
              Costa Rica Rift region in the eastern Pacific Ocean to study the variability of
              acoustic and physical properties of the upper 825 meters of the basaltic ocean
              floor.  The presence of good quality shear wave arrivals is rare in experiments
              carried out in this environment, and when combined with the compressional wave
              studies which have already been carried out from these same data, the shear
              waves provide important constraints on the rock properties.  The data were
              collected as part of a vertical seismic profiler (VSP) experiment with
              receivers located within Deep Sea Drilling Project hole 504B, the deepest
              penetration ever made into the ocean crust.  They provide an opportunity to
              define crustal properties at higher resolution than has been possible at any
              other location.  The project was proposed following the recognition of good
              quality shear wave arrivals in these data, and the investigators have developed
              new analytical techniques which make possible the first coincident study of
              borehole lithology (from drilling results), borehole porosity derived from
              in-situ logging, and the compressional and shear velocity information which is
              contained in the VSP data.  ***
