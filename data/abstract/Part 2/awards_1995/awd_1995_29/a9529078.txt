Abstract    :
              AST-9529078  Alan Stockton    Continuum Components in High-Redshift Galaxies.   
              The broad central theme of Dr. Stockton's research program is the  formation
              and evolution of galaxies over roughly the first third  of the history of the
              Universe.  The focus is on galaxies in the  redshift range 1 < z < 1.5,
              although one of the projects uses  such galaxies as a means to investigate
              episodes of star  formation at much earlier times and another project seeks an 
              understanding of a common phenomenon in radio galaxies at z > 0.8  through
              observations at much lower redshifts.
