Abstract    :
                9529990  IZENSON       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              Project will investigate a novel, multiphase mixing technique for combining and
              dispensing foamable compositions (such as polyurethane foams). Dispensers for
              foam ingredients are unreliable because the reactive ingredients must be
              thoroughly mixed inside the dispenser. Solids form inside the dispenser,
              eventually causing failure. The opportunity is to investigate a dispensing
              method that dramatically increases reliability, reduces costs, and produces
              high-quality foam. In this novel method, the foam ingredients are pre-mixed
              with a high concentration of tiny air bubbles to form "froths" prior to mixing.
              Mixing improves dramatically, and the dispensers can be made much more simple
              and reliable. The objective of the Phase II research is to understand and
              characterize basic phenomena to enable the design of an economical dispenser
              based on froth mixing. Specifically, we will focus on good foam quality,
              commercially useful, reliable operation, and simple processes for commercial
              applications. We will investigate: (1) methods to produce the proper multiphase
              mixing conditions, (2) methods to accomplish multiphase mixing, and (3) optimal
              foam quality as a function of mixing parameters. Results of the research will
              be data and analysis methods for the design of economical and reliable foam
              dispensers.  Research results from Phase II are key to developing reliable foam
              dispensers to produce high-quality foams for packaging, insulation, structures,
              and textiles.  The froth mixing process is novel, conceptually simple,
              reliable, easy to scale, and makes efficient use of foam reagents.
