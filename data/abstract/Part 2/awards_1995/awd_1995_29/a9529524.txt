              Instrumentation:  Investigation of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) Networks   
              The ARC is a Southern California consortium investigating ATM (Asynchronous
              Transfer Mode) for suitability as a high speed networking technology for
              advanced applications such as medicine, teleconferencing, and metacomputing. 
              ATM service is being provided by Pacific Bell and GTE, while the local premise
              equipment, switches and workstations, is being provided by each ARC member. 
              Using the ATM equipment provided by the CISE grant, experiments in the areas of
              remote learning, network management, and performance evaluation will be
              performed by HMC and CGS.  In the area of remote learning the ARC network will
              be used to support real-time interactive courses and seminars between HMC and
              CGS and other ARC members.  During such sessions ARC network performance and
              management will be investigated by HMC and CGS researchers.  Because of the
              high speed nature of ATM, new paradigms for performance and management will be
              developed by ARC researchers.  A primary goal of the research conducted by HMC
              and CGS will investigate through experiments the suitability of ATM for
              supporting advanced network applications. Without NSF support for an ATM switch
              and workstation, Harvey Mudd College and the Claremont Graduate School would be
              unable to participate actively in ARC activities.
