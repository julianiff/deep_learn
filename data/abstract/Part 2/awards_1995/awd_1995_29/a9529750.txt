Abstract    :
              9529750  BUSKEY    "Brown  tides" are persistent blooms of phytoplankton that
              reduce  the  penetration  of  sunlight in the  water  column.   A  direct 
              consequence  of this phenomenon is a reduction in the  growth  of  seagrass 
              beds which can reduce nursery habitats for  fishes  and  winter  food 
              resources for migrating waterfowl.   Completion  of  this  research  project 
              will provide  an  understanding  of  the  ecological  factors that regulate the
              initiation and  persistence  of  such  harmful algal blooms.  Field mesocosm
              experiments  will  investigate  the  effects  of nutrient additions  on  brown 
              tide  growth and phytoplankton species composition.  Laboratory studies  of 
              algal  growth rates will explore light, temperature, salinity  and allelopathic
              effects.    ***
