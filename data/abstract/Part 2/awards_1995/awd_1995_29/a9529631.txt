Abstract    :
              9529631  Sarid  This proposal describe a research plan to upgrade the capability
              of an existing UHV-STM  systems to study the time-dependent response of the
              local density of states (LDOS) for a variety of species adsorbed on metal and
              semiconductor nanostructures.  The PI proposes to use fast lasers for the
              photoexcitation of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor nanostructures. 
              The photoexcited carriers will modify the LDOS of the semiconductor and the
              carrier decay will be measured via the surface photovoltage generated.  In
              particular, the temporal response of the LDOS on an around atoms and molecular
              adsorbed on metal and semiconductor surfaces will be examined with
              sub-nanometer and sub-nanosecond resolution.  The modification of UHV-STM
              equipment will permit the study of the LDOS in the vicinity of the adsorbed
              molecules and determine the nature of their bonding.  The research will shed
              light on the intricate bonding of molecules to surfaces from both the spatial
              and temporal points of view.  ***
