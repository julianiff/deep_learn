Abstract    :
                CDA-9529470    Hanson, Eric N.  Johnson, Ted  Su, Stanley    University of
              Florida  Gainesville, FL    CISE Instrumentation:  Research in Parallel and
              Shared-nothing Database and Storage Systems    The University of Florida
              Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) department is
              undertaking the following three research efforts: (1) a project investigating
              the use of shared-nothing multiprocessors for fast rule processing in active
              database systems using a partitioned, parallelized discrimination network, (2)
              a project to develop and evaluate parallel techniques and algorithms for
              object-oriented knowledge-base management systems to support data partitioning
              and distribution, query processing, query optimization and knowledge rule
              processing using a network-of-workstations (NOW) environment, and (3) a project
              to develop high performance storage servers to allow storage and processing of
              data generated by high energy physics experiments.  All of these projects are
              experimental in nature, and involve implementing parallel software prototypes. 
              This experimentation is essential to help validate design proposals and get
              feedback on the designs to help refine and improve them.  The research
              instrumentation, consisting of four new high-speed workstations and a
              very-high-speed communication network, allows the construction of a parallel
              processor to conduct the work described.
