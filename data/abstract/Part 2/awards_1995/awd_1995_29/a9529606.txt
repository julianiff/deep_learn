Abstract    :
              9529606    McCartney    In this project PIs from Woods Hole and Scripps will
              carry out hydrographic   cruises enclosing a large portion of the North
              Atlantic Sub Polar Gyre (SPG)   between Greenland and the Azores.  The
              hydrography will form the base of a   much larger study of the circulation of
              the SPG, in which autonomous,   subsurface floats will monitor both subsurface
              currents and the upper layer   temperature and salinity structure over a
              two-year period.  The first section   will be occupied during the fall of 1996,
              in which floats will be deployed,   and currents will be monitored using
              shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current   Profilers.  The second section will be
              occupied in the Spring of 1997, and   will include a full suite of chemical
              tracers to assess the effects of winter   time mixing.  The principal goals are
              to study the transformation of the thick   upper layer of relatively warm water
              over the course of the winter, to   describe how that transformation is
              embedded in the general circulation of the   North Atlantic Current and SPG,
              and to examine the branching of eastward   flowing subtropical water from the
              North Atlantic Current into the SPG.    Attention will also be paid to
              entrainment of upper and intermediate waters   into deep overflows, the
              recirculation of intermediate and deep waters in the   subpolar North Atlantic
              and the distribution of decadal changes throughout the   subpolar region by
              comparison with historic data.
