                9529070  Wright  The objective of the NSTC Subcommittee on Construction and
              Building  is to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. industry, public safety 
              and environmental quality through research and development, in  cooperation
              with U.S. industry, labor, and academia, for  improvement of the life cycle
              performance of construction  facilities.      Conference/workshop is to be held
              to define mechanisms for the  private sector, the federal government, and
              building regulators to  collaborate in developing processes and products
              leading to  achievement of the National Construction Goals.  Private Sector R&D
               Program Implementation Plan for Advanced Technologies for  Constructed
              Facilities will be developed.
