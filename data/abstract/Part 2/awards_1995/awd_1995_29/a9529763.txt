Abstract    :
              9529763    Walsh    This  project  is  a contribution to the Atlantic 
              Circulation  and  Climate Experiment (ACCE), a component of a combined effort 
              on  the  part of NOAA's Atlantic Climate Change Program (ACCP), and  the U.S. 
              World  Ocean  Circulation Experiment (WOCE)  Program.  Three  major  centers,  
              including  NOAA's  National  Center  for  Environmental  Prediction  (NCEP), 
              are now producing reanalyses  by  assimilating  observational  data at frequent
              intervals into frozen  versions  of  numerical  weather  prediction  models.  
              Surface  fluxes  can   be  routinely  calculated from these reanalyses. In this
               project,  the  PIs  will  assess  the  utility of reanalysis-derived  flux 
              fields  relative  to  those  derived  from  historical  ship  observations, 
              satellite  data, in-situ measurements made in ACCE, and  elsewhere.  A  major 
              focus  will be on determining their utility  for  driving  ocean and climate
              models.
