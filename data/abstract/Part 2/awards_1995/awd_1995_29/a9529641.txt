Abstract    :
              9529641    Bray    In  this  project,  the  PI will supervise and  work  closely
               with  students  from  Indonesia to analyze, interpret, and  publish  data 
              collected  in a study of the Indonesian Throughflow.  The  flow  of  water 
              from the Pacific through the Indonesian Archipelago  to  the  Indian  Ocean  is
               a  problem  of  long-standing  interest  to  the  oceanographic community, and
              the PI, in collaboration with a number  of  other  US  institutions  and
              Indonesian  scientists,  has  made  significant progress in obtaining data that
              will allow this flow to  be  quantified.  Work has been carried out on an
              Indonesian vessel,  and  Indonesian  scientists,  as well as  Indonesian 
              students  are  intimately involved with the work.
