Abstract    :
              9529846    Pillsbury      In this project, the PI will assist in implementing
              phase 2 of ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for   Indonesian Throughflow), called
              ARLINDO Circulation (AC).  The objective is to study the   circulation and
              water mass stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a  
              thorough description of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport
              and dominant mixing   processes.  AC is specifically aimed at resolving the
              throughflow transport and velocity field   across the central passages of the
              Indonesian Seas, and extending hydrography to the eastern   Banda Sea. 
              Moorings are designed to measure the mean and variable current and thermohaline
                 stratification.  The PI in this award will be responsible for constructing
              and deploying the current   meter and temperature pod moorings under the
              direction of the lead PI, Gordon.
