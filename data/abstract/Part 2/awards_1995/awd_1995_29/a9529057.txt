Abstract    :
              9529057  Gaustad      A wide-angle imaging survey of the southern sky at the
              frequency of  the H-alpha emission line of Hydrogen at a wavelength of 656.3 nm
              will  be carried out.  The angular resolution of the observations will be 
              about one arcminute, and to a sensitivity level of one Rayleigh,  corresponding
              to an emission measure of 2 cm-6 pc, and to a brightness  temperature for
              microwave free-free emission of 6 microKelvin at 30  Ghz.  The system to be
              used to observe the radiation will be a Charge-  Coupled Device (CCD), a
              commercial camera lens, and narrow-band  interference filters, mounted on a
              robotic telescope.  The robotic  telescope will be deployed at the Cerro Tololo
              Inter-American  Observatory in Chile.  The project will require approximately
              one year  of observing time.  The results from the survey will allow accurate 
              measurements of fluctuations in the Galactic free-free emission from  Hydrogen
              at microwave wavelengths (or provide proof that these  emissions are
              negligible).   This emission must be subtracted from  satellite or ground-based
              measurements of the cosmic microwave  background to obtain the true microwave
              cosmic background  fluctuations.  The survey will produce detailed information
              on the  structure of the diffuse, warm, ionized component of the interstellar 
              medium, information which is necessary for understanding the physical 
              properties of the interstellar gas.  Participation by several  undergraduate
              students in the research project will enhance their  understanding of the
              nature of scientific research.  ***
