Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9529528  Reiter    Material handling is one of the common
              denominators involving virtually all processing of manufacturing operations. 
              Research on material handling can directly effect manufacturing costs and
              impact productivity.    This planning grant is studying the potential for
              getting sufficient industrial support to start a multi-university
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling Products
              and Process Engineering at Oregon State University and the University of
              Cincinnati.    The potential research agenda envisioned for the proposed Center
              will address:  Conformed Clamp Development, Lift Truck Dynamics, Design Process
              Assessment and Development, Lateral Clamp Development, Selection of a New
              Material Handling System for Service and Repair Operations, Planning and Design
              of Sortation Conveyor System for Warehousing and Distribution, Integrating
              Ergonomics Issues in Material Handling Equipment Design and Selection, and
              Designing Vision Guided Vehicles.    The researchers are recognized experts in
              these areas and can manage the activities of this planning award.
