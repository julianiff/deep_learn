Abstract    :
              9529813  MacCready  In this project, the PI will study the circulation ACROSS 
              the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, estimated to be about 1/3  as large as the
              circulation OF the ACC.  It is hypothesized  to be due to wind forcing.  This
              study will investigate the  sensitivity of the meridional circulation, both in
              strength  and depth distribution, to aspects of the forcing,  specificially to
              differences in wind stress, buoyancy flux,  bottom topography, and source-water
              availability, using an  existing, eddy-resolving, shallow-water equation
              numerical  model, formulated as a series of isopycnal layers.
