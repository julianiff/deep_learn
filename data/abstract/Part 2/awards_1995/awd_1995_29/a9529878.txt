Abstract    :
              Melting of the mantle can be investigated through experiments that  simulate the
              conditions and the composition of the mantle.  The  basalts that erupt on the
              sea floor and the melts produced in  experiments can be compared to imply the
              depth of melting, the  amount of melting of the mantle and temperatures in the
              mantle.   The principal investigator proposes to continue experiments with a 
              new and innovative technique that has already been used  successfully.  These
              experiments will lead to a better  understanding of melt generation in the
              mantle.
