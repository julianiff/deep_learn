Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to hold a workshop involving about forty leading  researchers
              from academia and industry to discuss:  1) the  importance and value of
              Structured Design Methods for MEMS; 2) the  research opportunities in this
              area, and, 3) the likely increase in  effectiveness of MEMS design utilizing
              these methods.
