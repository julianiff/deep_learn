Abstract    :
                  9529771  Molinari     This project involves the study of the influence of
              three aspects of large-scale atmospheric flow on tropical cyclogenesis. 
              Previous observational studies have suggested that interactions between the
              negative vorticity anomalies associated with upper tropospheric outflow from
              anticyclones and environmental positive vorticity anomalies are related to the
              strength of those anomalies.  A shallow water model will be used to conduct
              numerical experiments to try to better understand the nature of these
              interactions in subsequent tropical cyclone development.  The second part of
              the project involves an observational study of the role the direction of
              vertical wind shear in tropical cyclone development, particularly relative to
              the opposing influence of upper level vorticity. This will be accomplished
              using ECMWF gridded analyses.  The third part will consist of an examination of
              the role of the time-averaged potential vorticity field on the genesis and
              movement of  tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific through
              analysis of the ECMWF gridded fields and numerical modeling work.  ***
