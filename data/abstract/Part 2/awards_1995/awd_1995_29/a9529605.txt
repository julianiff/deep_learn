Abstract    :
              Van Scoy  OCE-9529605    An inert and safe chemical tracer will be released in
              the center of the Greenland   Sea gyre during the summer of 1996 to study
              mixing, convection and circulation   within the gyre, as well as exchange with
              the surrounding waters, and flow into the   North Atlantic through the Denmark
              Strait. The tracer will be sampled in November   1996, prior to winter
              convection, in March 1997, during or just after winter   convection, and again
              in May 1997. Samples will also be taken in the surrounding   waters and across
              the Denmark Strait on cruises through 1998 to study the paths   and rates of
              water mass exchange. This work is in collaboration with European   scientists
              (European Subpolar Ocean Programme Phase 2) and contributes to the   World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
