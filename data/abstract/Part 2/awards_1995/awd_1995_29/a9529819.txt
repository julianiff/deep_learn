Abstract    :
              P.I.: LUTZ, Richard A. Proposal #: 9529819           Keeping  in mind that the
              program weighs secondary considerations  in  the  individual award/no-award
              decisions, it is still informative to  look  at  the numerical rating
              statistics to have some feeling for the level  of  competition for available
              funds. For the regular panels, award  rates  are  currently  about 15% of the
              total proposals received. We have made  recent  efforts  to  let  the reviewers
              and panels know clearly what  the  general  level  of  competition for funds is
              like, expecting  that  evaluations  of  individuals   proposals  and 
              discrimination  among   proposal   will   be  influenced  to  a degree by this
              information. In this panel,  50%  of  the  proposals  had  average numerical
              mail review rankings  of  very  good  or  better  (~2.0 on a scale where
              1=Excellent and 5=Poor). With the pressures  of  increased  costs of doing
              research (and increased dollar  requests  in  proposals),  the  directive to
              make longer-term awards,  the  consistently  large  number of proposals
              submitted to the regular panels,  and  with  no  increases  in  funds  to 
              support research  in  areas  not  identified  as  strategic initiatives, the
              Program expects that we will continue  to  face  the  unpleasant  reality of
              not recommending many  important,  worthy  and  high-rated proposals for
              support by the Foundation.
