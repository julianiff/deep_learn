Abstract    :
              This project involves the Ph.D. research of a cultural anthropologist from Yale
              University, studying Khmer refugee communities in New England.  The student
              will compare three Cambodian refugee communities in Lowell and Fall River, MA,
              and Providence RI.  The   focus of the study is to understand how Khmer
              refugees deal with their economic, social   and cultural problems by using
              ethnically-based resources.  Through in-depth ethnographic participant
              observation, semi-structured interviews with a sample of about 100 individuals,
                and a survey of about 100 individuals in each site, the student will study
              how transnational connections lead to resources useful to the refugees, and how
              their self-identity as Khmer   assists and obstructs their access to valuable
              resources in their adopted US homeland.  This research is important because it
              will lead to advances in our understanding of how   refugee communities use
              their existing ties with their homeland and their self-defined and  
              other-defined identities as ethnic populations to adjust to their immigrant
              situations.  This   sort of understanding is increasingly more important as
              migration grows in volume and as   the conception of a `melting pot` where
              ethnic differences are blended into a new   homogenous US identity give way to
              an ideal of a democratic civil society composed of mutually cooperating
              distinctive groups.
