Abstract    :
              9529825  Yu    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
              explores a compact, high-gradient electron linear accelerator as an injector to
              a multiport, high-throughput, synchrotron X-ray radiation storage ring.  The
              device will be used in X-ray lithography machines for manufacture of
              microelectronic chips and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  Phase I
              produced a compact design for a full-energy injector that matches well to a
              superconducting storage ring X-ray source.  A pulsed septum and kicker magnet
              were also designed for use with full-energy injection.  Phase II will produce a
              detailed design of the X-ray source system and run simulation tests of high
              current stored and maintained in the compact ring using the new injection
              scheme.  In concurrent Phase III development, under private-sector funding, a
              commercial prototype of a new full-energy, high-gradient injector will be
              built.  By subcontract to Oxford Instruments of Carteret, NJ, Phase II will
              also modify a Helios 2 superconducting ring for full-energy injection.   
              Potential commercial applications are expected in a new generation of
              high-throughput X-ray machines for lithography at feature sizes finer than 0.18
              micron.  This is expected to enable a major expansion in quality and
              productivity of the microelectronics industry.  The new injection technology
              can also be adapted to MEMS microfabrication, which is also expected to grow
              significantly.
