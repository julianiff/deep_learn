Abstract    :
              AST  95-29175  PI:  Mitchell Begelman    Theoretical Investigations of
              Relativistic Jets and  Extragalactic Radio Sources    Clues to the nature of
              relativistic jets in extragalactic  radio sources--to their speed, composition,
              and internal  energy content--can be obtained by studying how they respond  to
              disturbances. Such disturbances are provided by Nature,  in the form of shocks,
              interactions with the ambient  radiation field, and hydrodynamic instabilities.
               Observations, at all wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays,  are now providing
              detailed information about the  morphologies, motions, and radiative properties
              of these  disturbances. This investigation is aimed at relating the  physical
              character of these disturbances to their  observational signatures, and
              determining how the  interactions of jets with the gas surrounding it in an 
              evolving cocoon affect the evolution and appearance of  extragalactic radio
              sources. Models will be developed for  particle acceleration at relativistic
              oblique shocks. The  effects of radiation drag on the magnetic acceleration of 
              jets, and whether the drag can trigger shocks, will be  investigated.
