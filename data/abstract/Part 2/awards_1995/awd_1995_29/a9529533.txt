Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9529533  Henderson-Kinney    There is a great need for field
              instrumentation that can address complex questions associated with the
              characterization and monitoring of hazardous waste sites.  Research at Tufts
              University is addressing many of these needs.    This is a planning grant to
              determine if Tufts University can obtain sufficient industrial support to
              become a research site of the New Jersey Institute of Technology's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Hazardous Waste
              Management.  Tufts University proposes to plan to become the sixth research
              site of the Center, the first outside of New Jersey.    Tufts University
              proposes to expand the multi-university Center's research agenda by addressing
              a Field Electrochemical and Microelectronic Program, A Fiber Optic Chemical
              Sensor Program, In Situ and On-site Characterization and Monitoring of
              Subsurface Contamination Program and a Field Characterization Program.    The
              researchers are recognized experts in their fields and can manage the
              activities of this planning grant.
