Abstract    :
              9529808  Melville  Funding is provided to the Marine Physical Laboratory at
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography to develop and test instrumentation for
              measuring entrained air and bubble size distributions in the ocean surface
              layer beneath breaking waves.  Bubbles in the ocean surface layer play an
              important role in air-gas transfer, in the generation of aerosols, in
              biological processes, and in the acoustics of the surface layer.  Laboratory
              data and preliminary field data suggest that air entrained by breaking waves
              may be dynamically significant through the work done against buoyant forces. 
              The instrument will be a broad band (2kHz -200kHz) system for in situ 
              measurements of the bubble size distribution in the surface layer by inverting
              direct measurements of sound speed and attenuation over path lengths of 0.1 - 
              1m.  The research will be split into two phases, a laboratory development and
              testing phase, followed by a field instrument and testing phase.
