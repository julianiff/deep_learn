Abstract    :
              9529807  Evans    Title: Collaborative research: physical properties of
              partially  molten feldspathic rocks in the ocean crust    The strength and
              deformation of the ocean crust depends primarily  on the strength of the lower
              crust (oceanic layer 3) which is  composed of gabbros. The strength of these
              rocks have not been  investigated in detail and this project is designed to
              determine  how the crust deforms when it is under pressure and when it is 
              partially molten. These results may explain why some mid-ocean  ridges have
              large axial valleys while others do not. The presence  of melt also affects the
              velocity of seismic waves and the  viscosity of gabbro depends on the amount of
              melt present and how  it is distributed in the rock. This study is designed to
              make these  measurements so that we can model the deformation of the ocean 
              crust and the velocity of seismic waves.
