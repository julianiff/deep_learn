              9520602  Manning    Title: The roots of hydrothermal systems at fast spreading
              centers:  constraints from Hess Deep    The circulation of seawater through the
              oceanic crust occurs at  various temperatures, along complicated pathways, and
              results in  chemical and mineralogical changes to the crust itself. This 
              proposed research is to determine how the physical processes of  deformation
              and fracturing of the crust are related to the chemical  processes of reactions
              involving seawater.  Characterization of the  geometry and patterns of
              fracturing, linked with mineralogical and  chemical changes recorded in the
              rocks, should form the basis for  a more comprehensive understanding of how
              seawater interacts with  the oceanic crust.
