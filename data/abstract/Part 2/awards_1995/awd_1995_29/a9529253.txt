Abstract    :
              9529253  French, James C.  University of Virginia    Special Project: NCSTRL: A
              National Computer Science Technical Report Library    This project proposes to
              integrate two successful existing on-line computer science technical report
              servers into a single service called the Networked Computer Science Technical
              Report Service, or NCSTRL.  The project will be carried out by a consortium of
              six universities which have been involved in the development of the two
              existing services, WATERS (Wide Area TEchnical Report Service) and Dienst,
              developed in the ARPA sponsored CS-TR project.  The technologies developed in
              these earlier projects will be integrated and extended to provide the new
              service.    After the completion of the integration effort, a major promotional
              effort is planned to increase the number of participating institutions.  To
              that end of the endorsement of the Computing Research Association has been
              secured.  The latter represents the PhD granting computer science departments
              in North America as well as several industrial laboratories that engage in
              fundamental research.    These activities are expected to lead to a service
              that will improve computer science research while providing cost savings to
              computer science departments.  It will be a valuable resource to the nation,
              and can be reached quickly and at a remarkably low cost.  ***
