Abstract    :
              9529564  Petraitis          The  goal  of this proposal is to determine the 
              ecological  mechanisms that maintain stands of algae and beds of mussels  and 
              barnacles  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine as distinct,  self-sustaining  communities.
                Mussels, barnacles, and macroalgae  are  the  most  common species on the
              rocky intertidal shores of sheltered  bays.  As  the  major  structural
              components of the natural  communities  that  line the shore, these species are
              the home for many species  of fish and invertebrates. Stands of rockweed and
              beds of mussels  and  barnacles are distinct and rarely overlap even  though 
              they  occupy  very  similar  places on the  shore.   Currently,  it  is 
              thought   that  local  site-specific  differences  in  ecological  processes  
              such  as  predation,  competition,  and  recruitment,  control  the species
              composition of these two communities.   This  research  project  will test the
              idea that the origins  of  algal  stands  and mussel-barnacle beds are
              historical events  and  that  once  established, the two distinctive
              communities are maintained  by  positive-feedback mechanisms within each.  Thus
               local  site-  specific differences are the result of positive-feedbacks and
              not  the  cause  of community differences.  In ecology, this  idea  is 
              generally  known  as "alternative stable states."   This  project  will  be 
              the  first large-scale test of this idea in  a  coastal  marine ecosystem.
