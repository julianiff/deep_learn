Abstract    :
              9529751  Wilson         Recent work has developed a very precise description of 
              relative motion of the Cocos, Nazca, and Pacific plates over the 5  million
              years. This project will expand the circuit to include the  Antarctic plate
              thus extending the motion of the Cocos and Nazca  plates to older times. These
              motions will allow the principal  investigator to address questions about the
              origin of microplates  and the rate at which plate motions change.
