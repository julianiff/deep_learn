Abstract    :
                This project will examine the processes for transfer of heat from the
              atmosphere into the permafrost at the Barrow Environmental Observatory on the
              North Slope of Alaska.  Data loggers will be installed at 3 m depth in the soil
              at numerous sites to monitor the effects moisture on heat transfer during the
              seasonal freeze/thaw cycle of the upper permafrost layer.  The data will be
              used to establish how moisture and climate affect the permafrost so that the
              potential effects of climate change on the permafrost layer may be predicted. 
              The research will test a new theory about the way permafrost responds to
              seasonal temperature changes in order to examine the role that global warming
              may play on the surficial frozen soil layer in the arctic.  The results are
              critically important to planning for the potential impacts of proposed climate
              change on the construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure in the
              arctic.
