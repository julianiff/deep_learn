Abstract    :
              9529970  Taylor      The primary goal of this research is to advance and use a
              method,  which can easily by employed by the scientific community, for 
              measuring species specific growth rates of phytoplankton.  The  method follows
              a progression of developments from the frequency  of dividing cells technique,
              to the diel DNA synthesis method, to  the cell cycle approach for measuring
              growth rates.  With this  method a conserved cell cycle protein, PCNA
              (proliferating cell  nuclear antigen) is used as a marker of cells which are
              about to  divide.  Fluorescent antibodies are used to detect PCNA, and a 
              standard epifluorescence microscope is used for detecting  presence or absence
              of antibodies and identifying species of  phytoplankton, thus making the method
              available to a broad range  of investigators.  This research builds upon and
              advances  established methodology and will benefit a large segment of the 
              biological oceanographic community.  One of the major goals of  plankton
              biologists is to understand the causes of blooms and the  contribution of
              individual species as primary producers.  The  research will establish a sound,
              fast affordable and rugged  method for measuring species specific growth rates,
              and will also  provide basic information on cell cycle proteins in 
              phytoplankton.  ***
