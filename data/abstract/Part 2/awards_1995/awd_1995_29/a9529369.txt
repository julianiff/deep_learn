Abstract    :
              9529369  Sullivan    This proposal seeks to lay a mathematical foundation for
              the continuum model of fluid motion in three dimensions. This relates to the
              investigator's earlier works on applying smooth manifold techniques to
              topological manifolds. The proposed  research also deals with the newly
              discovered monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten: the proposal aims to
              determine exactly what structures the Seiberg-Witten invariants depend on.   
              The fluid motion dynamics can be described by a system of nonlinear partial
              differential equations. There are traditional difficulties with the partial
              differential equation approach in that the system often is not smooth enough.
              The proposed research aims to introduce topological techniques not requiring
              any smoothness to these systems of equations.
