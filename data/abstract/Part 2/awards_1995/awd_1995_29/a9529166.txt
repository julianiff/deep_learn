Abstract    :
              This dissertation project will provide experimental and  naturalistic studies of
              the first language acquisition of  children between the ages of three and six
              years of age acquiring  Inuktitut (a language of the Eskimo-Aleut family) as
              their first  language in Igloolik, N.W.T., Canada. This research will be 
              particularly significant because (i) it will contribute to  providing
              foundational knowledge on the acquisition of languages  with highly complex
              morphology; (ii) it will examine the  concurrent acquisition of syntax and
              morphology, and the ways in  which the child's developing knowledge of one
              might contribute to  knowledge of the other; (iii) it will investigate aspects
              of the  human cognitive competence for language in the context of a  language
              (and a language family) which has been little studied to  date; and (iv) it
              will provide important descriptive information  on a North American language in
              an area where there is current  concern about severe language loss.
