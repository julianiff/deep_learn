Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support for the activities of the 
              Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR).  NSF is  one of
              twelve Federal agencies and 13 industry/university  partnerships providing core
              financial support to GUIRR.  The  Roundtable has two objectives:  to provide a
              place where national  leaders from all sectors of the research enterprise can
              discuss in  candor and in a structured way opportunities and issues that 
              challenge or trouble them; and, to contribute to national policy by 
              structuring and illuminating issues, and injecting imaginative  thought into
              policy deliberations.  The Roundtable's agenda  focusses on the central issues
              facing the research enterprise,  particularly where there are conflicts and
              differing perspectives  between the sectors.
