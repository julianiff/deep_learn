Abstract    :
              9529626  Pineda      The mechanisms that influence larval transport and
              recruitment  must be understood in order to predict the species composition 
              and population dynamics of benthic communities.  This project  will study the
              onshore movement of larvae by large internal tidal  bores.  Several new
              questions dealing with small-scale mechanics  and larger-scale spatial
              consequences of this physical process  will be addressed.  Specifically,
              studies will examine the  relationships between the characteristics of internal
              bores,  internal wave regimes, and larval behaviors.  ***
