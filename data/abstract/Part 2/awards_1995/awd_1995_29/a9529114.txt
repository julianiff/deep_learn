Abstract    :
              9529114  Wu   The objective of this project is to organize a two-day workshop in
              the area of manufacturing logistics to bring together practitioners and
              researchers from industry, universities, and software development firms. The
              focus of the workshop is to develop a joint industry-university research agenda
              in manufacturing logistics so as to bridge the gap between theory and practice
              in areas such as production planning, scheduling, information and material
              management, and shop floor monitoring and control.  The workshop will foster
              debate and discussion of pressing issues in industry, and cultivate a wide
              spectrum of interactions and future collaboration between researchers,
              practitioners, and software developers. The results of the workshop will be
              disseminated through several published channels.   A gap currently exists
              between the researcher and practice of manufacturing logistics. one main reason
              for the gap is the lack of communication between these three groups. A workshop
              which brings people from  the application, development, and research domain
              will foster communication between these groups. Improved communication and the
              exchange of ideas will enhance research and application of manufacturing
              logistics. Reduction of the gap between theory and application will obviously
              be of benefit to manufacturing in America. Both students and faculty alike will
              benefit from such collaboration by building models that more truly reflect
              logistics problems as experienced by industry.
