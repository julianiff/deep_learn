Abstract    :
              CDA-9529462    Burleson, Wayne P.  Ganz, Aura    University of
              Massachusetts-Amherst    Equipment for Real -Time System Protyping    The
              development of real-time embedded computing systems requires a combination of
              software simulation and hardware emulation to verify functionality and estimate
              performance, costs, power consumption and reliability.  The requested equipment
              is for the development of a generic approach to the prototyping  of real-time
              systems as well as specific hardware and software for applying this approach to
              ongoing research projects in Wireless Networks and Real-time Robotics.  The
              equipment consists of a small network of Personal Computers which run Computer
              Aided Design tools for software simulations as well as serving as hosts for
              hardware emulation systems based on microprocessors and digital signal
              processors.  Together , the entire system allows the rapid development,
              verification and analysis of systems which could not be explored by either
              simulation or emulation alone.  In particular, it allows the statistical study
              of data-dependent and environment-dependent properties which are difficult to
              model analytically and too slow using traditional software simulation.
