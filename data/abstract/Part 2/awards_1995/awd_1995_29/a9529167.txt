Abstract    :
              AST-9529167  Stuart Vogel  Sylvain Veilleux    Measuring the Metagalactic
              Ionizing Flux and the Gaseous Extent  of Galaxies Using Optical Fabry-Perot
              Spectrophotometry.    Drs. Vogel and Veilleux will carry out a program to
              determine the  intensity of the local metagalactic ionizing radiation (the 
              ionizing background at zero redshift produced by the sum of all  sources) and
              to study diffuse ionized gas beyond the neutral  disks of galaxies.  For this
              work a wide-field imaging Fabry-  Perot spectrometer will be installed on the
              Palomar 60-inch  telescope.  ======================================
