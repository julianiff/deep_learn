Abstract    :
              AST  95-29230  PI:  Omer Blaes         Optical/Ultraviolet Emission from active
              Galactic Nuclei         The origin of the optical/UV spectrum in Active
              Galactic Nuclei is not currently understood. X-ray observations suggest that
              the standard thin accretion disk paradigm be altered in such a way that a
              substantial fraction of the gravitational energy be transferred and released
              outside the optically thick portion of the disk, but it is not clear that such
              a model can explain all the optical/UV observations. The PI will investigate
              the consequences of two-phase models (disk and overlying hot corona) for the
              optical and ultraviolet observations, concentrating in particular on the
              spectrum and polarization that a non-LTE, self-consistent, atmosphere code
              would produce. The model, which assumes that the disk and corona are locally
              coupled at each radius, will explore the parameter space defined by the
              fraction of accretion power dissipated in the corona and the coronal optical
              depth. The UV/optical response to X-ray variability will also be studied.
