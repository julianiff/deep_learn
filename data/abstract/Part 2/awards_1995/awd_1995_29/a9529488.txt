Abstract    :
              CDA 9529488  Hughes, Herman D.  McKinley, Philip K.  Mutka, Matt W.    Michigan
              State University    CISE Research Instrumentation for ATM Networking    The
              Computer Science Department at Michigan State University (MSU) requested
              support to purchase equipment for upgrading an existing research laboratory,
              the High-Speed Networking & Performance Laboratory (HSNP).  HSNP was
              established in 1993, with primary support from NSF and additional funds from
              the AT&T Foundation and MSU.  This Laboratory supports a testbed that consists
              of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches interconnected by fiber optics
              links to a collection of SPARC-10 workstations.  In order to serve the growing
              number of faculty and students (both graduate and undergraduate) interested in
              experimental research activities associated with the mission of HSNP,
              additional equipment is needed.  The equipment essential for upgrading the
              current facilities to provide expanded research opportunities includes: (1) An
              ATM traffic generator/analyzer, (2) OC-3 upgrade packages for existing ATM
              switches and Interface cards, (3) An ATM SynOptics switch and Interface card,
              (4) A RAID disk storage system, (5) ATM-related software, and  (6) Advanced
              multimedia workstations.   This requested equipment will be used to enhance
              both the quality and scope of on-going as well as future research in ATM
              technology (e.g., multimedia traffic modeling, traffic policing mechanisms,
              bandwidth allocation algorithms, buffer management schemes, and admission
              control algorithms) and in high-speed networking issues in distributed parallel
              computing, performance analysis, and interoperability.  The results of this
              research will contribute to the development of ATM technology to support
              multimedia applications over high-speed networks.
