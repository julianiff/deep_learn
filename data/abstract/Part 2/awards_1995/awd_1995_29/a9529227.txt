              Fast Queries and Updates in Probabilistic Networks    Knowledge representation
              using networks is one of the most  promising approaches to Artificial
              Intelligence.  The main  goal of another current grant to the same investigator
              is to  develop very efficient algorithms for network-based AI tools  such as
              constraint networks and probabilistic networks,  focusing on utilizing parallel
              processing to achieve  execution time that is sub-linear in the size of the 
              network.  A by-product of this existing project recently was  several new
              compilation strategies for probabilistic  networks that allow, after fast
              preprocessing, the  processing of both queries and updates in time that is 
              logarithmic in the size of the database.  This represents an  exponential
              improvement in current algorithms.  At present,  the techniques are known to be
              applicable to certain special  cases, but it appears possible to extend them to
              more  general networks. If they can be extended  adequately, it  will have a
              strong impact on technology, given the wide  applicability of the ability to
              define, manipulate, and  update probabilistic information.  This small grant
              for  exploratory research is to explore the applicability of  these techniques,
              which were not a part of the existing  grant's research plan.
