Abstract    :
              9529949  Kochar    While poverty is generally associated with low rates of
              saving, a  striking feature of a number of developing countries is the 
              coexistence of extreme poverty with high savings rates.  In the  South Asian
              economies, for example, poverty coexists with  household savings rates which
              average 16% of disposable income.   In such economies income growth appears to
              be constrained not so  much by the rate of savings but by the apparent
              willingness of  households to hold their savings in relatively low yielding 
              forms.  Understanding why this is so is critical for designing  policy which
              enhances the productivity of savings, and,  correspondingly, increases income. 
              Surprisingly, there is little  empirical research on this topic, despite its
              obvious importance.   This research planning grant will permit the investigator
              to  develop an empirical research program on the relative importance  of
              expected marriage payments and the variability in earnings as  motives for
              household savings in south Asian economies.    This research carries important
              policy implications.  The belief  that income uncertainty and credit
              constraints motivate household  savings and contribute to the poverty of
              households has resulted  in an influential literature which advocates
              interventions in  credit and insurance markets.  In contrast, if households
              save  for consumption expenses and if it is this which diverts assets  from
              income-enhancing investments, the more effective policy  would target
              investments in areas such as women's education and  employment which may have
              the effect of reducing dowry payments.
