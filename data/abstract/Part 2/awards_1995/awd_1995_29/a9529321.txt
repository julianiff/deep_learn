Abstract    :
                  9529321  Cotton     In this project, the principal investigator and
              colleagues will examine some of the proposed mechanisms by which anthropogenic
              cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) may alter the microstructure, macrostructure,
              and radiative properties of marine stratocumulus clouds.  The research should
              provide important insights necessary for the development of improved
              parameterization of aerosol/cloud microphysics/ cloud dynamics interactions
              that can be used in large-scale atmospheric models.       The research involves
              the application of a sophisticated large eddy simulation (LES) model with
              explicit, bin-resolving microphysics (EM).  The approach will be to perform
              cloud-resolving simulations of cases observed during the Atlantic Stratocumulus
              Transition Experiment (ASTEX) and to evaluate the credibility of those
              simulations by comparing the simulated data with observed cloud features.  The
              PI will also perform sensitivity experiment in which the concentrations and
              vertical profiles of CCN are varied.  From these simulations, he hopes to
              determine if modest increases in concentrations of CCN directly alter cloud
              albedo significantly, or alter cloud coverage, or alter entrainment in the
              cloud boundary layer, or whether the marine boundary layer may be bistable with
              respect to the production rates of CCN.     This project is being supported as
              a contribution to NSF's Role of Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global Climate
              Change (ROCEW) Program.  ***
