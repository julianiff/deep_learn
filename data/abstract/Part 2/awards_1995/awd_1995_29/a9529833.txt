              The gases carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor are transported  from the
              mantle to the atmosphere in volcanic eruptions. Some of  these gases are
              trapped in veins and minerals at various stages in  the evolution of magmas as
              they form the ocean crust. The PIs wish  to determine the abundance and
              isotopic composition of these gases  which they think will tell us about the
              evolution of the formation  of the ocean crust. These gases will also help us
              understand how  much carbon is transported from the interior of the Earth to
              the  surface.
