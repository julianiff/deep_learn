Abstract    :
              9529959  Brown    Smectite abundances in accretionary wedges influence
              distribution  of water within and expulsion of water from the wedges. Smectite 
              dehydrates to illite when interlayered water is expelled. Previous  study by
              the PI shows promise and a continued time series study is  proposed to focus on
              the coupling between physical and chemical  processes. Synthetic sediments will
              be reacted with fluids at  elevated temperature to observe how
              porosity/permeability evolve  and how textural and physical properties change.
              In future phases  of this experimentation, the simple system will be subjected
              to  increasing degrees of complexity and eventually to natural samples.
