Abstract    :
              9529139  Jablonski  The haloalkaliphilic archaebacteria play an important
              ecological role in high pH hypersaline environments.  Little is known about
              these microorganisms at both the biochemical and genetic levels.  Many of the
              enzymes which these organisms synthesize may be biotechnologically important
              and techniques are needed to manipulate the genes encoding these proteins.  The
              goal of this exploratory research project is to develop a transformation
              procedure for the haloalkaliphilic arachaebacteria ( Natronococcus and
              Natronobacterium spp.).  This will allow "classical" genetic analysis of these
              organisms, and the reintroduction of archaebacterial genes into the
              haloalkaliphiles, including genes that have been altered in vitro.
