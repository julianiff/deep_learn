Abstract    :
                This proposal requests travel support for U.S. participants  in the
              International Seminar-Cum-School On Macromolecular  Crystallographic Data that
              will be held in Calcutta from  November 16th to the 20th, 1995.  This workshop
              focuses on  the use and implementation of structural biology databases  and 
              their application to research problems such as  structure-based drug design,
              protein engineering and  structure analysis.  This workshop is sanctioned by
              the  International Union of Crystallography Commission on  Biological
              Macromolecules and is part of efforts to insure  that all of the international
              community has access to the  repositories and contributes to the development of
              these  critical resources.  The workshop will focus on teaching the  most
              current methodology and techniques for deposition,  validation, retrieval and
              use of macromolecular structural  data, and the application to specific
              research problems that  include drug design and protein engineering.  The
              workshop  in India is timely because of the recent expansion of Indian 
              scientists will enhance the developing research programs and  provide
              scientists from throughout the world access to data  that results from the
              success of these efforts.
