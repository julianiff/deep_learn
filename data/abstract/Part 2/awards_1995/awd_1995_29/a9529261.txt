Abstract    :
              Stern  OCE-9529261  The role that large scale eddies play in determining the
              structure of, and   entrainment in, oceanic jets like Western Boundary Currents
              will be studied using   analytical methods and simple numerical models. The
              specific objectives of this   research are: (1) to explain the behavior of
              barotropic jets emerging from a source   on the wall of a rotating laboratory
              tank; (2) to understand the bifurcation dynamics   of a wall jet normally
              incident on a continental slope/shelf region; (3) to determine   the increase
              in maximum mean inshore shear of continental boundary currents like   the
              Florida Current; and (4) to extend the linear theory of a "self propagating"  
              barotropic eddy in a shear flow to the non-linear case.
