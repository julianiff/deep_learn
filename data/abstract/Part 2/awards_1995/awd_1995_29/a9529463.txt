Abstract    :
                CDA-9529463     Peshkin, Michael A.  Mirkovic, Srdjan    Northwestern
              University    Robot for Human Workspace    The requested equipment of computer
              hardware and software for real-time control of     robotics systems is used in
              furtherance of research in computer and information science and engineering in
              the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer
              Engineering.  The real time control and computation system is associated with
              the robot requested under this proposal and other robots in several closely
              related projects.  Specific research tasks are as follows.  (1) Research and
              development of robot-assisted surgical systems.  Most immediately, a system for
              directing linear insertions, such as biopsies and orthopedic pins, under
              fluoroscopic imaging.  These systems require fast dedicated computers for
              control, and a 6-axis force sensor to facilitate interaction with a surgeon.  
              (2) Research and development of assertive devices to be used in the final
              assembly of automobiles and light trucks, with General Motors.  This project
              requires a considerable amount of high-speed real-time digital signal
              processing hardware, and associated software.
