Abstract    :
              9529570  Evans  This project will undertake two complementary activities. 
              First,  a joint team of American and Japanese architects will gather data  on
              the architectural and urban design lessons to be learned from  the Great
              Hanshin earthquake.  The data gathering effort will  document and analyze the
              impacts of the earthquake from the  specific standpoint of the architectural ad
              urban design  professions.  Following the data gathering activity, a workshop 
              will be convened in Washington, DC to present project findings,  develop
              recommendations for future design and planning policy,  and identify needed
              areas of research.  ***
