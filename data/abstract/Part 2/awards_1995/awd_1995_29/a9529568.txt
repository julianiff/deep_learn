Abstract    :
              Abstract  Girshick  CTS-9529568      A request has been made for funding to
              support fixed conference fees for invited speakers at the 1996 Gordon Research
              Conference on Plasma Processing Science, to be held at New Hampton School in
              New Hampshire during August, 1996.  The meeting is expected to be attended by
              leading figures in plasma processing, as well as by students and researchers
              who are relatively new in their careers.  The meeting will focus on the
              fundamental science of plasmas in the context of industrial processes where
              they are used.  The emphasis will be on basic phenomena and research techniques
              rather than on applications.
