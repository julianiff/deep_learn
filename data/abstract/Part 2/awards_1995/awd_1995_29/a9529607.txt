Abstract    :
              Joyce  9529607  Top to bottom hydrographic and current measurements will be 
              carried out  along two meridional lines at 66 W and 52 W in the North  Atlantic
              as  part of the "Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment"  (ACCE) of the 
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic  prgoram. The main 
              objectives of the work are to obtain a quantitative  description of the North 
              Atlantic circulation and water mass distribution, and  compare this state to 
              similar basin-wide descriptions from two previous era: the  International 
              Geophysical Year (IGY) period of the late 1950s' and the  early 1980s'. The 
              overall goal is to characterize these snapshots in terms of  climate 
              variability, with the hope of furthering our understanding  of the time scales 
              and mechanisms of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.
