Abstract    :
              9529575  Terray    Detailed measurements of surface layer velocity shear will
              make  using a new vorticity sensor to test the conjecture that the  spanwise
              averaged shear in the downwind current is the same as in  a shear flow over a
              solid boundary.  It is expected that an  improved understanding of turbulent
              mixing near the surface will  benefit studies of processes like air-sea gas
              exchange,  phytoplankton dynamics and the mixing of nutrients and  pollutants.
