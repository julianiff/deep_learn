              presentation refers to the concurrent presentation of multimedia data using
              monitors for text, video or still images, and  speakers for audio.  Each
              presentation contains multimedia segments retrieved from a database, and is
              constructed and played out by a presentation manager software. This research
              has three components.  (a) A prototype system is developed to automate the
              assembly of presentations from multimedia databases for beginning computer
              users.  The system is then revised and evaluated in different application
              domains. One example is a Course-Assistant software in education.   (b) A
              presentation construction language for intermediate computer users is
              implemented and evaluated in different application domains.  The language
              provides control on the number and contents of concurrent segments in a
              presentation, and has the ability to specify playout-time changes in a
              presentation, and communication and synchronization among multiple playout
              managers.  (c) For advanced users, a presentation manipulation language is
              developed and evaluated.     The development is carried out on multimedia
              personal computers  with MPEG capture and playout capabilities and on
              workstations,  acquired by the instrumentation grant. The development platforms
               are Windows NT and UNIX.
