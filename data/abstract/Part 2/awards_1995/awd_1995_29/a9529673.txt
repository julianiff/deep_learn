Abstract    :
              9529673  Jain  The binding of circulating cells in the blood to the  vascular
              wall is a key step in many physiological processes,  e.g., inflammation, wound
              healing, cancer metastasis, etc.  Previous studies have neglected the impact of
              red blood  cells (RBC's), a major blood component (up to 40% by volume)  on the
              adhesion of these circulating cells to the  endothelial vascular lining.  Three
              key questions to be  answered are:       What effect do the RBC's have on the
              rates of cell    "rolling" and binding of  lymphocytes and cancer cells to   
              endothelial cell monolayers?       Are the observed effects biochemical and/or
              physical in  nature?       Can a theoretical framework be developed to model
              the  RBC-enhanced adhesion?    The main hypothesis is that the RBC's will
              enhance the  adhesion of the cells to the endothelial lining.  The  hypothesis
              will be tested in a laminar flow chamber.  The  researchers are already
              familiar with the test chamber and  the specified cells.  ***
