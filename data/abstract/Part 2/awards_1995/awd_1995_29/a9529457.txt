Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Pittsburgh.  The student will assess the cultural and
              economic viability of a development project to reintroduce a prehispanic system
              of agriculture, using raised fields, to the Lake Titicaca region of Bolivia. 
              The student's thesis is that today's raised field agricultural technology is a
              creation of middle class development specialists who use it to advance their
              ideal of prehispanic culture and obtain funds from international development
              agencies, while the technology may not be the most appropriate development
              strategy for the indigenous peasants it is being promoted to.  Using techniques
              of ethnographic participant observation and surveys of 80 households involved
              in various types of raised field experiments (as well as a control group of
              households not involve in raised field agriculture) the student will assess the
              viability and impact of the raised fields for sustainable development.  This
              research is important because it will increase our expertise about this region
              of the world, while at the same time providing an significant case study to
              assess a development strategy.  This general region is extremely poor, and the
              advance in our understanding of viable development strategies will be valuable
              for regional development planners.  In addition this case study of the
              `invented tradition` of raised field agriculture will be very useful to
              theorists of economic development who try to understand why projects come into
              existence, flourish or fail.
