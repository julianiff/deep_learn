              University of Texas- Arlington    Design of a Distributed Computing Environment
              Using Power PC Micro Kernel    The goal of this project is to investigate,
              design, and develop a unique distributed computing environment using a cluster
              of 12 networked PowerPcs.  The uniqueness of the proposed research is based on
              the development of a set of tailor-made, PowerPC micro kernel routines to
              efficiently manage the overall system for a specific, large-scale AI
              application:  parallel knowledge discovery from large complex databases.  The
              main objectives are:  (1) Developing a set of new and unique load balancing
              schemes for management of distributed systems.  The schemes will be tailored
              for AI applications and implemented using the PowerPC micro kernel routines. 
              (2)  Developing a new distributed system for parallel knowledge discovery from
              large complex databases.  The application will be carried out using the
              computing facility and proposed load balancing environment.
