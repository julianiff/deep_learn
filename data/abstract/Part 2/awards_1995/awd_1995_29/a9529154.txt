Abstract    :
              AST  95-29154  PI:  Edmund Bertschinger         Cosmological Dynamics and
              Gravitational Lensing    This proposal requests funding for several theoretical
              projects  involving dynamics in cosmology. The aims are to develop  analytical
              methods for describing nonlinear gravitational  instability and gravitational
              lensing and to investigate  observational consequences of these phenomena. The
              evolution of  correlation functions and the matter distribution within 
              virialized objects will be studied analytically and with  numerical models.
              Local Lagrangian approximations to weakly  nonlinear evolution will be further
              tested and applied.  Gravitational lensing theory using Hamiltonian dynamics
              will be  further developed and applied to multiple weak lensing by  structures
              in the universe. Lensing studies will focus on  quadruple lenses as possible
              indicators of the enhancement and  modification of primary lens effects.
