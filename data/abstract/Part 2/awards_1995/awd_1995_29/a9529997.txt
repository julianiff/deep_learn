Abstract    :
              9529997  McCorkle      In this project, the principal investigator will the
              relationship  between benthic foraminifera, organic matter deposition pore
              water  chemistry , and solids chemistry in sediment cores taken seasonally 
              from the sea floor of Georges Bank. The central objective is to  study the
              details of the so-called "Mackensen effect" - the  apparent decrease in the
              fraction of 13C in the carbon content of  benthic forams in response to the
              deposition of fresh organic  matter produced in the overlying water column. 
              These studies will  help quantify the impact of seasonal cycles of ocean
              productivity  on benthic foraminiferal proxies of paleoproductivity and on
              carbon  cycling at the sea floor.
