Abstract    :
              AST-9529232    Dr. Fesen will use this award to develop a new observational 
              technique for identifying young supernova remnants in nearby  galaxies.  If
              successful, the observations could revolutionize  the study of supernova
              remnants at early phases, which currently  are largely undetectable in more
              traditional emission-line  imaging or radio continuum surveys.
