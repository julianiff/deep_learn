Abstract    :
              9529351  Edmond      It is very important to develop non-conservative tracers,
              i.e.  transient anthropogenic species sensitive to biological and  geochemical
              processes going on in the oceanic water column. At  present the only such
              species for which information is available is  anthropogenic lead (Shen and
              Boyle, 1988). It is derived from  automobile exhaust and, to a much lesser
              extent, from the smelting  of sulfide ores and other high temperature
              processes.  Thus its  atmospheric sources is predominantly confined to the
              Northern  Hemisphere. Lead is strongly reactive with biogenic particles.  
              Hence the fate of the transient can be used to study solute-  particle
              scavenging reactions with a high degree of resolution (  Sherrell and Boyle,
              1986). What is lacking is a tracer directly  involved in the cycle of organic
              carbon with a strong signal.   129I, which is released in tremendous quantity
              from nuclear fuel  reprocessing plants, has the potential to fill this role. 
              Initial  results from measurements in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, the 
              overflows around Iceland, the Labrador Sea and the North Atlantic  show that
              the isotope is enriched in surface waters, the overflows  and the deep
              Greenland, Norwegian and Labrador Seas, i.e. similar  to 3H at a comparable
              stage in its evolution.  However the  penetration depth into the main
              thermocline in the North Atlantic  appears significantly greater suggesting
              biogenic diapycnal  transport, consistent with the biophilic nature of iodine. 
                  Measurements of I-129/I-127 ratios in selected archived samples  will be
              made to develop I-129 as a non-conservative tracer and  establish limits for
              its interpretation in biologically active  environments.
