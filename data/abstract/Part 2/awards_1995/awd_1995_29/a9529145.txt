Abstract    :
              9529145  Sidhu    Telenix Corporation - "Simulation and Analysis of Mobile-IP
              Protocol"  This award supports a one year project to conduct simulations of
              mobile-IP  and present the results through the Internet Engineering Task Force
              to  designers of mobile-IP software.  The purpose is to provide data to assist 
              in understanding the mobile-IP environment to guide implementations now in 
              preparation.  It is aimed primarily at IPv4, though the results will be  useful
              for IPv6 as well.
