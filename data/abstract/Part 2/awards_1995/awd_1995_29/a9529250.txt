Abstract    :
                  SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics    This project is
              a series of Interdisciplinary Conference in  Applied Mathematics conducted by
              the Society for Industrial and  Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  The conferences
              are designed to  bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who
              are  developing and applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and 
              algorithms.  An important feature of this series is the inclusion  of focused,
              interdisciplinary, academic/industry workshops in  which mathematical and
              computational scientists from academia can  interact with mathematicians,
              computational scientists,  engineers, and scientists in industry on specific
              areas and  problems of interest to industry.  The primary objective of the 
              conferences is to initiate new interaction among the creators and  users of
              mathematics and thereby contribute to the understanding  of mathematics and
              encourage its application to problems of  society.  A second objective is to
              encourage the participation of  students, women, and minority groups in this
              interaction.
