              by all kinds of people, especially those with limited technical acumen or
              know-how and those with various disabilities.  Therefore, an interdisciplinary
              group (computer scientists and other relevant disciplines) will evaluate and
              suggest fruitful directions for progress in user interfaces.  A two-day

              by the steering committee.  A workshop would serve to bring together
              individuals from different disciplines, perspectives/schools of thought, and
              activities (research, product development, and so on) to identify and begin to
              narrow down the capabilities of desirable ordinary citizen interfaces (OCIs).

              in the near-term human-computer communications de sign, and identify important
              long-term research issues.  Further, there is a need to promote
              university-industry collaboration to provide reality-checks on the utility of
              research and to create theoretical bases for development, enhancing the
              application of research.
