Abstract    :
              AST 9529454    Discovery and Analysis of Extremely Low Metallicity Stars, 
              Horizontal-Branch Stars, and A-Type Stars in the Galaxy.    Dr. Beers will
              continue a research program of studying a large  sample of very metal poor
              stars.  Such research is valuable for  knowledge about nucleosynthesis, the
              distribution of elements in  metal poor stars, and gradients across our Galaxy
              in the colors  of horizontal-branch stars.  Obtaining the stellar distribution 
              function in metallicity, kinematics, and space is a good way to  try to
              understand the formation and evolution of the Galaxy.
