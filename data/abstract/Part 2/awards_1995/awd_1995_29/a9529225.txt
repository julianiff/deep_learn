Abstract    :
              AST  95-29225  PI:  Lev Kofman    Inflation and the Origin of Matter in the
              Universe         According to inflationary cosmology, all the elementary 
              particles which we see now were not present at the moment of  the Big Bang, but
              were created by the decaying scalar field  at the end of the inflationary
              stage. The process of  creation of matter during the decay of the scalar field
              and  the subsequent process of thermalization of the created  particles is
              called reheating. The theory of reheating is  still incomplete, and is
              interrelated with the dark matter  problem. Recent studies by the PI and his
              colleagues have  discovered more efficient methods of reheating which have 
              important implications for cosmological models. For example,  standard
              inflation theory results in a flat universe (Omega  = 1); with different
              reheating parameters, a different  distribution of density fluctuations may
              result, with a  different amount of dark matter. Since current observations 
              produce densities well below those of a flat universe, the  amount of dark
              matter can be critical in establishing  whether inflation theory does indeed
              hold. The PI intends to  investigate the production of elementary particles
              when the  new reheating methods are allowed for, and to examine the  influence
              of the cosmological constant on the models with  the new reheating methods,
              using an analytic approach.
