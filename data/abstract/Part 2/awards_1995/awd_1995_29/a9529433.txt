Abstract    :
              9529433 Lawler   Abstract    The proposal requests funds to partially support
              the 1996 Seminar on Stochastic Processes to be held at the University of
              Florida March 14-16, 1996.  This will be the sixteenth in a series of annual
              conferences, begun in 1981, giving eminent researchers, young specialists and
              graduate students the opportunity to work together to discuss the most recent
              advances in stochastic analysis, potential theory and Markov processes.  There
              will be five formal one-hour lectures and about nine hours of shorter and more
              informal presentations.  At the informal sessions, seminar participants
              volunteer to give short presentations of their current research.  For young
              researchers, this is an invaluable opportunity to showcase their work, as well
              as to learn from the senior members of the audience.
