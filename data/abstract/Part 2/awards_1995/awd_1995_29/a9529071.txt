Abstract    :
              9529071  Crain    The goal of this project is to develop a new and fairly simple
               method for creating targeted point mutations in genes in mice.  Should the
              approach prove successful it would substantially  increase our ability to
              create precise modifications in targeted  genes in vivo. This would make it
              possible to carry out much more  sophisticated analyses of mammalian gene
              function and regulation,  and thus greatly enhance the study of mammalian
              genetics and  development. The experimental strategy is to promote homologous 
              recombination with targeted genes in embryos by injecting single  strand
              oligonucleotides (carrying the desired sequence change) into  pronuclei. The
              theoretical basis for this approach is that triple  stranded DNA structures
              appear to be required intermediates of  normal homologous recombination. The
              empirical basis is that it has  been shown that introduced single strand DNA
              and oligonucleotides  participate in homologous recombination in mammalian
              cells and  yeast, indicating that they probably are incorporated into the 
              putative triple strand intermediates. Also, it has been suggested  that single
              strand DNA is less likely to incorporate randomly into  host genomic DNA than
              is double strand DNA. If this is the case,  then the upper limit of the amount
              of DNA that can be introduced  without nonspecific toxicity to the embryos
              should be much higher  with single than with double strand molecules. The
              critical  question that will be tested in these experiments is whether a 
              sufficiently high number of single strand molecules can be injected  to raise
              the rate of homologous recombination with targeted genes  to a level that can
              be detected without genetic selection.  ***
