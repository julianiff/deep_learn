Abstract    :
              AST  95-29228  PI:  David Roberts         Milliarcsecond Polarization
              Measurements of Compact  Extragalactic Radio Sources         Radio astronomy at
              centimeter wavelengths is used to study  active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the
              very small scales. This is  accomplished with Very Long Baseline Polarimetry,
              by which the  linear polarization structure of compact radio sources may be 
              determined on angular scales of milliarcseconds, corresponding to  physical
              scales of light years at the distances of Active  Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This
              high angular resolution allows  changes in the structure of jets to be followed
              on moderate time  scales (a year or less), and the polarimetry reveals the
              order  and orientation of the magnetic field and allows study of the  thermal
              particle environment around the heart of AGN. By  observing at two or more
              wavelengths and using the Faraday  effect, the emission line regions of AGN can
              be mapped out and  interpreted in the framework of a model in which shock waves
               propagate in jets of highly relativistic plasma ejected from the  active
              centers of AGN. The ultimate goal is to elaborate the  mechanism that powers
              AGN, currently thought to be accretion onto  massive black holes.
