Abstract    :
              This research is developing a metapattern-based discovery loop for integrated
              data mining. Metapatterns (also known as metaqueries) are second-order,
              declarative expressions that  specify the types of patterns to be discovered
              and assist humans in focusing on more fruitful search directions. The discovery
              loop is a search engine that integrates deduction, induction, and external
              guidance from humans, as well as internal guidance of inter-component
              dependencies. Given a completely new database, the system first generates an
              initial set of the most general metapatterns based on the meta-information of
              the database, and then executes these metapatterns against the database to
              discover actual patterns. Based on the results, new metapatterns are
              dynamically generated by adding more constraints to the more plausible
              metapatterns. In this iterative process, human discovers can analyze, create,
              select, and execute metapatterns, or instruct the system to pursue metapatterns
              on its own.  This ability not only makes the process of data mining more
              efficient and productive (the more expert users can use the system for
              inspiration of better metapatterns, and the less expert users can learn how to
              perform data mining in a particular domain by observation), but also provides a
              new method for unsupervised learning of probabilistic, relation-based patterns.
