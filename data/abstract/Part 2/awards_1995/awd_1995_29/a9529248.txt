              CTS-9529248  K. R. Amarnath  Charles Byers  EPRI    ABSTRACT     
              "Electro-Separations 2020, A Workshop on Future Directions in Electrically
              Driven Separations" will bring together several scientists and engineers from
              universities, industries and government laboratories to discuss
              electro-separation technologies.  Electro-separation has been defined as "The
              use of electricity, or electromagnetic fields to produce or enhance chemical or
              physical separations."  The technologies have the potential to solve separation
              problems that are difficult by existing methods, to save substantial amounts of
              primary energy, and to perform strategic environmental separations.  The
              workshop will combine seminars by experts in electro-separations and all
              technical aspects will be open to discussion.  The research needs in this topic
              will be identified, prioritized and documented in the proceedings.  The
              experience and knowledge transfer from this workshop may catalyze research and
              development with significant impact on cost-effective electro-separations
              technology, leading to widespread use in pollution prevention or control and
              for environmentally conscious manufacturing with energy savings.
