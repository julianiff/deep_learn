Abstract    :
              9529407  Gross       The PI requests funding to purchase a physical and 
              geophysical survey system for coastal and inter-coastal  waterways.  This
              system consists of a specially designed  catamaran hull outfitted with an
              Acoustic Doppler Current  Profiler (ADCP), a CTD, a sidescan sonar,
              differential GPS  and a data logging computer.  The system will be used to 
              provide detailed data on currents, dissolved and suspended  particles and the
              geomorphology of the seabed in shallow  water environments.  Two-thirds of the
              funding required for  this system will be provided by the Georgia Research 
              Alliance.
