Abstract    :
              The velocity of seismic waves and the electrical conductivity of  the oceanic
              crust and mantle at mid-ocean ridges depend on how melt  is distributed around
              mineral grains.  The strength of the mantle  also depends how much melt is
              present, so flow of the mantle is  strongly dependent on the amount of melt. 
              The investigators want  to examine several aspects of melt distribution with
              laboratory  experiments on mantle rocks.  The experiments will determine how 
              the strength of the rocks depends on the presence of water, and  temperature,
              and strain.  They will also determine how melt is  distributed in the rocks. 
              The results of these experiments will be  applied to measurements of seismic
              wave velocities and electrical  conductivity that are being undertaken on a mid
              ocean ridge.
