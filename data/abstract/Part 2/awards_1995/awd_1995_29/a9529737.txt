Abstract    :
              9529737  Hey         This project will collect high-resolution deep-towed
              sidescan  and bathymetric data to map the detailed pattern of faults, 
              fissures, and recent volcanic eruptive sites along a section of the  East
              Pacific Rise at 30 degrees south.  CTD/nephelometer mounted on  the vehicle
              will provide precise hydrothermal plume distributions,  and tow-yo surveys will
              determine two-dimensional anomalies of  temperature, particle concentration and
              the dissolved fraction of  certain chemical species. The objective of this
              project is to  understand the structural controls on hydrothermal venting at 
              superfast spreading rates, the temporal controls on venting, and  the relative
              importance of hydrothermal venting and deep ocean  currents in forming
              far-field plumes.
