Abstract    :
              9529665  Fink    The study deals with the development of a technique which allow
              the  deduction of rates of eruption of small submarine volcanic  constructs
              from their morphology and texture. The PI will use a  combination of
              observations from submersible, data from camera and  sonar systems, along with
              laboratory simulation and theoretical  analysis of cooling and rheological
              behavior of lava flow  assemblages to arrive at a quantitative model of
              volcanic edifices.
