Abstract    :
              CDA - 9529549    Fischer, Gerhard   Arias, Ernesto  Eden, Hal      University of
              Colorado at Boulder    Shared Interaction in Support of Design, Learning, and
              Planning    Two InterSim (Interactive Simulation) stations are being developed,
              each composed of a large interactive surface and multiple 3-D interactors. 
              These systems allow us to move beyond the interaction model of single
              user/single computer--with an emphasis upon shared interaction to mediate
              social aspects of learning, design, and planning.  These paradigms integrate
              the use of physical objects--to support and encourage face-to-face interaction
              among the participants--with virtual objects--to provide computational support
              for the model underlying the simulation.  When linked across a network, these
              systems can allow the interaction with simulations and among individuals at a
              distance.    A two-phase prototyping process is being used:  First, an initial
              version utilizing front-surface projection is being developed, allowing us to
              deal with some of the software and device-controller issues and demonstrating
              the applicability of the approach. Subsequent development will utilize newer
              technology to create a back-imaged system to resolve shadowing problems.    To
              test and guide its development, applications of the technology are  underway in
              the form parallel efforts in the areas of Conflict Resolution, Decision Making
              and Planning; Learning by Design: Cross-Cultural Science Classroom Interchange;
              and Human-Centered, Intelligent Agents Supporting Communication and
              Collaboration.
