Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    1995 Engineering Education Coalitions Assessment Conference    P.I.:
              Dr. Gloria M. Rogers      Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a member of the
              Foundation Engineering Edu-  cation Coalition, proposes to organize and conduct
              a conference for assessment team   members, campus coordinators, and project
              directors of the eight Engineering Educa-  tion Coalitions. The conference will
              feature presentations by experts in the assessment   and evaluation of
              educational innovations and their impact on students.  These will be   followed
              by small-group working sessions in which participants develop strategies for  
              applying improved assessment techniques within their own Coalitions and
              educational   institutions.  Approximately 80 participants are expected.  The
              outcome of the confer-  ence will be a set of improved assessment strategies,
              which will be documented in a re-  port to be broadly distributed throughout
              the Coalitions.    This proposed activity has been encouraged by NSF staff and
              will be of significant   benedit to the Engineering Education Coalitions
              Program.
