Abstract    :
              AST 95-29242  Jane Charlton    Dwarf Galaxies and Their Formation: A Study in
              the Compact Group  Environment.    Knowledge of the numbers and properties of
              dwarf galaxies in  various environments is an essential element for devising
              the  overall scenario for galaxy formation.  The luminosity function  of dwarfs
              is determined by a synthesis of the initial density  fluctuation spectrum with
              evolutionary processes acting to create  or destroy existing galaxies.  The
              goal of this observational  program is to discover the formation mechanism for
              dwarf galaxies  and to explore the consequences for galaxy formation in
              general.  In particular this program has the following three objectives:  (1)
              To provide the most complete determination of the luminosity  function in
              compact groups, extending well into the regime of the  dwarf population; (2) To
              study the physics of star formation and  dwarf galaxy formation in the tidal
              debris of interacting giants  in compact groups; and (3) To determine the
              overall importance of  tidal dwarfs for galaxy formation.
