Abstract    :
              9529847    Fine    In this project, the PI will assist in implementing phase 2
              of ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for   Indonesian Throughflow), called ARLINDO
              Circulation (AC).  The objective is to study the   circulation and water mass
              stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a   thorough
              description of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and
              dominant mixing   processes.  AC is specifically aimed at resolving the
              throughflow transport and velocity field   across the central passages of the
              Indonesian Seas, extending hydrography to the eastern Banda   Sea.  Moorings
              are designed to measure the mean and variable current and thermohaline   
              stratification.  The PI in this award will be responsible for the sampling for
              CFC   (Chlorfluorcarbon) distributions that are used to determine the rates and
              types of Pacific water   contained in the throughflow.
