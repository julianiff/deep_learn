Abstract    :
              Abstract - Reklaitis - 9529532    This grant is to provide support for the
              travel expenses of fourteen U.S.  Academic participants to a workshop that will
              explore world-wide industry/ university/ government (IUG) research
              collaboration models in the chemical sciences and engineering.  The purpose of
              the workshop is to resent and discuss such models which are being employed
              outside the U.S., that is, in Europe, the Pacific Rim, and North America.  The
              intended result is the identification of best practices and components which
              may be appropriate for the U.S. environment.  The workshop presentation,
              discussions, and recommendations will be captured in a final report which will
              be widely disseminated in the chemical research community.    It is envisioned
              that this workshop will serve to launch a regular series of workshops which
              will continue the process of assessing innovations in IUG collaboration models.
               Research collaboration is dynamically evolving around the globe should be
              monitored to provide the U.S. chemical research community with information
              about successful and transplantable practices.        .
