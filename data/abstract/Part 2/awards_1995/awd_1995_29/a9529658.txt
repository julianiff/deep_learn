Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9529658    Principal Investigator:  Michael Lieber man and
              Allan Lichtenberg    ABSTRACT    Dynamics of R.F. Discharges for Materials
              Etching    Fundamental research on a novel in situ high-density large-area
              plasma source will be carried out.  Microwave driven and rf-inductively coupled
              plasma sources are widely used in the semiconductor and flat panel display
              industries for etching and deposition processes; moreover their use has become
              critical for VLSI circuit and thin film transistor (TFT) production. Large area
              high density sources will play an increasing role in processing as feature
              sizes shrink while wafer and TFT sizes increase. The program involves
              experiments and analytical models for a large area plasma source that is
              inductively excited by an RF traveling wave launched onto an antenna coil
              embedded within the plasma volume.  Such a source has favorable properties for
              scaling to large sizes. Plasma in the source will be generated in a rectangular
              box 71.1 cm x 61.0 cm x 20.3 cm containing a substrate holder large enough to
              study processing of silicon wafers as large as 300 mm in  diameter and flat
              panel glass substrate sizes as large as 360 mm x 465 mm.  A critical issue to
              be examined in the experiments is whether traveling wave excitation of a coil
              embedded in the plasma can generate uniform plasma over very large areas.
