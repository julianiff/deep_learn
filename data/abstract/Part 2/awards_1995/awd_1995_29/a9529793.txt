Abstract    :
              OCE-9529793  Scheirer    This award will support participation in a research
              cruise to the  southern East Pacific Rise at its site of maximum spreading 
              rate  (17  30'S).   The  project will complement a  sidescan-sonar  and  visual
               survey  with  near-bottom magnetics  and  pencil-scanning  sonar.   Data
              collected will address questions on the nature  and  rile  of  fissures 
              (stress distribution, role  in  magmatic  and  hydrothermal  plumbing)  and 
              the axial  depression  (caldera  or  graben?).  Magnetometer data will
              determine the relationship,  if  any, between high magnetization and fresh lava
              flows.
