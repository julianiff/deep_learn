Abstract    :
              ***  9529743  Patton       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a prototype automated microsatellite genotyping system for
              commercial applications.  In Phase I of this project, nine microsatellite loci
              were isolated from hyacinth macaws.  These loci were used for DNA
              fingerprinting of individual hyacinth macaws and pedigrees.  These loci were
              also found to work in six other macaw species.  In Phase II of this project,
              the system will be expanded to include six species from the other major groups
              of psittacine birds: cockatoos, Old World Parrots, and New World Parrots. 
              Using new molecular cloning methods, developed in Phase I, 6-10 microsatellite
              loci in each of the six new species will isolated and characterized.  Protocols
              will be developed for multiplex PCR(TM) reactions and analysis of multiple loci
              in a single lane of an electrophoretic gel on an automated DNA sequencer.   
              Genotype data will be linked directly from the laboratory system to a
              computerized database.  It is anticipated that at the end of Phase II, a
              complete, efficient, and cost-effective system will be available for producing
              a multilocus genotype suitable for individual identity and pedigree analysis
              for most species of psittacines.       There is a large existing market for
              genotyping services in parrots and many other species including livestock,
              pets, laboratory animals, and wild populations.  This market is expected to
              grow substantially for parrots as the Wild Bird Conservation Act is enforced
              and positive identity of legally-owned birds is required.  As modern,
              cost-effective systems, such as that to be developed in this research, become
              available it is anticipated that the market for genotyping other species will
              grow rapidly.  ***
