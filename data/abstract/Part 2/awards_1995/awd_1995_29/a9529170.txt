Abstract    :
              AST  95-29170  PI:  Roger Blandford         Astrophysical Studies of
              Gravitational Lenses, Faint  Galaxies, Active Galactic Nuclei, and Pulsars.    
                  Four subject areas are included in this proposal. The  first is
              gravitational lenses. A survey for multiply-imaged  compact radio sources is
              hoped to discover some good cases  with well-understood optical configurations
              that can measure  the Hubble constant from time delays between variations in 
              the multiple images. It is also proposed to explore the  possibility of
              measuring the masses of distant faint  galaxies through detecting their mutual
              weak distortion and  by performing imaging spectroscopy on giant arcs formed by
               rich clusters.         Distant faint galaxies are the subject of the second 
              investigation. New data from the Keck and Palomar telescopes  will be obtained
              and applied to learning the distances and  fundamental properties of these
              galaxies.    .....The third area is active galactic nuclei, with studies 
              ranging from the theoretical question of the causal behavior  of a black hole
              magnetosphere to analysis of broad  absorption and emission lines in quasars.
              New computational  capabilities allow 3-D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to 
              explore the evolution of magnetic field in a giant radio-  emitting lobe.      
               The last investigation will be the physics and  observational implications of
              a model of radio pulsar  emission that relies on cyclotron-Cerenkov maser
              action.
