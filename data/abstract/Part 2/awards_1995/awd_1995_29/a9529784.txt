                                 Understanding prey defenses is fundamental to a wide  range 
              of  ecological and evolutionary topics within marine communities.  For 
              example,  investigations  of differences  among  species  in  secondary  
              metabolites,  palatability,  and  susceptibility   to  consumers   have  
              provided   insights   into   factors   driving  specialization,    affecting   
              distribution    and     community  organization,  and  determining feeding 
              patterns  and  digestive  efficiencies.   The  proposed  research  will  focus 
              on  within-  individual  differences  and  the plasticity  of  individuals  to 
              respond to perturbations in their environments.
