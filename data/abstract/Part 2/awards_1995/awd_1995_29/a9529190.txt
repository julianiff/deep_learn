Abstract    :
              AST-9529190  Marcia Rieke  George Rieke    Nuclear Starbursts and Galaxy
              Evolution.    The processes in and around the nuclei of galaxies are among the 
              most intriguing subjects of astronomical research.  This work  will concentrate
              on the shortlived episodes of massive star  formation -- starbursts -- that can
              dominate these regions.  At  the same time the project will explore the
              possibility that star  formation plays an enabling role in feeding black holes
              in  galactic nuclei.  The components of the program include  observations of
              young starbursts, the development of an  appropriate library of infrared
              spectra of stars, attempting to  find the products of starbursts, and
              investigations of the roles  of Active Galactic Nuclei in these classes of
              galaxies.
