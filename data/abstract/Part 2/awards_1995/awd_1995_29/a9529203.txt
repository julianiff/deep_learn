Abstract    :
              Abstract  Driscoll  9529203    The objective of the proposed research is to
              quantify and model the complex chemistry and stretch effects that occur within
              a premixed flame as it undergoes a turbulent wrinkling process.  This proposal
              is a continuation of a previously NSF funded program.  The PI plans to make use
              of a variety of laser diagnostic techniques to investigate two model problems
              relevant to premixed turbulent combustion.  These unique flame experiments
              include: (1) the interaction of a flame front with an isolated vortex, and (2) 
              the flame propagation in an isotropic homogeneous turbulent flow in a long
              channel, generated by a set of fans.  The PI plans to measure profiles of
              important radical species, including CH, OH, O and H, and the stretch rates and
              vorticity along a premixed flame as it undergoes an unsteady wrinkling process.
               He also plans to obtain advanced Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) with
              complex chemistry and compare results to both the flame-vortex and the
              homogeneous turbulence experiments, and to use the results to measure
              quantities that are required by other types of models.
