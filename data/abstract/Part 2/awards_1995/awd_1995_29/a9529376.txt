Abstract    :
              9529376  Lambrecht  Many of the  condensed matter systems (and also devices made
               from materials) with applications in the mesoscopic region,  have a layered
              geometry.  This proposal consists of a plan  to calculate the electronic
              structure of these systems using  a sophisticated, efficient algorithm.  The
              computational  effort, based on a difference equation in the layer indices, 
              within the framework of the density functional theory using  muffin-tin
              orbitals, scales with the number of layers (as  opposed to the number of
              atoms).  Following calculation of  the one electron Green function for a
              mesoscopic system with  atomic level precision, one can derive the
              self-consistent  charge density, total energy, optical excitation energies  and
              transport properties.   The calculations will be carried  out for group-III
              nitrides, SiC polytypes and rare earth  based  semimetal/semiconductor layered
              structures.  %%%  The popular man-made materials, in a variety of applications 
              such as solid state lasers and magnetic memory devices, have  a layered look. 
              There is need for a calculation of their  electronic properties.  The novel
              approach to be used is  particularly efficient and allows an atomic level 
              understanding of the complex processes underlying the  optical and magnetic
              properties of these systems.
