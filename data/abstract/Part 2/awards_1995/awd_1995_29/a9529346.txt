                 Columbia University      Acquisition of a Rapid Prototyping System     
              Rapid-Prototyping (RP) machines have created an opportunity for development of
              a "3-D FAX" which can   transmit a physical object's model to another site
              where it may be reconstructed.  The initial goal is to   automate the model
              scanning process, reducing the time, cost and operator intervention needs of
              current   systems. The project also addresses system issues in
              model-acquisition, sensor-planning, and data-  compression that affect 3-D FAX;
              without the proposed RP machine this cannot proceed.  A second project   is to
              use the RP machine in prosthesis design.  A large variety of cadaver joints can
              be imaged with   stereophotogrammetry, CT, and MRI to produce model prototypes.
               These models can then be built with   RP equipment and tested experimentally
              to verify that they adapt to different individuals and produce   normal joint
              mechanics.  The goal is to take the imaging tools required to perform the tasks
              outlined above   and integrate them with RP equipment to form an efficient and
              clinically proven process.  The third project   is to create objects with
              varied surface depth to test a shape recovery method using multiple light
              sources.    The equipment allows production to specification of different
              objects with unusual surface configurations   to properly test and evaluate the
              reconstruction method.
