              University    Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory  for Research in
              Software Engineering      The proposed Empirical Software Engineering
              Laboratory supports following  research projects in software engineering.   (1)
               Modeling of Software Quality Using Artificial Neural Networks for improving
              the accuracy of software quality models by conducting case studies exploring
              neural network architectures and training algorithms.  (2) Measurement and
              Validation of Software Testability for characterizing relationships between
              testability and static software metrics, and for determining whether or not
              testability measurement can enhance software reliability prediction.   Case
              studies to address these issues empirically are used.  (3) Fuzzy Case-Based
              Reasoning for  identifying  fuzzy case-based methods for software quality
              prediction by developing prototype systems using industrial case study data.   
               These research projects are making significant contributions by  
              characterizing ways that people actually develop software by using   data on
              large systems from industrial partners which have  professional development
              organizations. The equipment includes five high performance engineering
              workstations that are significantly faster than others that are available.
              Purchased software includes measurement and modeling tools that are
              specifically applicable to the projects. Thus, the hardware and software of the
              Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory are critical to the above research
              projects.
