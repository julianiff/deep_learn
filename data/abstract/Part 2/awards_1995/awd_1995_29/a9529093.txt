Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Stang at the  
              University of Utah will investigate the chemistry of molecular squares.   The
              recent discovery of these complexes by the principal investigator   provides
              the basis for this award. In this endeavor the dynamic chemistry   as well as
              the synthesis of new models will be investigated. Molecular   squares that are
              derived from the self-assembly of organometallic and   inorganic complexes are
              unique materials. They are proposed to be useful   for general catalysis,
              chiral catalysis, molecular recognition and   electronic devices. An electron
              rich cavity of 20-30 angstroms within the   squares may provide a unique
              host-guest system for catalysis. An attempt   shall be made to incorporate a
              myriad of transition metals at the corners   of the square to provide new
              electronic and three dimensional   characteristics.  New molecular structures
              prepared by scientists often provide for new   materials and material
              properties. In addition to yielding new practical   applications, these new
              systems stimulate others to expand on the   paradigm to produce unique
              compounds and chemistry. This project results   from an initial discovery by
              the principal investigator and has gained   considerable momentum of late. It
              promises to have significant impact on   catalysis, molecular recognition, and
              ultimately nanoscale molecular   devices.
