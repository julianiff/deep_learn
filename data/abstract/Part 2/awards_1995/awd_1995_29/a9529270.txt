Abstract    :
              Dr. Ciardullo will use imaging and spectroscopy of planetary  nebulae in several
              nearby galaxies to simultaneously address  three important problems:  (1) the
              extragalactic distance scale;  (2) the nature of dark matter halos; and (3) the
              production rate  of planetary nebulae and the relation of that rate to other 
              stellar population tracers.
