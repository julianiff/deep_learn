Abstract    :
              9529824  Young  A mechanistic understanding of potential vorticity mixing  and 
              homogenization will be developed by constructing  streamfunctions that are 
              solutions of the equations of motion, and in which particle  trajectories 
              exhibit sensitive dependence on ilitial conditions. The main  objective is to 
              show that critical layer absorption of Rossby waves radiated  by meandering 
              boundary currents leads to irreversible deformation of  potential vorticity and
               the potential vorticity homogenization of the flanking  recirculating gyres. 
              Another objective of this study is to examine potential  vorticity in zonal 
              flows, and in particular the marginal stability and  potential vorticity
              evolution  during the nonlinear equilibration of unstable waves.
