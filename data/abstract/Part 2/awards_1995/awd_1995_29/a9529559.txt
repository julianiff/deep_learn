Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9529559    Mixing and Segregation mechanisms of granular materials
              in rotating containers will be investigated by using kinematic and granular
              dynamics modeling techniques.  Kinematic (or " geometrical") investigation will
              provide generic rules of  behavior in the entire volume of a container. 
              Granular dynamics simulations of slightly deformable particles will lead to
              predictions based on particle properties and micromechanical flow
              characteristics.  A wavelet methodology will be used to characterize the degree
              of mixing.  Both two-and three-dimensional flow situations will be considered. 
              Overall goals are the identification of the dominant mixing and segregation
              mechanisms in rotating drums, quantitative characterization of mixing in
              laboratory and industrial conditions, and optimization of mixing processes.   
              Because the current methods of investigation are largely empirical, the
              proposed project is expected to provide critical advances in the mathematical
              modeling and understanding of processes to relevance to chemical plants,
              pharmaceutics, metallurgy, cement and polymer industries.  ***
