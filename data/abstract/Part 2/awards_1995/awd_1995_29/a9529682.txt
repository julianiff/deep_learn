Abstract    :
              9529682  Yu  This grant will focus on synthesizing a novel  photorefractive
              polymer system which is designed to address  several crucial issues in PR
              polymeric materials, such as  low quantum yields, phase separation in the
              composite  materials and small net optical gains in fully  functionalized PR
              polymers.  This polymer system is based  upon a hybridized structure between
              functionalized  conjugated polymers and supramolecular transition metal 
              compounds.  It is expected that the ruthenium or osmium  complexes will play
              the role of electron reservoir for the  photoconduction process and the
              conjugated system will play  the role of the molecular pipe for the charge
              separation.  The elaboration and detailed physical characterizations of  these
              polymers will be studied.  %%%  This work will generate practically useful
              materials and  will add central fundamental knowledge to the synthesis of 
              functional polymers, especially those containing ionic  transitional metal
              species.  ***
