Abstract    :
              9529814  Tarduno    Preliminary data suggest that the assumption of hotspot
              fixity,  upon which plate motion is based, may be wrong. Comparison of 
              paleolatitudes of Pacific guyots with those of their presumed  hotspot source
              reveals large deviations. This award will test the  preliminary work more
              thoroughly, using recently recovered material  from the Ocean Drilling Project,
              and comparing paleomagnetic data  from carbonate sediments with those of the
              underlying basalts.
