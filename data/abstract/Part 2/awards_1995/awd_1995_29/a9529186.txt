Abstract    :
              The dissertation makes a contribution to the history of contraception by showing
              the interplay of scientific, religious, public administrative, and other groups
              in the development and dissemination of natural birth control..  The project
              will examine in particular the process whereby the current notion of the
              woman's time of evaluation was established and applied to the development of
              birth control methods, especially rhythm methods.  This study will, for the
              first time, trace the steps of the process that led from work done in European,
              Japanese, and American laboratories to its social impact.  It will take into
              account the interplay of the various agents involved  (researchers, medical
              practitioners, government, and religious authorities), showing how their
              different values (professional, moral, religious, and ideological) have
              interacted.  Further, the research takes up religious differences as they are
              reflected in national differences, between a Roman Catholic dominated state and
              one where separation of  church and state is rhetorically important but does
              not describe politics as practiced.
