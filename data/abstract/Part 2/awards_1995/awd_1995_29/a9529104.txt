Abstract    :
              SBR-9529104  Howard    This award supports international travel for five
              geomorphologists to attend the 1995 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium.  This
              year's symposium is has the theme of biogeomorphology in continental and in
              freshwater-aquatic systems.  The symposium assesses the progress made in the
              interdisciplinary area of biogeomorphology (study of the interaction of
              geomorphic, hydrological, and ecological phenomena) in the 35 years since the
              publication of the seminal article in the field.  The field has developed
              somewhat differently within and outside the United States, so that the
              participation of key foreign researchers is of great value.  Topics of the
              symposium include interactions between geomorphic and ecological processes,
              vegetation's effects on runoff, influences of animals on soil and
              sedimentation, and the effects of vegetation on geomorphic processes in a wide
              variety of climatic regimes.
