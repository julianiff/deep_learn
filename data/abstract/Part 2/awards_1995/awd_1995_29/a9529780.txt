Abstract    :
              SBR-9529780  Kwan, Mei-Po  Ohio State U.    While much research has found
              differences in the direction and length of the journey to work of men versus
              women, relatively few of these studies have made explicit, empirically based,
              causal  connection to the other travel activities of women, to the entirety of
              the time- and space- constraints of the women, or to differences among women of
              different ethnic groups.  This Research Planning Grant will support the
              specification of a multi-city research design for a survey-based study to
              investigate these contexts and differences.  The research design will include
              household surveys, data tracking and manipulation using a geographic
              information system,  and data analysis using two large, structural-equation
              models.  Through this award, a pilot survey will be conducted in metropolitan
              Columbus, Ohio.    The theoretical utility of this research should be in the
              conceptual and empirical connection of women's travel patterns to household
              context, distance perception, and ethnicity.  The practical utility lies in the
              potential for improving traffic forecasting and transport-demand-management
              models, used for any kind of infrastructural planning or pollution-control
              scenarios.
