Abstract    :
              9321623  Sowers  This award is for support to continue research on the
              concentration of methane, the isotopic composition and concentration of oxygen,
              nitrogen, argon, and total gas content of samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet
              Project Two (GISP2) ice core.  The methane concentration of air is a proxy for
              the extent of wetlands and the warm, wet climates they signify.  Methane is
              also a radiatively active gas which affects climate.  The isotopic composition
              of oxygen in air reflects relative rates of primary production in the
              terrestrial and marine environments, and humidity in productive continental
              areas.  Methane and the isotopic composition of oxygen are also constant (or
              nearly so) throughout the atmosphere at any one time.  They therefore serve as
              time stratigraphic markers for correlating Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. 
              Nitrogen and Argon isotopes indicate the extent of gravitational fractionation
              during the trapping process and allow for correction of the measured
              concentrations and isotopic compositions of these gases.  Total gas content
              reflects paleoelevation of ice sheets among other poorly understood influences.
               This work will provide information on climate and biogeochemistry during the
              last approximately 250,000 years of Earth history.  ***
