Abstract    :
              9629643  Prasad  The major objective of  this research project is the linearity
              and thermal stability characterization of the heterojunction biopolar
              transistor (HBT) for optimum performance.  Experiments are to be performed
              using several devices of different geometries and material systems to be
              provided by the industrial collaborators.  A preliminary investigation has
              resulted in the development of a large signal model of the inverted
              (collector-up) HBT for harmonic distortion analysis.  This model is to be used
              to model intermodulation distortion using different methods such as Volterra
              series method of Maas and the nonlinear integral method of Filicori. 
              Analytical and numerical methods are also proposed to be developed for the
              intermodulation distortion modelling.  Power efficiency is to be investigated
              and optimum conditions for the most efficient operation are to be determined. 
              In  particular, the maximum power that the device can carry for efficient
              operation over a range of  bias levels will be measured.  Application specific
              optimization of the HBT for linearity and thermal stability should be the
              result of this research project.  If successful, the same methods could be
              applied for the optimization of other applications.  ***
