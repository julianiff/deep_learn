Abstract    :
              Sanford   OCE-952735      An experimental study on the generation of the
              baroclinic tide over roguh    botom topography will be conducted at the
              Mendicino Escarpment, off the    Oregon coast. Its subsequent propagation and
              evolution along tidal beams    will be followed over a fortnight, and the
              fine-scale internal wave field in    abyssal waters over rough topography will
              be characterized. These    objectives will be met observationally by collecting
              velocity and density    profiles over the full water column. This research will
              also test models of    internal tide generation and alternate proposed sinks
              for internal wave    energy and will compare vertical wavenumber spectra for
              abyssal shear and    strain to the standard Garrett-Munk internal wave model.
