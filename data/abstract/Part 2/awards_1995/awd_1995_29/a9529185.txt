Abstract    :
                 This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student
              from the University of Calivornia-Irvine.  The project is to conduct
              ethnographic research among adolescents in Chuuk, Micronesia, on the topic of
              resource exchanges and teen-aged conflict.  The student will test several
              hypotheses involving the status of adolescents within their households and
              among their peers and their presence in exchange networks for resources.  This
              region has seen high rates of teen-aged suicides, and the project will test
              hypotheses relating to how and why adolescents feel marginalized in varying
              situations and how this relates to their ability to exchange various sorts of
              resources.  Methods will include a sample of three villages to be censused and
              a sub-sample of young men, young women, mothers and fathers to whom cognitive
              tests will be administered.  In addition narratives of exchange and support as
              well as event histories will be collected.  This research is important because
              it will add to the nation's expertise about this important region of the world,
              and will advance out cross-cultural understanding of the teen-aged transition
              to adulthood.  This transition is difficult in many societies, as shown by
              rates of teen suicide, and case studies such as this which shed light on the
              strengths as well as stresses involving individuals going through the
              transition will be valuable to policy makers.
