Abstract    :
              95290545  Wunsch  In  this project, the PIs will use a global inverse model 
              based  on long-line  hydrographic  data  from  the  World  Ocean  Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE) plus some other  sections that pre-date  WOCE,  to
              investigate  oceanic  budgets of heat,  fresh  water,  oxygen,  and nutrients, 
              and  the  interchange  of  these  components  with  the  atmosphere.  The model
              is based on the geostrophic inverse  method, and  can  be  updated with new
              hydrographic data,  as well  as  with other types of data such as those from 
              floats, current meters,  and altimetry.  A particular  feature of this approach
              is the ability of the  model to  quantitatively estimate uncertainties in the
              results.  Additional methods for determining the time variability  of ocean
              circulation will also be sought.  ***
