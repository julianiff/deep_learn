Abstract    :
              9529296  Kyu  This primary objective of the present project is to  elucidate
              phase equilibria and self-organization behavior of  crystallizable polymer
              blends containing rigid-rod  molecules. To account for the coupling of phase
              separation  and mesophase ordering, they have combined Flory-Huggins  theory
              for isotropic mixing and Maier-Saupe theory for  nematic ordering of binary
              nematic mixtures by taking into  consideration the two orientational order
              parameters having  two nematic-isotropic transitions.  Customarily, the effect 
              of molecular orientation has been ignored in the  conventional thermodynamic or
              kinetic theory of  crystallization of flexible homopolymers, although it has 
              been generally known that flexible molecules indeed align  among themselves
              during chain folding.  They will  incorporate the effect of chain orientation
              on the  crystallization which is missing in the current  crystallization theory
              of flexible homopolymers.  The  coupling between crystallization kinetics and
              phase  separation dynamics of rigid-rod mixtures will be  investigated by
              time-resolved scattering.  %%%  This is an important proposal that raises the
              potential for  incorporating various theoretical predictions from different 
              families of materials into a coherent picture with  particular emphasis in
              advanced polymer and blends.  ***
