Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Connecticut.  The research will test the hypothesis that the
              risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for adolescent females in
              Tanzania, Africa, is a function of power differences in their relationships
              with men.  In Tanzania the second highest number of AIDS cases occurs among
              women ages 20-24, indicating infection during adolescence. The theory of
              resource differentials predicts that women's likelihood of being abused by
              their partners is a function of the women's inability to access resources.  The
              project will test this theory by assessing the power differentials of
              adolescent females.  Both qualitative and quantitative  methods will be used in
              structured interviews, sorting tasks to assess knowledge, and focus groups.  
              This research is important because STDs are significant among adolescents and
              advances in our understanding of adolescent sexuality will be important for
              planners and policy makers designing programs to limit the spread of STDs.  The
              data from this project will also be valuable for cross-cultural studies of
              adolescent sexual behavior.
