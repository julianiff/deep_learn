Abstract    :
              9529384    O'Brien    This award is for a project to support the Atlantic
              Circulation and Climate Experiment   (ACCE), which is a component of the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).    In this project, the PIs will provide
              historical and near-real-time fields and uncertainty   estimates of sea level
              pressure, Sea Surface Temperature (SST),  and surface wind   speed, as well as
              other surface flux variabilities, with particular emphasis on the   ACCE time
              frame.  They will compare measured results with fields produced by  
              operational centers, and carry out modest numerical model experiments using
              their   surface fields to drive a Spectral Primitive Equation Model (SPEM).
