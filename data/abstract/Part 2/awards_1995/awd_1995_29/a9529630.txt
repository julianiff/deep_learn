Abstract    :
              9529630  Agosta  This proposal describes a research plan to perform research and
              development on a force magnetometer that will be useful for measuring the
              magnetization of small novel materials.  The device will be used on a silicon
              chip with MEMs technology.  The magnetometer will be useful in studying organic
              superconductors where only small single crystals are available for analysis. 
              The magnetization is a fundamental property of the materials which can be
              related to a physical theory which describes the superconducting or magnetic
              phases.  The results of this program may lead to a new class of
              superconductor/electronic devices.  ***
