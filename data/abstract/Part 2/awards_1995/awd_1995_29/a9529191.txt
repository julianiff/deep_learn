Abstract    :
              9529191  Jensen   The National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense and
              nine other Federal agencies sponsor several National conferences on the Small
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program each year.  One such conference
              will held in Salt Lake City on October 30-November 1, 1995.  The purpose of the
              conference is to introduce small high technology firms to the SBIR program and
              provide a mechanism for face-to-face interactions with government policy makers
              and program managers.  Under this grant, the Utah Engineering Experiment
              Station (UEES) will help plan and undertake the conference.  UEES will assist
              NSF in designing the conference agenda, identifying and contacting speakers,
              and identifying and contacting past and  current SBIR grantees from Utah.  UEES
              will also mail conference brochures to appropriate organizations within the
              region and will initiate press releases and other media contacts for the
              meeting.   The conference is the most important outreach activity for the SBIR
              program because it introduces the program to many smaller high technology firms
              and provides basic information on how to successfully participate in the
              program.  This grant should significantly increase both the size and
              effectiveness of the Salt Lake City meeting.
