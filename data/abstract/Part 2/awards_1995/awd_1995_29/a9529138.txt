Abstract    :
              9529138  Kotliar  This grant concerns those properties of a Fermi system that 
              are not present in the weakly interacting-clean substances  but that arise as a
              result of the strong interparticle  interaction and/or lack of translational
              invariance.  These  properties are present in experiments on metal-insulator 
              transitions.  They are also critical to our understanding of  heavy fermions,
              doped semiconductors, amorphous alloys and  high temperature superconductors. 
              Specifically, the project  consists of three parts (a) Mott transition in
              orbitally  degenerate systems, (b) a large dimension analysis of the  interplay
              between localization and interaction and (c)  Effect of quantum fluctuations in
              the melting of a vortex  lattice.  %%%  Typically, magnets are insulating (Iron
              Cobalt and Nickel  are very subtle exceptions) and superconductors are good 
              metals at high temperatures (when they are not  superconducting).   Recent
              discoveries of high temperature  superconductors show these materials to belong
              to a special  class, where the normal state of a superconductor is not a  very
              good metal and there is magnetism in similar compounds.  The puzzling
              coexistence of magnetism and dirty metallic  character and superconductivity is
              a complex and challenging  theoretical problem.  The present grant suggests a
              novel  approach to the solution of this problem and possible  understanding of
              the phenomena of  high temperature  superconductivity.  ***
