                   The 3D motion and position measurement system coupled to a high
              performance graphics workstation is   used to model, analyze and visualize the
              effects of repetitive contact on human joints.  It is part of a high  
              performance computational environment for research on human joints and problems
              caused by repetitive   strain. The motion and position measuring system
              measures and tracks the movement of light emitting   diodes mounted on a body
              with an RMS accuracy of 0.1 mm and a resolution of 0.01 mm. This system  
              enables the measurement of the kinematics of knees and for determining the
              kinematics in the hand during   typing and piano playing activities. The system
              also has a probe with light emitting diodes that enable the   establishment of
              landmarks and coordinate reference points on bones as well as mapping surface  
              geometries of the joint surfaces.  The high performance graphics permit
              real-time, interactive visualization   and querying of geometric models and
              stress/strain analyses. The potential payoffs of the research are in   clinical
              diagnostics, surgical techniques and preparation, prosthesis design.
