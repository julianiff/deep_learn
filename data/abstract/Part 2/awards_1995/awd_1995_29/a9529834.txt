Abstract    :
                    OPP   95-28349    PI:      P. SCHLOSSER      This proposal requests funds
              for collection, measurement, and interpretation of  about 200 tracer element
              (Tritium, Helium, Oxygen, CFC's) samples in the framework of the planned 1996
              Arctic Ocean submarine cruise.  The work will be focused on a broad survey of
              the upper waters in the Canadian Basin.  Results from a previous submarine
              cruise (USS PARGO, 1993) demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining high-quality
              transient tracer samples from surface stations.  The measurements will be used,
              together with hydrographic data, to (1) study the transport of shelf waters
              into the Arctic halocline, (2) derive evolution, circulation patterns, and mean
              residence times of the upper waters in the Canadian Basin, (3) delineate
              pathways and storage times of river runoff and sea-ice meltwater in the upper
              layers of the Canadian Basin, and (4) to validate Arctic Ocean circulation
              models.
