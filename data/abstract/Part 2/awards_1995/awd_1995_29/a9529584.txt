Abstract    :
              9529584    Talley    In this project PIs from Woods Hole and Scripps will carry
              out  hydrographic cruises enclosing a large portion of the North  Atlantic Sub
              Polar Gyre (SPG) between Greenland and the Azores.  The hydrography will form
              the base of a much larger study of the  circulation of the SPG, in which
              autonomous, subsurface floats  will monitor both subsurface currents and the
              upper layer  temperature and salinity structure over a two-year period.  The 
              first section will be occupied during the fall of 1996, in which  floats will
              be deployed, and currents will be monitored using  shipboard Acoustic Doppler
              Current Profilers.  The second section  will be occupied in the Spring of 1997,
              and will include a full  suite of chemical tracers to assess the effects of
              winter time  mixing.  The principal goals are to study the transformation of 
              the thick upper layer of relatively warm water over the course of  the winter,
              to describe how that transformation is embedded in  the general circulation of
              the North Atlantic Current and SPG,  and to examine the branching of eastward
              flowing subtropical  water from the North Atlantic Current into the SPG. 
              Attention  will also be paid to entrainment of upper and intermediate waters 
              into deep overflows, the recirculation of intermediate and deep  waters in the
              subpolar North Atlantic and the distribution of  decadal changes throughout the
              subpolar region by comparison with  historic data.
