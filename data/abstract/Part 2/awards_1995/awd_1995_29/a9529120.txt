Abstract    :
              AST  95-29120  PI:  J. Richard Gott, III         Topology of Large Scale
              Structure in the Universe         The topology of large scale structure (LSS)
              of the universe will be studied through quantitative analysis of a number of
              important observational samples (in particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
              the Shectman et al. deep redshift slices, and the COBE DMR Sky Maps) and by
              comparison with new, very large N-body and hydrodynamic simulations. This
              enables investigation of whether the complex large scale structure seen today
              with its large voids and great walls could have arisen from random quantum
              fluctuations in the early universe and affords an important new opportunity for
              cosmological model testing.
