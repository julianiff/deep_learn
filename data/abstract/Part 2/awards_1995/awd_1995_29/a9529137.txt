Abstract    :
                   During development, neurons (nerve cells) develop elaborate processes that
              may extend over long distances to reach highly specific local targets.  The
              mechanisms that determine such accurate pathfinding and connectivity are not
              fully known.  The fruitfly, Drosophila, has provided valuable data on such
              development, and the ease of producing genetic crosses and mutations provides
              approaches to the molecular mechanisms involved.  Ground-based studies show in
              great detail how particular motor neurons develop specific connections with
              specific muscles.  With this very detailed background from identified single
              cells, this project uses the space flight of Neurolab as a unique opportunity
              to test, by lacking normal gravity, how gravity may be a subtle cue important
              in developing such neuronal outgrowths and connections normally.  Drosophila
              has the advantages for space flight of having very low mass and needing minimal
              care, so this study can involve very large numbers of individuals to assay
              developmental variability.  Results of this study will be important for
              developmental neuroscience, and also will raise issues important for
              developmental biology in general.  Contribution to this project represents the
              NSF Biological Sciences Directorate's participation in the NASA/Interagency
              Neurolab activity on the space shuttle orbiter, which in turn is part of Decade
              of the Brain activities.
