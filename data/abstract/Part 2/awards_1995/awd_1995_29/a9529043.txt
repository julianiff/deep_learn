Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
              supporting research by Professor Duncan on gas-phase complexes of metal ions of
              the form (M+)(L)sub-x, where M is a metal such as aluminum, calcium, or
              magnesium, and L is a small molecule.  Pulsed laser vaporization techniques are
              used to produce ion complexes in a molecular beam environment.  Time-of-flight
              mass spectrometry, laser photodissociation, laser-induced fluorescence, and
              threshold ionization photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to obtain
              information about the structures, electronic state energies, vibrational
              frequencies, and dissociation energies of these species.  Ab initio
              calculations of certain systems will be carried out for comparison with
              experiment.    In the gas phase metal ions are capable of attaching to small
              molecules, forming complexes with unusual bonding and energy characteristics. 
              These are being studied in this project in spectroscopic and photochemical
              experiments in order to better understand the nature of the forces holding the
              complexes together.  The data obtained from these studies will assist in
              understanding processes involved in metal-containing plasmas, metal solutions,
              and biological metal centers.
