Abstract    :
              9529448  Zafiriou    The central objective of this project will be to study the
              kinetics  of oxidation-reduction interactions coupling the chemistry of 
              superoxide (a photochemically induced form of oxygen) and copper  and iron
              chemical speciation in sunlit marine waters. The principal  investigator will
              also test a new hypothesis which suggests that  there is oxidized and reduced
              dissolved species of these two  metals. This research should lead to important
              new insights on the  role played by photochemical reactions in influencing the 
              speciation of redox-sensitive trace metals in the upper ocean.
