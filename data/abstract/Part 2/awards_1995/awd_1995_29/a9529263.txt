Abstract    :
              Schweizer  AST-9529263    Collisions and mergers of galaxies in the past seem to
              have  played a major role in determining the shapes and dynamics of  present
              day galaxies.  A few galactic mergers are still occurring  and offer us
              valuable clues to past evolutionary processes.  Dr.  Schweizer will pursue a
              two pronged program of astronomical  observations aimed at dating ancient and
              recent merger events in  nearby galaxies and at studying the dynamics of
              ongoing mergers.
