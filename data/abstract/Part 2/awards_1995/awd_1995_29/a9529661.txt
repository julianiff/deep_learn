Abstract    :
              The project will measure public support for foreign economic assistance programs
              directed toward humanitarian concerns, contrast this support with public
              support for domestic humanitarian aid, and to build a framework modeling the
              public's foreign policy beliefs in the Post-Cold War era.  This is the first
              study to directly assess differences in public attitudes toward domestic and
              foreign assistance program. This study will move us toward a more solid
              understanding of how Americans think about foreign policy.    A
              computer-assisted telephone survey of a representative cross section of 500
              American adults will be conducted to empirically measure and test preliminary
              hypotheses.  The survey will measure a range of specific values and beliefs
              including humanitarianism, ethnocentrism, and support for cooperative
              internationalism.  * * *
