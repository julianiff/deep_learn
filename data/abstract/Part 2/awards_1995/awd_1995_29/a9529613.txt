Abstract    :
              9529613  Moore  It is well recognized that fluids play a crucial role in
              sediment  accretion, deformation, diagenesis and metamorphism at subduction 
              zones. To date, however, there has been little concentrated study  of the
              pathways and processes of fluid migration in such settings.  The present award
              will continue the analyses of three-dimensional  seismic reflection data
              acquired from the Barbados accretionary  wedge in attempt to better relate the
              processes of fluid migration  to the structure and deformation of this region.
              Specific topics  being addressed include the geometry of thrust faults and 
              backthrusts in the accreted sediment and the velocity/density  structure of the
              major thrust zone along which subduction takes  place.  ***
