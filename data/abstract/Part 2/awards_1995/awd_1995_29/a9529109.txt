              Abstract  ATM-9529109  Crowley, Thomas J.  Texas A & M University  Title:
              Comparative Study of Phanerozoic Glaciations    In order to develop a proper
              understanding of glacial periods, it  is necessary to examine in parallel all
              the well known glacial  periods in Earth history.  Because we are at different
              levels of  understanding with respect to each of the four glacial periods of 
              the last billion years, different problems have to be addressed foe  each of
              the glacial periods.  This award supports the examination  of the following
              problems: (1) Pleistocene - effect of vegetation  and aerosols on land-sea
              temperature differences during the last  glacial maximum and modeling the
              penultimate glacial maximum; (2)  Carboniferous - modeling the response to
              changes in orbital  insolation forcing to determine whether there is an abrupt 
              transition in the amount of simulated snowcover; (3) Ordovician --  modeling
              the effects of geography as the Gondwanan supercontinent  migrates across the
              paleo South Pole; and (4) late Precambrian --  coupling an ice sheet model with
              a energy balance model to  determine whether large decreases in solar
              luminosity can cause  glaciation in low latitudes.  These exercises will help
              clarify a  number of important climate questions and ultimately help lead to 
              development of an uniform theory for glacial periods in Early  history.
