Abstract    :
              9529958  KENNICUTT  Increasing public awareness of human impacts on the 
              surrounding environment have intensified the call for  appropriate monitoring
              of these effects to provide for sound  resource management decisions.  As one
              of the perceived last  pristine regions on Earth, Antarctica has attracted 
              substantial interest from the public in preserving and  protecting its innate
              values and natural resources.    The primary international mechanism for
              addressing  environmental issues in Antarctica is through the Antarctic  Treaty
              System.  In 1994, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative  Meeting  requested that
              the Scientific Committee on  Antarctic Research and the Council of Operations
              Managers of  National Antarctic Programs jointly convene technical  workshops
              to provide expert advice on the design  and  implementation of environmental
              monitoring programs.   In  response to this, an organizing committee was formed
              and two  workshops will be held; the first in Oslo, Norway and the  second in
              College Station, Texas. These international  workshops will address a wide
              range of issues related to the  development, design and implementation of a
              simple,  realistic and effective continent-wide network of monitoring  programs
              to gauge resource deterioration. To ensure the  success of the deliberations a
              broad cross-section of  experienced Antarctic practitioners (scientists, 
              technologists, national operators, and policy  makers) are  being encouraged to
              attend. This award provides partial  support for travel to both workshops and
              partial support to  support the second workshop to be held at Texas A&M 
              University.
