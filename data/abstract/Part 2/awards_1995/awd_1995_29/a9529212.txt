Abstract    :
              9529212  BROWN       As a participating agency in the Committee on Environment 
              and Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and  Technology Council
              (NSTC), the National Science Foundation is  committed to bearing its share of
              collective responsibilities.  In order to provide long-term assistance in
              overall program  direction, quality, balance, and priorities as well as special
               analyses and assistance, CENR has entered into an agreement with  the National
              Research Council's Board of Sustainable Development  (NRC/BSD).  This agreement
              is supported through a task-order  contract administered by the National
              Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA).  This interagency agreement
              transferring  funds from NSF to NOAA provides $10,000 toward NSF's $25,000  FY
              1995 contribution for support of the CENR-related activities  of the NRC/BSD. 
              (The remaining $15,000 are being handled through  a separate financial
              agreement.)       Through this transfer of funds, NSF is fulfilling its 
              responsibilities to share in the establishment of an effective  mechanism for
              the broader research community to work with CENR  agencies through the
              activities of the NRC/BSD.  These activities  will help strengthen programs at
              NSF and other federal agencies,  and they will facilitate efficient and
              effective use of  government funds.
