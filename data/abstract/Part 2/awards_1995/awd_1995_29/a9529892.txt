Abstract    :
              Many U.S. companies implement activities known as high performance process
              management, or HPPM.  Under HPPM, companies strive for extraordinary levels of
              product quality, great process efficiency, intensive process control, and very
              rapid response.  The desired effect is a dramatic increase in customer
              satisfaction and financial returns.  The agenda is augmented by improved vendor
              relations, increased employee involvement, and more rational product and
              process design.  While HPPM can deliver results, its implementation is
              difficult and failures do occur.  This project is a field study of the
              strengths and weaknesses of HPPM implementation at four companies.  The
              research will be interdisciplinary, involving both industrial and systems
              engineering expertise (including statistical analysis, process mapping, and
              control theory), and social science based organizational design and management
              of change frameworks (including organizational diagnosis and surveys, and
              anthropological field techniques).  The project engages the organizational
              partners in both design and execution of the research.  Expected results
              include an identification of generic HPPM implementation success factors and
              barriers, discovery of mismatches between current academic research on process
              management/engineering and actual industry needs, and recommendations for
              changes in how process management/engineering is taught in universities.
