Abstract    :
              95-29511  Muhleman    Dr. Muhleman will carry out a 3-year project of millimeter
               and submillimeter  wavelength observations of planetary atmospheres.  The 
              observatory for this  work will be the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) of
               the California  Institute of Technology.  The principal instrument to be  used
              will be the  OVRO 6-Element Millimeter Wavelength Array.  This work 
              constitutes a  continuation of research that the Principal Investigator 
              carried out  previously with NSF Grant AST 93-21602.    By focusing on a range
              of simple molecules (such as water,  oxygen, carbon  monoxide, and hydrogen
              cyanide) as trace species, Dr.  Muhleman will  investigate the temperature,
              pressure, winds, and chemical  structures of the  atmospheres of Venus, Mars,
              Neptune, Titan, and Io.  The  spatial resolution  of the observations will be
              one arc second.  The PI expects  to add asteroid  observations in the near
              future to the bodies to be  investigated.  ***
