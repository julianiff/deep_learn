Abstract    :
              Abstract  9529177  Rosenberg  This Project, the Polar Experiment Network for
              Upper-atmosphere Investigations (PENGUIn), supports most of the science and
              instrumentation in the Automatic Geophysical Observatory (AGO) network in
              Antarctica. The AGOs are totally autonomous observatories, requiring only
              annual service visits, which are located at strategic spots on the East
              Antarctic Plateau.  There are presently five AGOs in the field and a sixth will
              be deployed during the austral summer of 1996-97.  The science equipment is
              directed toward the study of the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.      The
              present PENGUIn instrumentation is:  DC Magnetometer; Lucent Technologies
              (formerly AT&T Bell Labs)  AC Magnetometer; Kohoku U. and the National
              Institute of Polar Research in Japan; U.  Of New Hampshire and Augsburg College
               VLF Radio Noise Receivers; Stanford U.  Imaging Riometers; U. Of Maryland 
              Auroral All-sky Imager; U. Of California, Berkeley    PENGUIn is expected to be
              a major contributor to both the International Solar Terrestrial Space Physics
              and National Space Weather Programs.  ***
