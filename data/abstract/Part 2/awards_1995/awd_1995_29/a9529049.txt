Abstract    :
              Electron magnetic resonance methods at 9 and 35 GHz will be used to investigate
              the structural features  of transition metal ions of catalytic importance
              incorporated in microporous molecular sieve oxide  surfaces in this research
              project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The 
              emphasis will be on determining the location of transition metal ions in
              framework or non-framework  sites in aluminophosphate (AlPO4) and
              silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) materials.  Spin echo modulation  spectrometry
              methods will provide information about adsorbate number, geometry, and
              orientation.  This  structural information will be related to the catalytic
              efficiency of the paramagnetic ion for probe reactions  such as olefin
              dimerization and propylene oxidation.  The behavior of Ni(I), Pd(I), and Rh(II)
              species in  AlPO4 and SAPO materials will be investigated.    In order to
              understand the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis by high surface area
              microporous oxide  materials, structural information about the active
              transition metal ion incorporated into these materials  must be obtained.  This
              research project will utilize electron paramagnetic resonance methods to obtain
               this structural information and relate it to the catalytic activity of
              catalyst materials for various probe  reactions.  The understanding of the
              mechanisms of catalytic activity is crucial to the rational design and 
              implementation of catalytic processes which underlie much of modern chemical
              industry.
