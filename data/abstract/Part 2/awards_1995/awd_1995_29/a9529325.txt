Abstract    :
              9529325  Kailath    The project has two different but related objectives.  The
              first  is the study of mixed H-2/H-inf control and estimation problems;  the
              second is to develop new software that will enable graduate  students and
              researchers to run realistic projects that will call  upon them to synthesize
              knowledge from different areas of  statistical signal processing and numerical
              analysis.    Classical H-2 methods (such as Wiener filtering and Kalman 
              filtering) require knowledge of second-order statistics of the  exogeneous
              signals and yield estimators that have best average  performance. On the other
              hand, the more recent H-inf (or so  called minimax) estimation methods require
              no statistical  knowledge of the exogeneous signals and yield conservative 
              solutions.  The major goals of this proposal are (1) to develop,  as completely
              as possible, an analytical characterization of the  solution of mixed H-2/H-inf
              problem, (2) to obtain a through  understanding of the tradeoffs between the
              average and worst-case  performances, (3) to seek recursive implementations of
              the  optimal, (4) to provide efficient numerical algorithms.  ***
