Abstract    :
              Ronald Lovett is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to develop a strategy for calculating   Third Law free
              energies of solids.  A simulation approach that converts a   solid continuously
              into an ideal gas provides the formalism for defining   the free energy of a
              metastable and transitory structure.  Analytical and   computer
              simulations-based estimates for the free energies of solid   structures using
              this definition will be used to predict the equilibrium   structure of a solid,
              determine the accessibility of equilibrium   structures, and calculate the
              rates of fundamental steps in the growth of   solid structures.  These
              techniques will also be used to estimate the   surface free energy of
              solid-solid and solid-fluid interfaces.  Properties of commercially important
              solid state materials depend on   their structure.  It is frequently the case
              that multiple solid state   structures are possible, and to know which physical
              structures can be   realized, one must be able to assign a free energy to all
              candidate   structures.  Furthermore, to know whether a particular structure
              can be   realized by transformation from a liquid or another solid structure,
              one   must also be able to assign free energies to intermediate, transitory  
              structures.  Lovett's research is directed at finding an analytical   approach
              to determining the free energies solids as well as the barriers   that separate
              various solid state structures from each other.
