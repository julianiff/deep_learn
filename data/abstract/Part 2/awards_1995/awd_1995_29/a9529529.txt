              Computer System Security Laboratory      A research laboratory in computer
              system security is supported by this grant. The projects targeted for the
              laboratory collectively address the problems of denial of service and intrusion
              detection, two problems of increasing importance as the nation becomes
              dependent on the computer communication infrastructure.  Research has
              identified several methods of attacks that can render a network unusable.
              Hardware obtained from this grant will facilitate the establishment of a
              laboratory with an isolated subnet, a network logic analyzer, and several
              UNIX-based workstations and personal computers.  In this environment, the
              researchers have full control of all components so that network traffic can be
              closely monitored, and denial of service experiments can be safely and fully
              explored.   The end goal of the collection of projects outlined in the proposal
              is to develop an insight into potential countermeasures for intrusion and
              denial of service attacks.
