Abstract    :

              Boston University      Real-Time, Multimedia and High Performance Computing in
              Distributed Systems      The requested instrumentation is to enhance and
              support a rapidly growing research group in areas of high   performance
              computing and communication, digital multimedia, and real-time systems.  The  
              instrumentation consists of a 12 x 12 ATM switch connecting nodes that serve as
              compute engines, files   servers, and video clients which provides high
              bandwidth access to the university's supercomputing   facility.      Five
              research projects will directly benefit from the requested instrumentation:   
              1.  Parallel compilers,    2.  Performance prediction of high-bandwidth
              networking environments connecting a                       heterogeneous set of
              computers and supercomputers,    3.  Efficient multi-threaded shared memory
              parallel computing on distributed systems,     4.  Information dispersal and
              retrieval protocols to provide for real-time, fault-tolerant                   
                comunication, and     5.  3D extension on deformable shape modeling for
              content-based retrieval for         video and image databases.     The
              advancement of these projects depends on emerging technology of high-bandwidth
              networking   environments connecting a heterogeneous set of computers and
              supercomputers, and the availability of a   network that delivers a guaranteed
              bandwidth and real-time graphics and video I/O capabilities.
