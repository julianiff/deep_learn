Abstract    :
              9529612  MOLLER  The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
              research  vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support 
              services to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea  to
              complete their investigations.  All of these ships use  oceanographic cable and
              wire rope as part of this research support.   Arrangements have been made for
              bulk purchases of cable and wire  rope for use be the UNOLS fleet which results
              in considerable cost  savings.    Fifteen reels of cable and four reels of wire
              rope will be  purchased.  The cable is stored until needed at the Woods Hole 
              Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the  Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography on the west coast.    Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine
              Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will  manage this project.  ***
