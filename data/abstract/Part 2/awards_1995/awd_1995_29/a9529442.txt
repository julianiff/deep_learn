              This proposal requests funding for a homogeneous workstation cluster and
              ATM-FDDI networking hardware to aid research in distributed computing and
              real-time networking. The equipment is useful for several projects, including: 
                 (1) Real-time communication in heterogeneous networks: This project develops
              techniques for guaranteeing deadlines in heterogeneous networks popular in
              mission-critical systems. Requested equipment enables experimentation with a
              network consisting of ATM and FDDI.     (2) Algorithms for distributed systems
              management: Algorithms are developed for managing performance and faults in
              distributed systems, using formal analysis and experimentation. Realistic
              assessment requires a dedicated cluster of homogeneous workstations to allow
              undisrupted testing and trend prediction.    (3) Failure recovery schemes for
              parallel applications: Design of efficient recovery schemes is necessary to
              minimize execution time in presence of failures. The requested workstations
              provide a homogeneous computing environment necessary for quantitative
              comparison of different recovery schemes.    (4) Distributed shared memory
              (DSM) system design: Requested equipment provides a workstation cluster and
              high-speed networking for development of an adaptive fault-tolerant DSM capable
              of achieving high performance
