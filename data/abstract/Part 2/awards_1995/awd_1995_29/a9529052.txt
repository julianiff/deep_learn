Abstract    :
              This project will examine the relationships between physical theories, using
              both a very technical examination of the mathematics and a more philosophic
              reflection on the implications of those mathematical relationships.  The
              purpose of this investiagtion is to reach new philosophic understandings about
              the nature of physical theories and to develop new insights into relationships
              between theories, such as reduction and explanation.  To do this the PI will
              use recent advances in the mathematics of asymptotic expansions to examine the
              properties of functions that describe physical theories as a fundamental
              parameter of the theory (say, Planck's constant) approaches a limiting value. 
              Since it is often the case that one physical theory represents the limiting
              case of another--a kind of intertheoretic reduction--this examination will
              offer new insights into the meaning of reductive relationships between
              theories.  From all this technical analysis the PI will then draw inferences
              about the nature of theories and their relationship that have general utility
              in the philosophy of science.
