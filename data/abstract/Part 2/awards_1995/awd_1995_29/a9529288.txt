Abstract    :
              9529288  Randolph  The objective of this project is to study the mechanisms by
              which  pressure affects nucleation and growth in protein crystallization 
              systems.  The goals of this research are to: (1) determine the  generality of
              the favorable rate and yield phenomena that have  been observed for a limited
              set of proteins; and (2) probe the  roles of protein and solvent physical
              properties in the  crystallization process.  ***
