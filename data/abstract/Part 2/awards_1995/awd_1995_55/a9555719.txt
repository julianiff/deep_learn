Abstract    :
              Soloway  9555719    This effort aims to provide a compelling demonstration that
              a population of high  school students, representative of the rich diversity
              served by public education, can-and indeed, will-engage, in the context of good
              authentic science problems, in the full-range of science inquiry activities, as
              advocated by the AAAS and the NRC, when they area supported by a comprehensive
              and scaffold computer and communications environment; and, in so doing, the
              students will develop a genuine understanding of science content and process.  
               In this four year project, we will construct, classroom deploy, and evaluate
              the Investigators' Workshop (IWSHop), a computationally enhanced learning
              environment that houses and integrates the many tools needed to support the
              full-range of inquiry activities, e.g., data and information gathering,
              planning & Managing, modeling and visualizing, community debating. The IWShop
              will also serve as meeting place, available on the Internet through the
              University of Michigan's Digital Library. Learner-Centered Design will be used
              in the development of the IWShop; where appropriate, 3D photo-realistic
              interfaces will be used.    The IWShop will be used on a routing, daily basis
              by students in two high schools in Ann Arbor and two in Omaha in addressing
              curriculum projects that cover a 10th grade year of integrated science. A
              multi-pronged, thorough evaluation will be carried out to assess the impact of
              the IWShop on students' understanding of and motivation toward science.  ***
