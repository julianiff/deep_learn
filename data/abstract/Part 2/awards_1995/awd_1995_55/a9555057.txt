Abstract    :
              This project is a major institutional reform by which  students at the
              University of Arizona will be able to  combine a liberal arts education with
              the problem-solving  skills emphasized in engineering programs.  The new
              program  in Engineering with Liberal and Technical Education (ELiTE)  will lead
              to a Bachelor of Arts in Engineering.  The program  should be especially
              attractive to students with ability and  interest in mathematics and science
              who seek a truly well  rounded education, as well as those who find traditional
               engineering programs too narrowly technical.  The project  will include an
              innovative seminar series that provides an  in-depth examination of the social
              context within which  engineering is carried out.  The project also plans to 
              educate leaders with a broad vision of society, integrated  with the skills of
              an engineer.  On an experimental level,  the project will attempt to
              demonstrate that it is possible  to increase student demand for engineering,
              recruit and  retain a greater percentage of women and minorities, and  attain a
              higher graduation rate by increasing the degree of  flexibility in engineering
              education.
