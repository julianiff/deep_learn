Abstract    :
              The study of ordinary differential equations is a core element  of any
              curriculum in engineering, computer science, or the  physical sciences.  This
              proposal addresses the need for  increased emphasis on computational methods in
              differential  equations education by establishing a World Wide Web server  that
              will provide materials to instructors and students.  These  materials will be
              primarily computer-based examples  illustrating analysis of physical and
              biological systems using  differential equations, and software for use in
              conjunction with  them.  Provision will be made for submissions of exercises
              for  electronic publication on the server.  The ultimate objective is  to
              provide a repository for instructional materials illustrating  computational
              approaches in the study of differential  equations.  A-1  NSF FORM 1358 (1194)
