Abstract    :
              9555734  Frierson    The Valencia BRIDGES program (Building and Replicating an
              Innovative Demonstration Model to Facilitate Gender  Equity in Science) will
              focus on activities that increase students, faculty, and counselors
              understanding of  the  relationships between gender and the study of science.
              The project will increase the academic, retention, and  completion success
              rates of female community college students enrolled in science courses, 
              develop a new  instructional approach to better prepare females for upper
              division study and careers involving scientific research,  and increase the
              percentage of female students enrolled in science courses by helping female
              students make informed  career choices and better course selection decisions. 
              Curricular changes include a new lower division research  methods course,
              enriched lower division biological and physical science courses with strategies
              and content that are  free of gender bias, mentoring opportunities for
              students, hands-on internships in research laboratories at the  University of
              Florida, scientific and equity workshops targeted at the female student
              population, new recruitment  and promotion materials to targeted students, and
              specialized counseling and mentoring interactions which focus on  personal,
              transfer, career, and financial aid issues.    Community college students are
              less likely to have research and mentoring experiences that lead to
              research-based  scientific careers.  This project will reform lower level
              science courses to be more accessible for all students and  will partner with
              the state land grant institution to prepare community college students for
              university-level science  courses.  Mentorships will act as an informal network
              to increase student success.  ***
