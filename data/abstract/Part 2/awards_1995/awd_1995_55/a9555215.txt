Abstract    :
              "Let There Be Light!"  Introductory experiments with  Electric and Magnetic
              Fields  Problem: Students in the  introductory calculus-based physics course
              have great  difficulty with the concepts of electric and magnetic  fields, 
              underlying the nature of light.  Objectives:  Develop new laboratory and
              "corridor" experiments to  illustrate  fundamental principles of
              electromagnetism, and  in this context, provide an integrated introduction to 
              electrical  measurements and instrumentation.  Methods:  Based on hundreds of
              student interviews, prepare experiments  and write accompanying materials rich
              in questions for  students. Prepare illustrative video clips.  Collaboration 
              of Miami University and Brandeis University capitalizes on  the different
              student environments to develop materials  suited for many types of
              institutions.  Significance/impact:  Active learning through hands-on
              experience gives students  real understanding of physics universally covered in
              the  introductory course.  Evaluation: by visits from external  reviewers, by
              comparing pilot sections with traditional lab  sections, and by Socratic
              questioning of individual  students.  Dissemination: Scholarly publication and 
              presentations. Workshops. Disseminable products include  written materials for
              students and faculty, plus video  clips.
