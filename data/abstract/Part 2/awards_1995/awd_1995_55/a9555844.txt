Abstract    :
              ***  9555844  Salah    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Haystack
              Observatory, will initiate a 3-week, summer commuter, Young Scholars project
              with a year-long academic year follow-up program in astronomy, physics and
              mathematics for 60 students entering grades 8 and 9. The project activities
              will apply physics and mathematics to experimental observations and studies of
              astronomical sources of radio emission; measurements of distances, velocities
              and vectors, analysis of plate motion data and studies of earthquakes; and
              investigations of the earth's atmosphere, its variations and human effects on
              the environment. The students will engage in classroom discussions, group
              activities, research and field trips. Each student will be provided an
              opportunity to work with a scientist or mathematician who will serve as a
              mentor. The Observatory's instrumentation and computers will be used in the
              gathering and analysis of data, in the electronic networking of the students
              with each other and with the Observatory staff. There will also be group
              activities throughout the year and strong interactions with the science
              teachers and other students in the class.  ***
