Abstract    :
              Faculty from Cal Poly, Weber State University, and Duke University are
              developing materials to support new course sequences that integrate mathematics
              with engineering, chemistry, and physics. These materials are intended to
              support interactive learning within a World Wide Web environment. A common
              "look and feel" will be developed for this material so as to promote its
              transportability among institutions. As the project proceeds new faculty
              developers will be recruited, and the common "protocol" is expected to enable
              their contributions to be easily integrated into the larger body of material. A
              workshop for these new developers will be held at Cal Poly in the summer of
              1997. Various publications are planned including a text packaged with a CD-ROM
              containing Web-based material.
