              Lie Theory and Continuous Symmetry in the Undergraduate  Curriculum    Project
              Summary: Although the idea of symmetry, which is embodied  formally in the
              mathematical concept of group, has been a major  driving force in mathematics
              and physics during the past century,  it is so far only meagerly represented in
              the undergraduate  curriculum. Group theory usually appears as part of a course
              in  abstract algebra, and the main groups considered are finite groups.  On the
              other hand, the main groups which affect our lives and the  structure of the
              universe are continuous groups (Lie groups). This  project begins to remedy
              this situation by creating a course which  exhibits the unifying nature of
              continuous symmetry. The course  will begin by discussing symmetries which are
              directly related to  concepts of physical space: dilations, rigid motions,
              similarities.  It will then introduce the basic concepts of linear algebra, and
               discuss geometric issues in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions, culminating in  the special
              theory of relativity. Examples and applications will be  emphasized throughout.
              The course will emphasize interactive  teaching, and will include extended
              projects with possibilities for  group activities. An important project
              component will involve  working with PIMMS, the leading mathematics and science
              education  effort in the State of Connecticut. Through this effort the project 
              will impact the pre-service teacher population. A text is planned  along with
              computer laboratory materials. The overall goal of this  work is to put
              students in touch with a major direction of  intellectual advance in
              mathematics over the past century, and to  take the ideas of mathematics
              education reform f urther into the  undergraduate curriculum. In particular,
              the proposed course will  be an attractive alternative to the usual
              sophomore-level linear  algebra course.
