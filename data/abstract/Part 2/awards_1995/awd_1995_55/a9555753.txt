Abstract    :
              9555753  Muller    The proposal seeks to implement, at 6-8 other engineering
              schools, the highly successful problem-solving teaches training model developed
              at Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College.  We propose an institute
              for the summer of 1997 to introduce engineering faculty and others to the
              Engineering Problem-Solving concepts and their applications to high school
              instruction.  Each team will include 1-2 engineering faculty members, 1-2 high
              school teachers who have participated in past workshops; other team members
              might include engineers working in industry and/or administrators from the
              engineering school who would be involved in designing and/or operations of the
              replication programs.  All tea members of each team will come from the same
              geographic area, and they will be recruited as team, with the explicit
              understanding that they are interested in and committed to replicating the
              institute (with appropriate adaptations for individual site locations and
              considerations).  The institute will not only offer experiential learning of
              the methods, but will provide an intensive focus on developing plans for
              replication, so that participants will leave with an outline of expectations
              for the team as a whole, for individual team members, and specifications for
              the technical assistance they would like from Thayer School as they proceed to
              develop their replications.    Following the institute technical assistance
              will be available to those undertaking the replications, and their progress
              will be tracked, with interventions as needed to assist the development of the
              replications.  We will establish electronic communications (listservs, web
              pages) to allow participants readily to share their progress, request
              information, ask questions, etc.  ***
