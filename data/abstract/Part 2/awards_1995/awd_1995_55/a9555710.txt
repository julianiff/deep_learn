Abstract    :
              9555710  Cristini    This project extends the PI's prior work with weather data
              in grades 4-5 to data collection and modeling of the state watershed in grades
              6-8.  Each year, seventy-five teachers from New Jersey and New York receive
              training during the summers at Ramapo and continued support throughout the
              school year.  In total, the project reaches over 90 schools in the region and
              225 teachers directly.  Another 675 teachers are involved through the
              participating teachers.    The goals of the project are to create and support
              an environment that engages teachers and students in authentic investigations
              and to support these in a "seamless blending of science, mathematics and
              technology."  The project advances inquiry in middle school grades through long
              term studies on the Passaic/Hackensack watershed, which extends through
              northern New Jersey and lower New York state.  The studies include the linkages
              between:  (1) remotely sensed images (Landsat, SPOT);  (2) student-collected
              environmental data; and (3)  historical data.  These linkages are integrated
              using a Geographical Information System that allows teachers, and subsequently
              students, to interact with the data for problem solving and prediction.    Cost
              sharing is 44%.
