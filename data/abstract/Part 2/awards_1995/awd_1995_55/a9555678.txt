Abstract    :
              9555678  Goddard    This three year project will provide enhancement activities
              for 32 teachers of psychology each summer for three years beginning in 1997.
              The purpose of the project is to increase the scientific literacy of students
              enrolled in high school psychology courses. The project will do this by
              updating and expanding the teachers' knowledge of psychological science, and by
              immersing these teachers in the use of inquiry-based student initiated projects
              as the base for improving scientific understanding.   The teachers will have an
              intensive four week session designed for them to be immersed in a small
              research activity conducted during the workshop.  Each group of eight
              participants will have two experienced teachers to assist them in their work.
              The teachers will also be involved in two three hour time blocks during the
              day.  There will be evening sessions of unreported duration.   The teachers
              will be drawn mostly  from the Appalachian Region.  It is further expected that
              most of the participants will come from the southeastern portion of Indiana,
              the southwestern portion of Ohio and the northeastern region of Kentucky. 
              Teacher are also welcome  from the states of Tennessee, West Virginia, North
              Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. The cost share represents
              29% of the award amount from the Foundation.
