              Institution:  University of Michigan    Proposal Title:  A Day 2-to-40
              Symposium:  Instruction in the Chemical Sciences    Abstract:  Goals and
              promised outcomes comprise the usual "first day lecture" in courses.  Promoting
              behavioral changes in classroom practices on days 2 through 40 (a semester) to
              actually meet these goals is more complex and often unaddressed or ignored.   
              A workshop-symposium is being organized that encourages the participants to
              learn how to explicitly articulate and connect their goals to the subject
              matter (chemistry) and to classroom practices.  Participation is encouraged
              from outside traditional chemical education communities.
