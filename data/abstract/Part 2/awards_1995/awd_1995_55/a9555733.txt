Abstract    :
              9555733  McCord        Women's Images of Science (WISE) will provide
              undergraduate girls and women with hands-on experiences in processes that
              demonstrate how scientists and engineers make images of subatomic structures of
              various materials.  The students will learn with technology as opposed to
              learning about technology in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and
              materials science imaging.  Participants will have the opportunity to construct
              accurate internal models of atomic structures using active, hands-on interfaces
              as opposed to looking at pictures or manipulating computer models.  The lab
              activities will use household and everyday objects that move the participant
              from the macro- to the micro- and finally to the subatomic size range,
              instilling confidence in her ability to measure, infer, and model these complex
              structures.  Future science teachers, middle- and high school teachers, and
              community college and university faculty will gain experience, producing
              materials for their courses and having opportunities to mentor young women and
              engage in peer dialog.        Hands-on experiences using technically
              sophisticated equipment will help students and K- 1 2 teachers learn more about
              the structure of matter.  Participants in this project will use telescopes,
              microscopes, and electron microscopes to examine household items.  Students and
              teachers will gain confidence in their ability to measure and make subatomic
              models of these everyday objects.    . . .
