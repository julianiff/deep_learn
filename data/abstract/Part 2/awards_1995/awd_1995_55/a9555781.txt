Abstract    :
              95-55781  James    During each of five years 30-middle school science teachers
              will participate in  a 3-week  research experience at one of 8 United States
              Department of Agriculture laboratory sites in Texas.  Teachers will spend the
              first two weeks of the summer and the fifth week working with a mentoring
              scientist. Between weeks two and three teachers will participate in a 2-week
              workshop integrating science and pedagogy using pedagogy as the vehicle for
              science content.. Academic year follow-up sessions are coupled to state science
              conventions or done via the Trans-Texas-Video Network. Teachers participating
              as team will be come from the Southern Plains region. Individual teachers will
              be expected to develop a mini-research project that can be done by students in
              their classroom; the objective here is to translate the research experience
              into the classroom.    A long range goal of the project is to establish Science
              Learning Resource Centers at each collaborating USDA lab site.
