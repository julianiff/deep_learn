Abstract    :
              9555807  Ash  The Chabot Observatory & Science Center (COSC) will develop an
              environmental curriculum implementation  project called FIRST: Female
              Involvement in Real Science and Technology.  This comprehensive, sequential 
              scientific initiative will be developed and produced in collaboration with
              local school districts, colleges, museums,  and professional societies. FIRST
              will involve students in grades 5 through 8, and their teachers,
              administrators,  care givers, and the families.  The participants will explore
              critical environmental issues, envisioning themselves  as effective shapers of
              their environment now and in the future.  The program will reach 60 elementary
              schools and  15 junior high/middle schools, with over 35,000 students total,
              and 1,200 teachers will receive training each year.   This project unites and
              builds upon the systemic reform begun by previous NSF-funded projects at Mills
              College  and Department of Energy-funded collaborative education programs.     
               Interactive environmental studies allow middle and high school students and
              their families to enrich their knowledge  by discussing real life science
              questions.  Teaching and learning in both formal and informal settings will
              help  teachers, students, and community members of an urban multilingual,
              multicultural population explore environmental  issues that effect their lives
              on a daily basis.  ***
