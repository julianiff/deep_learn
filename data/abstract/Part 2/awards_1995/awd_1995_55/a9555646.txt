Abstract    :
              9555646  Harpole    This national project will include 14 physics and tech prep
              teacher in the first year and 52 in each of the succeeding 3-years.  In Phase
              I, Leadership Teams (one physics teacher and one Tech pre teacher) and project
              staff will develop workshop materials for a 3-wekk workshop, Learning Through
              Manufacturing Experiences.  This will be done during a five-week program which
              includes a 3-week internship with Peavey Electronics Corporation and two week
              of materials adaptation and content reinforcement at Mississippi State
              University.  During the second, third and fourth years of the project two
              cohorts of 24 physics and tech prep teachers will participate in these
              workshops designed to equip them with knowledge and experience of the skills
              necessary for students to enter the world of manufacturing and the content
              knowledge to develop those skills.  Academic year follow-up includes site
              visits to schools of participants, Internet communication and one-day workshops
              in association with professional teachers' conferences.
