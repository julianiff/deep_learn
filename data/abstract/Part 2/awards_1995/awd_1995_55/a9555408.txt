Abstract    :
              The project is an Indiana University System effort to  restructure the ways in
              which mathematics relates to the  rest of the undergraduate curriculum.  The
              collaborating  institutions are IU-Bloomington, IUPUI/Indiana University- 
              Purdue University Indianapolis, IU-East, IU-Kokomo, IU-  Northwest, IU-South
              Bend, IU-Southeast, and IUPU-Fort Wayne.    The ultimate goal of the project is
              to create a new  framework for collaboration between mathematics departments 
              and the faculties of other disciplines, as well as a new  culture among
              undergraduates that will revitalize the  learning of mathematics and
              reinvigorate undergraduate  education.  There are three interrelated
              objectives:    1)   To create interdisciplinary courses in which students 
              learn new mathematical ideas and acquire new tools through  contextualizes
              problem solving and which involve the  cooperation of the mathematics faculty
              with other faculty  from a variety of disciplines.    2)   To change student
              attitudes toward mathematics by  developing an academic and social
              infrastructure to  encourage all students to see the relationship to other 
              subjects, the real world, and their own ambitions and goals;    3)   To change
              the academic infrastructure to make permanent  positive changes in the teaching
              and learning of mathematics  on the eight Indiana University campuses and
              beyond.
