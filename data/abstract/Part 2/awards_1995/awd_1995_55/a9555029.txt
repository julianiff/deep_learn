Abstract    :
              Milllikin  University will undertake  a cooperative venture among the three
              major science departments:  chemistry, biology and physics.  Under the umbrella
              of integrated laboratories,   three fundamental  questions will be addressed8 
              1. Can the first course for majors and non majors be unified around the theme
              of problem solving? If so,  what are the fundamental problems that these
              students should address?  2.  Is it possible to develop modular, multi- purpose
              (physics, chemistry, biology) laboratory experiences that permit students to
              work independently of a  scheduled lab course?  3. What elements must be
              present in lab experiences that will create active learning  communities?  The
              product will be a manual of lab experiences developed initially from our own
              expertise with lab  courses for majors that addresses concretely the answers to
              these questions.  A team of students and faculty from all  three science
              departments will study these questions for two summers.  The results of this
              project will be evaluated in the intervening  school year and during a summer
              conference.
