Abstract    :
              9555808  Musil    For over 20 years, efforts have been made to recruit and
              retain more women in science, math, and engineering.  It is time to move from
              climate to content.  "Women and Scientific Literacy: Building Two-Way Streets"
              will  transform the content and teaching methods of the science curriculum as
              it is taught both within traditional science  departments and within humanities
              and social science courses. Campus teams at institutions with strong women's 
              studies programs will design faculty development opportunities to teach new
              courses based on the scholarship in  gender and science. To assist faculty in
              their work, there will be a national Advisory Board serving in a  consulting 
              capacity; two national conferences on curriculum and pedagogical development; a
              newsletter filled with curricular  examples and resources; a moderated e-mail
              discussion list; and annotated bibliographies.    In order to increase science
              literacy both inside science and in non-science fields, this project will
              encourage the  development of new college courses.  New science courses will
              include more information about women and science  and women s studies courses
              will discuss more questions about how women have participated in the scientific
               enterprise. A resource book will be published to help others develop new
              courses.  ***
