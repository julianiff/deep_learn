Abstract    :
              9600023    Simon    The Mathematics Teacher Development (MTD) Project is
              designed to conduct detailed study of the development or preservice and
              inservice mathematics teachers as the develop form traditional conceptions of
              mathematics, learning, teaching, and classroom practice towards conceptions
              that are consistent with current mathematics education reform principles.  the
              Project endeavors to identify patterns of teacher development, obstacles that
              must be overcome by developing teacher, and key issues that emerge in the
              development process.  The Project also seeks evidence as to the effectiveness
              of particular teacher education practices in addressing particular problems of
              mathematics teacher education.  The analysis of data is from a cognitive and a
              social perspective and focuses on both the individual and the collective
              development of the teachers involved.    The Project employs a research
              methodology that incorporates whole-class constructivist teaching experiments
              and case studies of individual participants to study the development of the
              prospective and inservice teachers during and following a three-year
              instructional program.  Central to the MTD research effort is unique,
              extensive, and state-of- the-art teacher development program designed to
              promote in-depth development as a context for inquiry.
