Abstract    :
              9555842  Yentsch    This 3-year project will develop and pilot test a
              middle-school (6-  9) curriculum called GLACIER.  It uses on-going research in
              the  Antarctica to deliver science content in the areas of geologic 
              pronciples, glacial geology, geomorphology, geography, meteorology, 
              oceanography and environmental science.  Also included is the  requisite
              mathematics and hands-on explorations.  The curriculum  envisions students,
              assigned to the role of scientist, connecting  to on-line data bases and with
              Antarctic researchers to conduct  their investigations.  GLACIER integrates
              with, and replaces  portions of, the traditional middle-school sciences
              curriculum. A  comprehensive instructors' guide, video introduction, student 
              portfolio and World Wide Web environment will be produced.
