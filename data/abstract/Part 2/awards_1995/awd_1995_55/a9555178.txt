Abstract    :
              The project is developing a course in computer intensive statistical methods,
              with accompanying laboratories in Mathematica. Computer intensive statistical
              methods have significantly changed the practice of statistics in recent years,
              and need to be introduced in the undergraduate curriculum to bring the
              mathematics curriculum more in line with the current practice of statistics.
              The goals of the project are to develop an upper level undergraduate statistics
              course (a) whose topics are of current interest in the statistical community
              and are accessible to undergraduates, (b) which is problem-centered and uses
              real data, and (c) which promotes realistic use of the computer in the
              determination of problem solutions.  The target audience for these innovations
              is students majoring in the mathematical sciences. The project is producing a
              textbook, with accompanying laboratories.  These laboratories are designed so
              that they may also be used as supplementary topics in other courses such as
              mathematical statistics. The laboratories are also being made available
              electronically.        ??
