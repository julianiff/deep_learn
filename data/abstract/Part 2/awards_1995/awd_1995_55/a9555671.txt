Abstract    :
              9555671  Parravano    This Local Systemic change project will involve each of
              the four  districts Linden, Rahway and Readington Township Public Schools in 
              New Jersey and the North Penn School District in Pennsylvania that  entered
              into partnership with the Merck Institute (MISE) in 1993.    The progress,
              impact and effects of this partnership have been  documented by the Consortium
              for Policy Research in Education  (CPRE).  Each district is currently at a
              different stage in SMT  reform.  A 5 year project to promote effective science,
              mathematics  and technology teaching in grades K-8 is now proposed.  The target
               population is 825 teachers in 35 schools.  A professional  development program
              will have four components lead-teacher  institutes, peer teacher workshops,
              district inservice and  additional professional development opportunities.  A 
              perservice/inservice collaboration with local colleges and  universities is
              planned.  Components to engage key stakeholders in  the project;
              administrators, school board members, community  members and parents in all
              partner districts are included.  A  comprehensive evaluation of the program
              will be continued by CPRE.    Total Request $2,412,812 from NSF.  Cost Share
              $4,743,449.
