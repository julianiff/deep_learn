Abstract    :
              BEST (Basic Engineering Software for Teaching) Dynamics, the  work of faculty
              and students of the Basic Engineering  department of the University of
              Missouri--Rolla, began in  1992. The work has been favorably received by our
              students  and by engineering educators. Because of the project's  success,
              UM-Rolla has continued to support the work, and  recently, the BEST project was
              awarded funding by the  University of Missouri's Institute for Instructional 
              Development (IID). The project's goals are fourfold: (1) To  promote
              visualization of dynamics problems; (2) To promote  students' problem-solving
              skills; (3) To cultivate in  students 'expert knowledge,' that is, an
              appreciation for  and a reliance upon the foundational, unifying concepts of 
              engineering dynamics, and to be able to apply these with  confidence to
              virtually any problem; (4) To create a  revolutionary teaching/learning product
              that, instead of  being a classroom supplement, will be a catalyst for change, 
              shifting classes from a teachercentered lecture format to a  student- and
              team-centered discovery format. The most  distinctive feature of the proposed
              work is its scope. Not  just an add-on to an existing class reinforcing only a
              topic  or two, this project will produce a CD containing  essentially an entire
              engineering dynamics course. It will  contain essential theory, including short
              video segments on  key topics; sixty interesting, creative problems with 
              variable input parameters; step-by-step problem solution  procedures with the
              exact equations and numbers from  specific student-created cases; guided tours
              of interesting  cases; and assessment quizzes on both theory and problem- 
              solving, all with an easy to use, intuitive interface.  Because dynamics is a
              difficult-to-learn class taken by  nearly all engineering students, the impact
              of this project  is expected to be widespread.
