Abstract    :
              9555832  Nair  This project proposes to complete a manuscript of a "Field Guide
              to  Women in Science and Engineering."  These "Voices from the Field"  are
              personal stories of women scientists and engineers aimed at a  large and
              diverse audience of middle school and high school girls,  through undergraduate
              and graduate students, and professional  women.  The book is based on
              interviews--conducted by telephone or  in person--with these women.  In
              choosing the scientists and  engineers to be interviewed, we have tried to
              include a spectrum of  women with respect to ethnic heritage as well as types
              of career  path and achievement.  We believe that this book can provide a 
              unique resource for girls and women by conveying the real and  diverse pathways
              to and experiences in a career in science or  engineering.  The Sloan
              Foundation funded the first year of this  effort.    Attachment 1 includes six
              of the profiles completed.  Each profile  charts the woman's life as related by
              her, narrating personal and  professional aspirations, difficulties,
              milestones, and  achievements.  In addition, several of them draw lessons from
              her  life to guide young women who wish to work in science and  engineering.
