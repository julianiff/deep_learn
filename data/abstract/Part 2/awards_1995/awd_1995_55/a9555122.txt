Abstract    :
              Multimedia computer modules suitable for undergraduate chemistry lecture and
              laboratory courses are being designed.  The modules are both content and skills
              oriented, interdisciplinary and multidimensional, and take full advantage of
              the benefits of simulation, computation, and visualization.  They are being
              designed and created as tools for the teacher and for the student, and are
              primarily directed at general chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry,
              inorganic chemistry, and materials science.  Module topics will include the
              next version of IR Tutor, and applicable and important spectroscopies and
              diagnostic devices such as electronic absorption (UV-Vis) and electronic
              emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence); proton and carbon-13 nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR); atomic absorption (AA); thermal analysis; topics in
              polymer chemistry and materials science; and PCR technology.  Secondary
              objectives of the project include (1) a broadening of the chemistry curriculum
              beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries, (2) new undergraduate courses, (3)
              enhanced effectiveness of teaching assistants, (4) an expanded role for
              post-doctoral students in undergraduate education, and (5) improved performance
              by classes of students.
