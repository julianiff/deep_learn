Abstract    :
              Algebraic algorithms discovered in the last three decades,  coupled with
              inexpensive high speed computation have created  a minor revolution at the
              research level in algebraic  geometry. The new computational methods have found
              wide  application in a number of other fields (including robotics,  computer
              science, and CAD). These ideas are accessible to  undergraduates and, in fact,
              sometimes simpler to grasp than  the material in the standard abstract algebra
              course. This  project is creating materials which introduce and explore  these
              methods.  The materials can be used as the basis of a  number of useful and
              accessible first algebra courses for  students of science, mathematics and
              engineering.
