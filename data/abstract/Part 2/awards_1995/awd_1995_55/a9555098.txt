Abstract    :
              This project will produce real images of chemical and  physical changes
              occurring at the microscopic and atomic  levels.  These images, from different
              instruments (optical,  electron, and scanning probe microscopes), will be
              captured  electronically (video tapes and CD ROMs) and used in  conjunction
              with molecular modeling as instructional aids in  introductory chemistry
              courses.  The objective is to  introduce students to the relationships between
              macroscopic  changes in materials and the corresponding changes in the 
              arrangements of their atoms and molecules.  The graphic images will be combined
              with interactive  benchtop demonstrations and computer animation's to produce 
              dynamic visual instructional components (dynamic  visualization modules, DVMs)
              for introductory chemistry  courses.  The existing instrumentation and modeling
               facilities required for the project are currently in place.  Once developed
              the DVMs will be tested with approximately  4000 general chemistry students at
              Arizona State University  and the Maricopa Community College system.  Lack of
              funding  eliminated proposed faculty workshops and the participation  of
              Phoenix area high schools.  There is a goal of national  dissemination by a
              commercial publisher once the DVMs have  been tested in the local environment.
