Abstract    :
              This  project  is to develop an interactive multi-media  software  package  to 
              enhance  a student's ability to read  and  interpret  engineering construction
              drawings.  Construction drawings  convey  to  other  engineers  and  lay people
               the  designs  of  bridges,  highways  and  buildings.   They are called 
              "contract  drawings"  because  they  define  a  contract  between  the 
              architect,  the  engineer and the contractor as to how the finished project is 
              to  look,  what materials are to be used, and how it is to be  built.  The 
              goal  is  a  set of software called Civil  SEVE  (Structural  Engineering 
              Visual  Encyclopedia).   Besides  filling  the  void  created  by  the 
              elimination of reading  and  interpretation  of  engineering construction
              drawings, the software will promote  the  understanding of structural
              engineering terminology and  increase  the  a  student's three dimensional
              visualization  of  structural  systems.
