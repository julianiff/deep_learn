Abstract    :
              9555711  Todd    This proposal describes a teacher enhancement project designed
              to enhance a cohort of elementary level teachers to use a design and technology
              approach to integrate science, mathematics, and technology.  The project will
              enhance an initial 40 cadre teachers to prepare a cohort of 400 second tier
              teachers in ten schools in six states.  Teachers participating in the
              enhancement will be divided into ten teacher/leader teams.  These teams will
              provide guidance to the project's leadership in the development of design and
              technology enhancement support materials including an Implementation Resource
              Guide and videos.  These materials will be specifically designed to combine
              contemporary pedagogy with the delivery of technical content in the science,
              mathematics, and technology areas.  The teacher/leader teams will also assist
              with the delivery of two graduate level courses, provide leadership at 10
              demonstration sites, assist with community outreach seminars, and participate
              in a one week, terminal year, National Dissemination workshop.  This project
              will extend and implement the curriculum materials developed through a NSF
              funded instructional materials development project (Project UPDATE - Upgrading
              Practice through Design and Technology/Engineering Education).
