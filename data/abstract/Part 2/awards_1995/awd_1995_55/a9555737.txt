Abstract    :
              9555737  Beal    Mathematics is required for work in  most sciences, yet many
              girls  lose confidence in their ability to do math and take the course 
              requirements, thus ensuring that women will be underrepresented in  science. 
              Prior research indicates that a critical factor  contributing to girls'
              declining self confidence in their math  competence is the type of instruction
              and performance feedback  typically provided by classroom teachers.  The goal
              of this project  is to utilize the power of intelligent computer based tutoring
               systems to enhance the confidence, motivation, and skill mastery of  female
              students in elementary grades 3 - 5.  We will apply  intervention before late
              elementary school, the point at which  gender differences in attitudes towards
              math become apparent.  The  intelligent computer tutor is designed on the basis
              of research  indicating that female students benefit from and appreciate 
              pedagogy that reflects a) exploration rather than competition; b)  an interface
              and environment that includes females (versus software  based on male students'
              interests); c) the provision of confidence  enhancing feedback that sets high
              expectations, provides specific  information about how to overcome errors, and
              emphasizes  appropriate effort rather than native ability as key to math 
              success.
