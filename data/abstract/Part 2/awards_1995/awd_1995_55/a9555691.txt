Abstract    :
              9555691  Gangolli    Building on a prior planning grant, this five-year project
              aims at systemic and lasting change in the way in which mathematics is taught
              in middle and high schools in six school districts in and around Seattle
              (Washington).   As one of the initial projects funded under the guidelines for
              Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12,
              the project involves all 595 middle and high school teachers of mathematics in
              the six targeted districts.    The project's three major goals are:    1. To
              provide all middle and high school teachers with at least 132 hours of
              professional development designed to deepen their knowledge of the mathematics
              they teach, as well as to increase their understanding and appreciation of
              successful models of pedagogy, exemplary instructional materials, successful
              uses of technology, and various issues of assessment.    2. To set up a
              continuing culture of dialogue and discussion between mathematics educators at
              all levels (K-16) in the region, aimed at improving the learning environment in
              each school, with the mathematics teachers in each school acting as the team
              that spearheads change.    3. To inform parents and the community at large
              about the goals and methods of standards-based mathematics education, and help
              them to become effective partners in the enterprise of ensuring excellence in
              mathematics education.      This collaborative project is a partnership between
              the Department of Mathematics and the College of Education at the University of
              Washington, and the Bellevue, Lake Washington, Mercer Island, Northshore,
              Seattle, and Shoreline School Districts.  The 310 middle school teachers and
              285 high school teachers participating in the project will engage in academic
              year workshops and discussion sessions, summer institutes, informal working
              sessions, optional workshops for special purposes (e.g., Internet training
              session), parent and community outreach meetings, etc.  A continuing electronic
              user group will be an i mportant strategic component of the project.     
              Estimated cost-sharing of $ 407,513 is derived from the participating school
              districts and from the University of Washington, who contribute in
              approximately equal proportions.
