Abstract    :
              The PI is proposing to utilize his twelve years of experience in fiber optics
              laboratory education to perform two tasks:    1)  develop a set of two
              laboratory manuals.  These manuals will be designed to fulfill the needs of
              educators to teach fiber optics technology at the introductory or intermediate
              levels.    2)  expand our base knowledge of future needs in the technical
              skills standard in photonics.  This will enable us to include in our laboratory
              manuals experiments with brief tutorials reflective of present and future
              expectation of technical college graduates in programs such as fiber optics and
              telecommunications.    The first laboratory manual will assume no previous
              experience in fiber optics.  The intermediate manual will present some topics
              in photonics including optical switching, optical amplifiers and current
              technology in fiber optics.    The PI has lined up for this task a
              distinguished panel of experts in this field from industry and academia.  These
              experts will serve as technical consultants and will be monitored by other
              distinguished panel of experts from industry serving as an advisory board.   
              The first draft of these manuals will be reviewed by selected professionals in
              academia in schools across the courtly.  A final version will be compiled and
              made available to all for the asking.
