Abstract    :
              A series of  computer modules will be developed to simulate the physical,
              chemical, and biological processes active in Earth systems in ways not possible
              with traditional instructional methods.  These computer models not only will
              supplement classroom instruction, they will  help students visualize  dynamic
              processes that occur over geologic time, three dimensional structures,  and
              geologic phenomena  on scales  ranging from "microns to mountains".  The goals
              of this multi-media project are to develop curriculum materials that: 1) focus
              on the physical, chemical, and biological processes at work in  Earth systems,
              2) incorporate multiple learning approaches (hands-on activities, visual aids,
              three dimensional models, and simulations of systems),  and 3) contain relevant
              and integrative problem solving . These  materials will be part of an
              integrated  curriculum package in which the computer modules will enhance the
              learning process.   This project is a collaborative effort  sponsored by the
              American Geophysical Union, with field testing of the materials at the
              University of Arizona, Glendale Community College,  and other institutional
              settings.  The project  will affect  2000 liberal arts and education majors per
              year at these institutions.  A primary focus of this project will be the
              development of new instructional materials that will  provide future teachers
              with a solid knowledge base as well as an appreciation  for the conduct of
              scientific inquiry.  A CD-ROM of the  computer exercises, laboratory manual, 
              and  instructor's manual will be developed for national dissemination.
