Abstract    :
              A workshop general chemistry class is being developed that  includes
              experimental work during every meeting. Lab work is  merged with classroom
              discussion. Students working in groups  are challenged to link their
              macroscopic observations to  chemical principles. The merger of thirty-minute,
              concept-  based discovery labs with discussion and lateral development 
              material provides a unique perspective of chemistry.  In  modernizing the
              general chemistry curriculum, fewer topics  are treated and the more esoteric
              aspects of physical  chemistry that are inappropriate for freshmen are 
              eliminated.  More time is allocated to materials chemistry,  organic and
              biological chemistry, and environmental science.  The course material is
              organized into modules or case-  studies that contain material which is
              developed with the  specific aim of showing the relevance of the material to 
              problems to which the students already have been exposed.  Societal relevance
              is built into every module of the  syllabus by incorporating laboratories,
              discussion and  "lateral development" problems for each topic.
