Abstract    :
              A  two  year, team taught, well coordinated sequence  of  courses  will  be 
              designed and implemented that will integrate topics  in  linear  algebra, 
              calculus  and calculus  based  courses  in  the  typical  pre-engineering
              curriculum. The sequence will  integrate  topics  normally  covered  in
              calculus, vector  calculus,  linear  algebra,   differential  equations, 
              introductory  physics,   and  engineering  courses  such as statics, dynamics, 
              thermodynamics,  and  circuits. The transitions from the geometry and analysis 
              of  mathematics  to  the  principles of physics  to  the  engineering 
              applications  will appear seamless. Common ideas in  mathematics,  physics,  
              and  engineering  will  be  presented  with   mutually  supporting  viewpoints
              in a timely and mutually reinforcing  way.  The capabilities of calculators and
              computers will be used as  an  integral  part  of  the project to assist the
              student  in  report  writing  and  oral  presentations as well as in 
              visualizing  the  geometric and analytic interrelations and interdependences of
              the  physical  laws,  and the application of these  physical  laws  in  solving
                practical  engineering  problems.    Course   materials  suitable for
              commercial publication are anticipated.
