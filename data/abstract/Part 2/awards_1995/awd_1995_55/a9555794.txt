Abstract    :
              9555794  Merseth    The implementation of secondary school instructional
              materials is being enhanced by the production of informational and staff
              development materials.  These new materials include case studies and video
              segments related to each of the NSF supported, comprehensive secondary
              instructional materials development projects and are being produced in print,
              video and interactive formats.  These materials illuminate the salient content
              and pedagogical features of the secondary instructional materials and are
              designed for use by those involved in evaluation and selection of instructional
              materials for high schools as well as for staff developers.
