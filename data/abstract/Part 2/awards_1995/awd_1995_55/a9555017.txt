Abstract    :
              Many elementary school teachers do not feel comfortable  teaching physical
              science using inquiry-based methods and do  not have the required background to
              present science as  agender-neutral activity that relates to the every-day
              lives  of both male and female students.  This is primarily a  result of their
              university training. The work proposed here  would result in a revised
              introductory physics curriculum  for pre-service teachers, particularly those
              at institutions  employing the quarter system. The curriculum is to be 
              developed as a series of hands-on activities and  exploration/research
              projects, and will include historical  and current biographical material on
              scientists of both  sexes and a variety of racial backgrounds. The activities 
              will focus on areas, such as health and the environment,  that have been shown
              to be of concern to students,  particularly female students. Effectiveness of
              the  curriculum for both male and female students will be tested  in the
              classroom and results will be disseminated in the  literature and through
              electronic media. A final version of  the curriculum will be made available for
              general adoption  through a publisher.
