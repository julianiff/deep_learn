Abstract    :
              9555677  Radford    Project Life focuses on the rural and poor in Arkansas,
              Louisiana,  and Texas, and is a professional development program for middle 
              grades and high school teachers of life sciences, focuses on  ecology,
              environmental science, and organismal biology.  The 4-year  program is designed
              to provide 124 hours per teacher of inservice  training in science content and
              reform methodologies to a total of  192 teachers in 3 locations.  Sixty of the
              teachers and 6 interns  will receive an additional 90 hours of additional
              leadership  training to prepare them to become workshop leaders and change 
              agents.  The project strives to develop: teachers sufficiently to  enhance
              their understanding of science concepts and inquiry  pedagogical skills. 
              Teachers have strong administrative support  for systemic change, and resources
              that allow local systems to  independently continue the systemic change begun
              by the project.   The Project will purchase kit materials with which to provide
               professional development.  Equally important however, that teachers  will be
              sufficiently enhanced to transport science process skills  across various
              disciplines and concepts.    This proposal is a request to clone what the PI's
              claim is a  successful TE project.  Scientists and science educators (interns) 
              will be recruited, and paid a summer stipend, to become part of a  team - the
              members of which are classroom teachers.  The interns  will participate in
              summer workshops alongside classroom teachers.   Efforts will be made to have
              at least two teachers from each  participating school work as a team and
              collaborate on the sharing  of ideas and site based problem-solving.    The
              rationale for disseminating this project in the three targeted  states based on
              their rural similarity to the original Louisiana  site out of which outcomes
              were successful and funded by LaSIP.   The participating SSI's support this
              project.  They have not  however, offered cash.
