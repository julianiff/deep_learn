Abstract    :
              The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University is in downtown  Brooklyn and
              serves mostly commuting students who live in  the area.  Nearly all
              undergraduates are first generation  college students; 59% are of
              African-American and Hispanic  origin; and 70% are women.  Many are unprepared
              to succeed  in the sciences.  Our project is to redesign the  introductory
              level physics course taken by most of the non-  science majors, a population
              that includes a large number of  education majors who are teachers in the New
              York  Metropolitan area.  The course will utilize current  methodologies that
              support student-centered learning journal  writing, ethnography, collaborative
              learning, and study  skills.  The project will have these objectives:  1) 
              preparation  of material  for  a  student-centered, active  learning course; 
              2) preparation of faculty to teach the  course; and 3)   enhancement of
              students' academic and  personal  self-confidence as  future scientists, 
              educators,  and citizens.  The course is being developed with the 
              participation of NYC Alliance, an NSF-funded Alliance for  Minority
              Participation (CAMP) Program.  It will be  disseminated to serve as a model and
              resource for other  colleges.
