Abstract    :
              Engineering education often focuses on disseminating technical information,
              without helping students make the  connections between this information and
              both their own life experiences and the processes they will encounter in  their
              careers. This results in a lack of true understanding, excitement and
              motivation for the subject matter. Students  from non-traditional backgrounds
              and with non-traditional learning styles are particularly affected. The goals
              of this  project are to integrate exposure to chemical engineering processes
              into the curriculum, motivate students to become  actively involved in their
              education and view the world from a chemical engineering perspective, satisfy
              the variety of  learning styles of chemical engineering students, and assess
              the effectiveness of multimedia approaches in achieving  the above goals. 
              Interactive multimedia software will be developed. The software will be divided
              into three  components: Technical Content Modules, Chemical Engineering Case
              Studies, and an Encyclopedia of Chemical  Engineering Equipment. These
              components can be used together or individually in introductory chemical
              engineering  classes as well as in freshman design courses. This software will
              integrate graphics, animations, full color still images  and moving video clips
              into a multimedia package that will allow students to learn the basic concepts
              in chemical  engineering through exploration of actual situations ranging in
              scope from simple bench-scale experiments and day to  day experiences to
              chemical manufacturing plants. The effectiveness of these materials will be
              tested, and the  software will be disseminated nationally through the use of
              CD-ROMs suitable for both Macintosh and Windows  computers, and through the
              World Wide Web. In addition, it is likely that Prentice-Hall will distribute
              these materials.   N.SF Form 1295 (11/93)
