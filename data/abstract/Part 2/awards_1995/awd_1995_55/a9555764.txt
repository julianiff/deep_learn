Abstract    :
              9555764  Lopez    The Teacher-Scientist Alliance Institute is a series of
              workshops that are part of a national initiative of the American Physical
              Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers to mobilize
              interested scientists and engineers to assist local school districts as they
              implement systemic reform of elementary science education.  This series of week
              long workshops over three years will prepare scientists to become effective
              partners in the reform of elementary science education on both a
              strategic/planning and tactical/implementation level.  In addition, the
              education division of the American Physical Society will help to broker these
              scientists with school districts who need their support.  Other shorter
              workshops in this series will be supported by the Society.    Cost sharing will
              be 68% of the NSF funds.
