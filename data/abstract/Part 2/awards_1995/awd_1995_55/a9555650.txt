Abstract    :
              9555650  Smith    Title:  Technology and Invention in Elementary Schools (TIES) 
                Project Description  This proposal describes a teacher enhancement project
              designed to enhance teams of teachers to teach the integrated science and
              technology through active inquiry using the mechanism of technological
              problem-solving and invention.  The primary delivery site for the summer
              intensive workshops will be at the National Inventor's Hall of Fame (Inventure
              Place) in Akron, OH.  Thirty-two first tier teachers, representing four member
              teams from selected schools, will participate annually in the enhancement. A
              major goal of the project is to improve teachers' ability to more effectively
              encourage underrepresented students, including a cohort of Native Americans
              from New Mexico, to participate in active, technology-based scientific inquiry.
               Instruction will consist of a series of activity based units focusing on major
              inventions including the development of polymers, the electron microscope,
              electronic digital memory, air-conditioning, and biotechnology.  Participants
              will interact with noted inventors, explore the interface of science standards
              with technological inventiveness, engage in hands-on inquiry, and participate
              in on-site internships at several Fortune 500 corporations.
