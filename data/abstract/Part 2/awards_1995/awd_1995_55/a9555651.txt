Abstract    :
              9555651  Wulff    This 3-year project involves secondary school science teachers
              from New York in an innovative Science Research course.  The course provides a
              "fundamentally new way of teaching" by placing much of the responsibility on
              the student as the prime initiator of the research and for the associated
              learning.  The centerpiece of the project is an intensive 3-week summer
              workshop where well prepared science teachers study the general process whereby
              students go from a broad topic of interest to a defined research problem.  This
              is complemented by learning required skills and techniques to guide and advise
              students as they seek information, contacts with senior scientists, accessing
              information electronically and communicating the results of the research. 
              Academic year follow-up includes 6 meetings with a focus on solving problems
              and networking.  The program enrolls 20 teachers the first year, 30 the second
              and 40 the third.
