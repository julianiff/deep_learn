Abstract    :
              The focus of software engineering as we move towards the  21st Century is on
              Integrated Software Development. Large,  industrial strength, software systems
              that students are  increasingly required to work on involve systems 
              integration, interpretability, component-based software,  software
              architectures, and application frameworks. However,  if we look at the software
              engineering course contents at  universities, a number of the items listed
              above are not  covered in an integrated manner. The few that are covered  are
              dealt with in different courses, and no attempt is made  to provide integration
              of these concepts in a cohesive and  systematic manner. In this proposal, we
              focus on integrative  software development through a cohesive two course
              sequence  for sophomore and junior level CS students. There are two  main
              innovative ideas that provide the underlying foundation  for our proposal:  1. 
              Incorporation of the "Component Based  Software" development paradigm, and, 2.
              Incorporation of  "Personal Software Process (PSP) " concepts in an 
              integrated, cohesive software engineering course sequence.  This project is the
              first to evolve the state of the art of  software engineering instruction
              simultaneously along the  two most important contemporary dimensions in
              software  engineering. The PSP is particularly useful in attracting  minorities
              to this sequence of SE courses. The results of  our project will be of great
              interest to a wide audience in  U.S. Universities looking to advance their
              instructional  paradigms in the software engineering area.
