Abstract    :
              9521010  Lewis      The  utilization  of  estuarine habitats  as  nurseries  by 
              many coastal  fishes is considered to be critical to the  productivity and 
              survival of those pmpulations, yet  patterns of usage and  an understanding  of
               factors which  effect  differences  in  habitat utilization  within and  among
              estuaries by the  larvae  of  these species  are  not  well-defined.  The
              objective of  this  planning study is to  measure the physiological and
              behavioral responses of  estuarine-dependent  larval fishes (Atlantic menhaden 
              Brevoortia tyrannus  and spot Leiostomus xanthurus) to a  range  of  salinity
              regimes.   This preliminary information  will provide a basis  for designing 
              more  rigorous  experiments that  will  relate  larval growth and survival  to
              environmental fluctuations.    ***
