Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program  in support of the  
              continuing research of Dr. David Whitten at the University of Rochester.    The
              research will deal with the design, synthesis, and characterization   of
              Langmuir-Blodgett films, vesicles, and membranes bearing aggregates of  
              chromophores. The chromophores will typically be trans-stilbenes,  
              trans-azobenzenes, polypyridines and polypyrimidenes attached to  
              phospholipids, calixarenes or dendrimeric amphiphiles.  The research will  
              investigate the the effect of light on the chromophoric aggregates and   what
              influence it has on the stability and physical properties of the   films. The
              ultimate application of these materials will be   photoregulatable or optical
              films and membranes which can change their   permeability, stability, and
              ion-binding ability in a controlled manner   upon exposure to light.  The
              synthesis of optical films and membranes whose stability and physical  
              properties can be predictably controlled by light of the appropriate  
              frequency and intensity is of great interest to the organic dynamics,  
              materials and biophysics communities. Such materials are likely to find  
              applications in molecular optoelectronics,  drug-delivery systems and gas  
              separation systems.
