Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9521373    An Engineering description of multi-phase flows by
              necessity must be made on the basis of macroscopic equations in which the phase
              inhomogeneties are accounted for in an average sense, rather than in detail. 
              The difficulty in formulating the models resides in the fact that any averaging
              procedure applied to the fundamental equations of continuum mechanics leads to
              models containing more unknowns than equations.  The fundamental problem is
              then  that of closing the equation set, namely of determining "constitutive
              relations" that express some unknown quantities in terms of others.  This is
              the central theme of the proposed research for the case of disperse flows, such
              as particles in a fluid phase.    The problem will be attacked by relying on a
              new method for deriving averaged equations and on the state-of-the-art
              numerical direct-simulation techniques.  Both tools have been previously
              developed under NSF support.  The new averaging procedure expresses the unknown
              in terms of integrals over the particles surfaces that can readily be
              calculated from numerical simulations of the motion.  The computations will be
              carried out by means of a space-time finite-element method implemented on
              massively parallel supercomputers.  The insight into the structure of the
              equations that, if successful, will derive from this research promises to
              answer long-standing questions as to the mathematical structure of the
              equations and their relationship to observe phenomena.  The enhancement of the
              numerical techniques necessary to carry out this research constitutes in itself
              a significant advancement in the current direct numerical simulation
              capabilities.    This research will be carried out in conjunction with
              Professor Andres Prosperetti of the Johns Hopkins University who has a separate
              from NSF.  ***
