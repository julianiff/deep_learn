Abstract    :
              9521571  Meert    This grant provides partial funding ($12,500) for the
              acquisition  of paleomagnetic laboratory equipment at Indiana State 
              University, a primarily undergraduate institution.   A Thermal  Demagnetizer
              and Impulse Magnetizer together with peripheral  equipment will be purchased
              with these funds and an equal amount  provided by the University and will
              establish a fully functional  paleomagnetic laboratory to be guided by this
              young Principal  Investigator .  The laboratory will allow the Principal 
              Investigator to train graduate (M.A.) and undergraduate (B.A.)  students and
              involve them in a variety of projects including  Precambrian tectonics and
              paleogeographic reconstructions.    ***
