Abstract    :
              9521098  Archer       This project will generate global maps of deep-sea calcite
               burial over the last 30,000 years, using fluxes of calcite  calculated from
              230-Th accumulation.  The results combined with  models of alkalinity will be
              used to evaluate the role of deepsea  burial of calcite in the global carbon
              cycle.  ***
