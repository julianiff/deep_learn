Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  The research examines the factors that contribute to the formation of
              the Chinese scientific elite.  The study uses a comparative perspective for
              assessing applicability to the Chinese context of theories about Western
              scientific knowledge .  A variety of data are used, including biographies, mail
              surveys, interviews with scientists, and documentary and archival sources.   
              %%%   This research will contribute to the sociological understanding of
              science, Chinese society, and comparative science policies.  In addition to the
              scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
              assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
              dissertation.  It contributes to international understanding and the thorough
              training of the next generation of social scientists.
