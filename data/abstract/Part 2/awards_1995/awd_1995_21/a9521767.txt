Abstract    :
              9521767  Minschwaner     This project will be a continuation of the 18-year
              hydroxyl radical (OH) observation record at Fritz Peak, Colorado. Ground-based
              measurements of the resonant absorption of sunlight at 308 nm are performed to
              yield atmospheric OH column amounts. OH is one of the most chemically active
              constituents in the atmosphere. The photochemistry of OH is intimately
              connected to the budget of stratospheric ozone and is a major factor in the
              efficiency of ozone destruction by nitrogen and chlorine compounds.
              Measurements of OH are crucial to understanding natural and anthropogenic
              change in the Earth's atmosphere.   In addition to the continued measurements
              at Fritz Peak, a second, similar instrument will be refurbished at New Mexico
              Institute of  Mining and Technology and intercompared with the Fritz Peak as
              well as other instruments. Modeling and analysis will be carried out on the new
              data as well as the existing record in order to better understand the seasonal
              and long-term behavior of OH and its interrelationship with other changes in
              composition of the atmosphere.
