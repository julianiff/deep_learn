Abstract    :
              ***  Woodworth  9521451         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a Digital Closed-Loop Servo-valve actuator that uses a
              hydraulic motor and pump assembly, a digital valve, a manifold, and a hydraulic
              sub plate. During the Phase II project, a control algorithm will be developed
              to precisely control the position, velocity and acceleration of "loads". Phase
              I demonstrated that a high performance, all digital approach to fluid control
              was possible by developing an innovative new Digital Open-Loop Servo-valve
              using a high speed digital fluid switch. Initial prototype units consisting of
              a valve element coupled to an electronic valve driver and control element were
              constructed and tested for fast switching speeds with large quantities of
              fluid. Testing was conducted to determine the valves' directional control,
              fluid leakage, energy consumption, switching times, noise immunity, failure
              modes, pulse monitoring, and reliability and response characteristics. Results
              demonstrated system use in a wide variety of applications requiring stable,
              responsive, repeatable and/or remote control of fluid power.       The unique
              servo-valve developed during Phase II will have wide application in such
              industries as construction, machine tooling, aerospace, aircraft component
              systems, and any other areas where fluid power for improved control and
              repeatability is a performance factor.  ***  p:\sbir\yhashimi\9521451b.doc
