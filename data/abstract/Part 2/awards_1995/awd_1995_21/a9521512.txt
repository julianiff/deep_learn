Abstract    :
              9521512  Houde    This project is a five-year program to investigate variability
              in  survival and growth rates during the early lives of two species  of
              estuarine fishes in Chesapeake Bay.  Processes operating  during early life are
              hypothesized to generate recruitment  variability and the fluctuations in
              abundance that typically  occur in marine and estuarine fish stocks. 
              Objectives of the  research are to determine the temporal and spatial patterns,
              and  the scales of variability in survival and growth rates of fish  eggs and
              larvae.  The role of ontogeny and trends in stage-  specific survivorship
              during development also will be emphasized.  Two species with contrasting life
              histories, the bay anchovy  Anchoa mitchilli and the white perch Morone
              Americana, will be  studied.  Bay anchovy spawns throughout the mainstream of
              the  Chesapeake Bay, while spawning by white perch is confined to  tidal
              tributaries.  consequently, the dynamics of the two species  are dependent upon
              dispersive or retentive mechanisms,  respectively.  The dynamics properties of
              early life stages will  be investigated at local and regional scales, and will
              include  detailed examination of how features and hydrography (e.g.  fronts,
              maximum turbidity zone) affect potential for survival.  Field surveys, drifting
              mesocosms, laboratory experiments, and  individual-based modeling approaches
              all will be included.    ***
