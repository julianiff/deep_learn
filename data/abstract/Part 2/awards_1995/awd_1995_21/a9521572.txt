Abstract    :
              Dr. James T. Spencer, Chemistry Department, Syracuse University, is   supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the
              Chemistry Division for the study of the photochemistry of   main-group metal
              cage compounds. The important photochemical pathways of   borane and
              metallaborane clusters will be determined and the mechanisms   of these
              processes will be investigated. This will lead both to a   description of the
              range of phototransformations available to clusters   and to a clearer picture
              of fundamental molecular photoprocesses which   these molecules will undergo.  
              Light induced chemical transformations are of extreme importance in   several
              areas of chemistry. In this study the behavior of boron   containing cage
              molecules, when irradiated with intense light, will be   determined. This will
              lead both to the basic `photochemical` behavior of   cage type molecules and to
              advances in the preparation of new boron   containing electronic materials.
