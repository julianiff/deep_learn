Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  The research examines the social organization of homeless people who
              camp on publicly-owned lands.  It tests prior theories about the homeless,
              comparing older theories about social disaffiliation with newer ones on the
              culture of resistance.  The study builds on the co-investigator's four years of
              previous research and observations on this population by using ethnographic
              methods of data collection.  New data will come from 120 days of observations
              and 60 intensive interviews.  %%%   This research will contribute to
              sociological understanding of the lives of homeless rural residents.  It adds
              to a tradition that looks for insights into how social organizations are formed
              and operate by examining those who live unconventional lifestyles.  Findings
              may also be of help to policy-makers, concerned with programs for reducing
              homelessness.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
              research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
              completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the
              future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
              generation of social scientists.
