Abstract    :
              9521773  MATHIS   Relative to other groups of "higher" insects, the order
              Diptera, the flies, have been little studied.  This is especially unfortunate
              because the order contains many vectors of human and animal diseases, important
              crop pests, and even beneficial parasitic insects that have been effectively
              utilized in biological control of other insect pests.  This PEET award will
              train badly needed new systematic specialists in three families of Diptera, the
              Rhagionidae, Tanyderidae, and Aulacigastridae.  Training will encompass a
              postdoctoral associate and undergraduate student involvement, as well as
              training two graduate students.  Monographic treatments ranging from a family
              revision to generic and specific level revisions are predicted.  The results of
              these researches will be databased and made available electronically  in
              addition to formal publication.   The results of this research award will
              contribute to our knowledge of elements of the biodiversity of an important
              order of insects.  The award will support the training of new practicing
              systematists proficient in modern methods of systematic analysis and capable of
              conducting further research on other groups.  Results of this particular
              research have potential applicability to human health issues and agriculture as
              well as to various areas of basic biological research involving these flies in
              all their life stages, such as ecology, ecosystems research, population
              biology, etc..
