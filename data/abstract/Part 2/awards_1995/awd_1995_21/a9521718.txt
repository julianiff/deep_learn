Abstract    :
              9521718  Dordick  This conference is to cover both fundamental and applied
              aspects  associated with enzyme production, purification and  immobilization.
              The program is to include sessions devoted to  biocatalyst structure, function,
              and design, biocatalysis under  extreme environmental conditions (e.g. organic
              solvents, and high  temperatures and pressures), the importance of in vivo
              protein  synthesis for new biocatalyst production, enzymes in organic 
              synthesis, and bioreactor design for large-scale enzyme  processes.
              Participation at this conference will be  international, and include chemical
              engineers, biochemists,  microbiologists, physical and analytical chemists, and
              polymer  chemists from industry, academia, and government.  ***
