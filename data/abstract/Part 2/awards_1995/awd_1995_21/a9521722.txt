Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    9521722        This proposal is to extend thermodynamic
              optimization of components and power systems, particularly for turbine engine,
              using finite time thermodynamics; optimization will be carried out by adjusting
              pressure loss distributions and flow rate to maximize power output. The results
              could lead to improved engineering design of both components and systems.
