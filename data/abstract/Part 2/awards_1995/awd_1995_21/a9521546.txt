Abstract    :
              Commodity subsectors are social networks of human and non-human actors organized
              around a given commodity.  They are a type of vehicle for transforming a
              commodity, and social relations and nature surrounding that commodity.  This
              dissertation research is designed to improve our understanding of how a given
              subsector creates and maintains uniformity in a commodity through technical
              change.  It uses the case of the rapeseed subsector in the People's Republic of
              China (PRC) since 1949 as an example.  Each human actor in the subsector
              defines uniformity differently.  Thus, technical changes for creating
              uniformity in a commodity reveal negotiations among conflicting interests in
              and values for that commodity in a subsector.  The project follows rapeseed
              from production to consumption by using two complementary methods:  (l)
              historical studies of the subsector and (2) interviews with participants.  This
              award allows the dissertation student to undertake the documentary and field
              work research in the PRC needed to understand how the actors involved have
              negotiated the social and technical directions of rapeseed innovation.
