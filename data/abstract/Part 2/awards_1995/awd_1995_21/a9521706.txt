Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funds to the Linguistic Society of America which  will
              be disbursed to approximately five U.S. scientists, to help defray  the costs
              of their travel to Stockholm, Sweden, in August 1995, to  attend the XIII
              International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.  The  scientists to receive travel
              support will be selected from among  applicants, by established procedures on
              the basis of announced  criteria.  The Linguistic Society of America is
              administering this  travel grant as a service to the profession, without
              requesting support  for any administrative overhead costs.
