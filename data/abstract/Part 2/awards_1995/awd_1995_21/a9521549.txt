Abstract    :
              9521549  Denno    Nearly all predator-prey systems involve predator complexes
              comprised of multiple predator species.  Evidence from several systems
              demonstrates that the total impact of a predator complex can not be measured by
              summing the impacts of the individual predators.  This suggests that many
              predators are interacting with each other either synergistically, when
              predators facilitate each other's performance, or antagonistically, when
              predators interfere with each other's feeding or foraging.  The goal of this
              research is to quantify and identify the mechanism for the interactions between
              ground and foliar aphid predators across a wide range of conditions in an
              alfalfa agroecosystem.  Preliminary evidence from this agroecosystem suggests
              that foliar-foraging predators of aphids interact synergistically with
              ground-foraging predators of aphids.  Evidence from other preliminary studies
              suggests that the mechanism driving this interaction is aphid dropping behavior
              induced by foliar predators which makes the aphids more susceptible to ground
              predators.    The results of this project will have broad implications for
              basic predator-prey theory.  In addition, they will foster advances in the use
              of these predators for the biological control of insect pests.
