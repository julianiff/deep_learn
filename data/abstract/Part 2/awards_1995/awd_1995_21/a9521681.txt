Abstract    :
              9521681  Courter  MCNC requests support from NSF for connection of seven North 
              Carolina colleges to the Internet through the NC-REN regional  network.  NC-REN
              is the midlevel network located in the state of  North Carolina that will
              provide operations and network information  services. It will provide the seven
              colleges with a connection to  the Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect  most research and education organizations in the United
              States  The  colleges need the Internet connection to be able to access 
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world. The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of  the seven North
              Carolina colleges.
