Abstract    :
              9521901  Kornegay  This research program involves the characterization of
              surface and buried channel MOSFET devices fabricated in SiC - a wide bandgap
              semiconductor which shows promise for high temperature power and control
              electronics.  The program proposes to examine test patterns to extract device
              modeling parameters for surface channel SiC devices and ion-implanted SiC
              buried channel devices.  These modeling parameters will be used in modified
              simulation programs to model analog and digital circuits suitable for
              high-temperature operation.  The program emphasizes the use of
              enhancement-depletion (ED) technology in SiC and extraction of modeling
              parameters over an extended temperature range.  ***
