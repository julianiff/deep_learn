Abstract    :
                  9521588  Newell  Recent research has revealed that the fungi are
              particularly well  adapted mechanically and physiologically for decomposition
              of  dead material from vascular plants. However, data concerning the 
              accumulation of fungal mass and fungal secondary productivity is  available for
              only three small snapshots in time and only the  Georgia ocean edge.  Almost
              all of the data are for the smooth  cordgrass, Spartina alternifloria.  This
              research will obtain new  data for two predominant western Atlantic grasses, 
              S.alternifloria and Juncus roemerianus as it changes over many  seasons within
              a multi-year period.  Samples from three Atlantic  and one Gulf of Mexico
              saltmarsh will be analyzed each year  permitting determination of the
              latitudinal variation in  saltmarsh fugal productivity.  The methods used in
              measuring  fungal mass and productivity will liquid-chromatographic 
              quantification of ergosterol for mass and incorporation of  radiolabelled
              acetate into erogosterol for productivity.  This  study will lay the foundation
              for coastal mycological ecology to  be brought into the modern
              microbial-ecological era and allow the  testing of hypotheses regarding the
              impact of saltmarsh fungi on  nutrient dynamics.  ***
