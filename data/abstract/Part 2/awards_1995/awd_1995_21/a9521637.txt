Abstract    :
              Braun, Douglas  95-21637  Dr. Braun will study  Sunspot Seismology,  the only
              known way to explore subsurface magnetic fields of the sun.  He will determine
              the way that acoustic (p-mode) waves, trapped in the solar interior, interact
              with sunspots.  He will use GONG data to determine the complete p-mode
              scattering properties of a wide variety of solar active regions.  The goal is
              to identify signatures of the subsurface presence and evolution of magnetic
              regions in the p-mode scattering amplitudes and incorporate these into the
              scattering models currently available.  Thus the GONG data will be used to
              infer the physical considerations within and beneath the surface active regions
              and possibly find p-mode scattering signatures that may be used to predict such
              things as the emergence of magnetic fields.
