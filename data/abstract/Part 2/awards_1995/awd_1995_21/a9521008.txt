Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
              Professor  Gregory Gellene of the Chemistry Department of Texas Tech University
              will pursue  investigations on the symmetry- induced kinetic isotope effect, a
              new mechanism in  ion-molcule reactions.  Symmetry correlations between
              reactants and the interaction region  of the potential energy surface, based on
              nuclear conformations and isotopc substitutions,  have been fruitful in
              revealing new effects in chemical   reactions.  This research attempts  to
              provide answers to questions such as can the likelihood of a chemical reaction
              be  affected by the symmetry of the nuclear motions of the reactants, and how
              is the  macroscopic rate of a reaction modified by altering the symmetry of a
              system through  isotopic substitution.  The symmetry-induced kinetic isotope
              effect is a sofar little  recognized effect in physical chemistry.  The work
              done by Professor Gellene has  demonstrated that this effect is not only real,
              but can be quite large.    This effect appears  to play a significant role in
              the ozone chemistry of the earth's atmosphere, as well as in  laboratory
              situations.  This research will explore further this effect with the aim to
              bring  about an   improved model for chemical reaction theory.
