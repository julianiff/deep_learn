Abstract    :
              9521651  Goltz  This  project  is  funded under the Small Grants for 
              Exploratory  Research  program and involves the collection of perishable  data 
              following  the  January 17, 1995 earthquake in Kobe,  Japan.   In 
              collaboration with the Disaster Prevention Research Institute  of  Kyoto    
              University,    the    investigators    will     examine  interorganizational
              coordination of emergency response and  focus  on   response  activities 
              including  search  and  rescue,   fire  suppression and the interaction of fire
              services with  water  and  gas   utilities,  traffic  control,  damage 
              assessment,  utility  restoration,  sheltering  and mass care,  and  emergency 
              medical  assistance.  Data will be obtained through interviews,  documents  and
              surveys.  ***
