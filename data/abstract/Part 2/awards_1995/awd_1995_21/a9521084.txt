Abstract    :
              Abstract  Sivashinsky  CTS-9521084    Extension of research being currently
              carried out by the PI for NSF in the area of hydrodynamics of flame propagation
              is proposed.  The objectives of the proposed work are twofold viz. to
              investigate the interaction of local flame front dynamics with non-local
              hydrodynamic effects, and to investigate the self-fractalization and
              self-fragmentation phenomena in intrinsically unstable flames. New Models will
              be formulated in which the influence of hydrodynamic and emission factors on
              speed, shape and stability will be examined.  The PI has identified several
              specific topics relevant to these objectives which include: (1) the study of
              hydrodynamic instability involving downstream vorticity effects which should
              provide information on flame wrinkling and therefore, flame speed, (2) the
              study of pattern formation through cracks in which the structure and dynamics
              of a solitary crack will be investigated in order to determine its shape,
              propagation speed and stability, and (3) the study of self-fragmentation in
              near-limit low Lewis number diffusively unstable flames.  Attempts will be made
              to reduce the complexity of these topics to simple approximate problems
              tractable either analytically or numerically by the use of asymptotic and
              perturbation techniques.
