Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program  in the support of the  
              research of Prof. Daniel Falvey at the University of Maryland. The   research
              deals with chemical and spectroscopic studies of   nitrenium   ions,
              photochemically generated  from N-aminopyridinium salts. Two   specific areas
              will be addressed: (1) the solution reactivity of   nitrenium ions,
              particularly with nucleophiles, and (2) defining the   structural features of
              nitrenium ions which control their singlet-triplet   energy gaps.  The former
              will be probed by laser flash photolysis and   photothermal beam deflection
              calorimetry and the latter by low   temperature electron paramagnetic resonance
              spectroscopy. Experimental   studies will be complemented by semi-empirical and
              ab initio   calculations.  Nitrenium ions, as reactive intermediates in organic
              reactions,  have not   been well explored. This study of  the structural
              features which control   their singlet-triplet energy gaps, will provide
              fundamental information   which will  aid in the design of new magnetic
              materials.   Additionally,   the study  of  the reactivity of nitrenium ions
              towards nucleophiles will   shed light on their role in DNA damage and
              carcinogenesis.
