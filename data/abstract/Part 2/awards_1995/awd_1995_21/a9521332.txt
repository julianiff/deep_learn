Abstract    :
              9521332  Popp    This project will culture Antarctic diatoms under controlled 
              conditions to examine: the relationships of whole-cell 13-C to that  in
              matrices; the relationship between growth rate, CO2  concentration, and 13-C in
              whole cells and biomarkers, and the  relationship of 18-O frustules versus
              water.  The results will  serve to ground-truth the use of stable isotopes in
              diatomaceous  sediments as tracers of paleo surface water temperature and
              primary  production.
