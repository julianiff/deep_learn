Abstract    :
              9521004  Salmon  An on-going investigation of large scale ocean dynamics will be
               continued   using the planetary geostrosphic equations (PGE), a simplified set
               of   equations that omits fluid inertia, but includes the advection of 
              buoyancy.   The focus of the study will be to calculate abyssal flows over real
               bottom   topography with application to several regional models. The 
              underpinning   idea for using the planetary geostrophic equations is that 
              realistic   bathymetry is more important that higher order physics.
