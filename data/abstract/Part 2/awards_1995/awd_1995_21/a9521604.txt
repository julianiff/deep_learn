Abstract    :
              This proposal describes basic research activities to develop temporal imaging
              systems  capable of expanding of compressing the time scales of ultrafast
              optical waveforms while maintaining  the integrity of the envelope profiles. 
              The objective or the proposal is to develop temporal imaging  systems capable
              of resolving femtosecond features in optical waveforms.  Time lenses will be 
              fabricated as electro-optic phase modulators resonators will be designed for
              the modulators, new  crystals with very high electro-optic coefficients will be
              employed and very high frequency (mm wave)  sources will be used to drive the
              resonant modulators.  New state-of-the-art three dimensional  electromagnetic
              field modeling programs will be used to model the field for the complicated 
              dielectric-loaded resonators; path-integrals through the fields will be used to
              establish the peak  phase deviations to be expected.  Many applications could
              be greatly impacted by the development of  practical temporal imaging systems:
              communications, laser selective photochemistry, and investigation  of optical
              waveforms which ex ceed the capacity of currently available detection systems.
