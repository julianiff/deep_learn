              9521955  Palmer    The Manatee Community College requests support from NSF for 
              connection to the Internet through the SURAnet regional network.      SURAnet
              is the midlevel network located in the state of Florida  that will provide
              operations and information services.  It will  provide the Manatee Community
              College with a connection to the  Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect most  research and education organizations in the United
              States.    The College needs the Internet connection to be able to access 
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff, and  students of Manatee Community
              College.
