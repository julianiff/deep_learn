Abstract    :
                9521231  WAKEHAM    Degradation rate constants for several planktonic lipid
              compound  will be investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. 
              Activity of benthic animals was the most likely factor causing the  difference
              observed between rate constants in oxic and anoxic  sediments profiles measured
              in the field. Animals can alter  oxic/anoxic boundaries, control material
              transport processes,  directly or indirectly affect microbial populations, and
              directly  consume organic detritus. Differences under oxic versus anoxic 
              conditions in remineralization efficiency and formation of  intermediate
              products show that degradation follows different  pathways. Research will
              specially consider the effects on  degradation and preservation of planktonic
              lipids of grazing,  bioturbation and oscillation between oxic and anoxic
              conditions  caused by benthic animals. Radiolabelled tracers degradation rates 
              and pathways under various influences of benthic animals. Further  intensive
              study of the structure of metabolites produced during  incubation experiments
              will provide a more detailed picture of the  degradation of these important
              compounds.
