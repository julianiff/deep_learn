Abstract    :
              9521086  Verity    Non-living particulate organic matter, called detritus, plays
               an  important  role  in  the cycling of carbon and macronutrients  in  water 
              column environments, especially in the ocean.  Assessments  of  carbon bound in
              detrital particles typically exceed estimates  of  carbon from plankton and are
              second only to dissolved organic  carbon.   Detritus  is a highly dynamic
              medium which  provides  a  substrate  for microbial respiration of dissolved
              organic  carbon  and  its  transformation into particular  organic  carbon  and
               a  substrate for abiotic condensation of exopolymers, secreted  from  bacteria
               and  phytoplankton.  However, the ability  to  quantify  detritus  in  situ 
              has  remained  an  unresolved  problem.   The  proposed  research  will
              investigate variability  in  particulate  detrital  carbon  (and
              nitrogen):volume ratios  using  controlled  laboratory experiments. 
              Quantification will be conducted using a  newly  developed  fluorescent 
              labeling  technique  followed   by  imaging  cytometry.  Laboratory-derived
              data will be compared  to  field data from natural plankton communities in
              continental shelf  waters.    This  work  will  allow  accurate  determinations
                of  particulate  detrital  and  plankton  stock  sizes,  a  necessary 
              prerequisite  to  resolving the dynamic  interchange  of  organic  carbon  and 
              nitrogen  between non-living and  living  resources,  especially  the  downward
               flux  and  trophic  transfer  of  such  materials.      ***
