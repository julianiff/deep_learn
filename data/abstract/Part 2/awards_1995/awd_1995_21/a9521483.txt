Abstract    :
              9521483  Steinberg    This award will fund a short term planning visit by Dr. 
              Stanly Steinberg, University of New Mexico to Lima, Peru, to  organize a joint
              research project with Dr. Pedro C.  Espinoza, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
              Marcos.  The  research project involves the creation of new discrete  methods
              for studying nonlinear steady-state-porous-media  flow problems.  Such
              algorithms are critical to the study of  groundwater flows, contaminant
              transport and waste  remediation, problems very important to both countries. 
              The  researchers  plan to combine their knowledge and expertise  to devise
              algorithms needed for solving nonlinear elliptic  problems with discontinuous
              coefficients and subsequently  try to apply these ideas to time-dependent
              problems.    ***
