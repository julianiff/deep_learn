Abstract    :
              9521729  Das  Semiconductor quantum dots have novel optical and electronic
              properties that can lead to high speed photonic and electronic devices with
              superior performances.  For room temperature applications, it is necessary to
              restrict the dimensions of such quantum dots to below 200 A so that the energy
              separation due to quantization is greater than the thermal broadening. 
              Conventional nanofabrication techniques of using electron beam lithography and
              reactive ion techniques, where the semiconductor material is synthesized in the
              size and the shape of the nanostructure, are more appropriate for such devices.
               Current nanogrowth techniques suffer from the problem of large device size
              distribution and lack of device periodicity.  This project proposes to develop
              a novel low cost nanogrowth technology for the fabrication of periodic arrays
              of semiconductor quantum dots on silicon with good device size uniformity.  The
              technique utilizes material growth on a preformed template formed by
              electrochemical etching of aluminum on silicon. The template contains a
              periodic array of pores in which the semiconductor material is synthesized. 
              The technique is inexpensive, reliable, suitable for the fabrication of a
              variety of semiconductors, VSL compatible and has the potential for integration
              of quantum dot services with silicon integrated circuits.  The proposed
              technology is also suitable for large scale commercial production of
              semiconductor quantum dot arrays.  ***
