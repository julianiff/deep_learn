Abstract    :
              IBN-9521484  McEachron, Donald L.        Environmental light plays an important
              role in the generation of  daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. 
              However, the full  spectrum of effects of light are just beginning to be
              realized.  In  the proposed studies the effect of light and variations in light
               cyclicity on immune function will be examined.  In addition, light  is known
              to manifest many of its effects by altering the secretion  of the hormone,
              melatonin.  The ability of this important hormone  to modulate immune responses
              will also be investigated.  The  proposed studies may prove useful for
              examining the effect of light  on living organisms.  This proposal is
              appropriate for an SGER  award because of the novelty of the research area. 
              Successful  completion of this research will open new vistas in understanding 
              the interplay between the environment, brain and immune system.   The
              implications of these studies in seasonal variations in disease  prevention in
              natural ecosystems is of great significance.
