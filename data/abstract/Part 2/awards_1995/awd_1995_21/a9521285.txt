Abstract    :
              9521285  Cabrera   This project is to develop a low-cost Acoustic Doppler
              Current Profiler (ADCP) optimized for shallow water applications.  In addition
              to lower instrument cost, the new system will provide a number of significant
              advantages over existing ADCPs such as: ability to measure closer to the
              surface/bottom, more rugged transducers, lower power consumption, smaller size,
              and simpler operation and deployment.  It has demonstrated the feasibility of
              achieving these goals with the use of state-of-the-art electronics and
              application specific hardware to reduce cost, size and power consumption.  It
              has also demonstrated how new transducer design and optimized pinging schemes
              can significantly reduce sidelobe interference thus increasing the likelihood
              of accurate measurements close to the surface/bottom.  In addition,  a number
              of materials and construction techniques for transducers and underwater
              housings that can be used to improve the ruggedness of the system in areas of
              high biological activity were evaluated.  Research will continue in some of the
              areas identified.   Two complete field-worthy prototypes will be constructed
              and extensive field testing and system evaluation in cooperation with academic
              institutions will be performed.   The device will allow the relatively low cost
              measurement of currents in bodies of water to further studies in ocean
              research, nearshore erosion and bridge pillar deterioration, etc.
