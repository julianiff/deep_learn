Abstract    :
              9521058  Overpeck       This project will examine annually-stratified sediments
              from  the Cariaco Basin off Venezuela to determine variability in  upwelling
              and strength of the trade winds during the period of  rapid glacial advance and
              retreat known as the Younger Dryas  interval (8-12.6 Ka). The results will
              contribute to  understanding how tropical climate varies on short time scales, 
              and the relation of such changes to variable solar radiation.  ***
