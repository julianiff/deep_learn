Abstract    :
              9521687  DUSZYNSKI   Domestic and zoo animals as well as wild animal
              populations, including various invertebrates, can be devastated by the disease
              known as coccidiosis, which is caused by a diversity of intracellular
              intestinal parasites known collectively as the Coccidia (Protista: Apicomplexa:
              Eimeriorina).  The taxonomy of this economically important group is complicated
              and in disarray because of  complex life cycles which for many species have not
              even associated the different life stages.  Drs. Duszynski and Upton are
              recognized systematic authorities for these parasites.  They will produce a
              monographic treating the world fauna of coccidians that develops a standard of
              description and type designation and clarifies nomenclatural problems.  Results
              of their work will be made available electronically as well as in published
              form.  And they will train both graduate and undergraduate students to become
              badly needed systematic researchers with these poorly known organisms.   This
              award will contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity and relationships of
              these single celled, parasitic organisms and support the graduate education and
              training young systematists capable of further research with these organisms. 
              The project has potential to provide information relevant for management and
              control of these serious disease causing organisms as well as contributing
              knowledge of relationships of lineages important for basic research in studies
              of host coevolution, biogeography, ecology, etc..
