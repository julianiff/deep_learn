Abstract    :
              9521448  Corliss      This project will use sediment traps and short cores south
              of  Georges Bank to determine seasonal flux of organic matter and 
              corresponding changes in benthic foraminifers.  The goal is to  determine
              whether availability of phytodetritus affects taxonomic  assemblage and/or
              shell chemistry.  These variables are widely used  as indicators of deep-water
              conditions, but the controls upon them  are unknown from direct observation;
              they are based mostly upon  indirect correlations.
