Abstract    :
                OCE-9521114  Hall    The magnetic polarity reversal time scale is a building
              block of  plate tectonics.  This time scale is also valuable to other fields 
              of research, yet much of the time scale is based on indirect  methods that are
              not dated absolutely.  Absolute dates using the  40 Ar/39 Ar can now be checked
              by an independent measure of time  based on the periodic fluctuations in
              climate that are linked to  changes in the Earth's orbit.  Hall plans to
              calibrate ages of  fluctuations in the orbitally tuned time scale so that scale
              can be  extended and to precisely date significant magnetic reversals.  The  PI
              has the equipment with the precision to date minerals in ashes  so that the
              older parts of the time scale can be tied down.
