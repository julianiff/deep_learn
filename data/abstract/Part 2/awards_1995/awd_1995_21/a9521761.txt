              ATM 95-21761  ABSTRACT  SHARON NICHOLSON  FSU  TITLE:  "STUDIES OF CLIMATE
              DYNAMICS AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY  IN THE WEST AFRICAN SAHEL"    This is a three
              grant to conduct observational and modeling research on the climate processes
              over the west African Sahel region which is well known for extreme droughts. 
              Some of the specific tasks to be accomplished are 1)  Documentation of 20 year
              time series of surface parameters and rainfall over Sahel using satellite data,
              2)  Characterization of rainfall regimes, 3)  Diagnostic study of SST- rainfall
              relationships.    The successful completion of this project will help in the
              eventual understanding and prediction of west African Sahel climate.
