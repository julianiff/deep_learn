Abstract    :
              Abstract  M.Gad-el-Hak  Notre Dame  CTS-9521612    The proposed research seeks
              to explore the feasibility of a pumping technique that would be applicable at
              small Reynolds numbers.  This regime is of particular importance in
              microelectromechanical devices.  Such devices are increasingly being considered
              for a range of applications.  The mechanics for this pump is based upon the
              rotation of a non-circular cylinder placed asymmetrically in a duct.  Under the
              SGER, the PI will undertake a series of computers to test the viability of the
              technique, which has been indicated by some of the PI's earlier work.
