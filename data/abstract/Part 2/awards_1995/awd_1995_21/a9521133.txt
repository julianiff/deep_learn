Abstract    :
              9521133    Boyd  In this project, the PI will continue his long and productive 
              studies of geophysical waves and algorithms, and extend his work  on spectral
              methods, nonlinear theory, and other topics in  geophysical fluid dynamics. 
              Emphasis during the next several  years will include spectral elements and
              weakly nonlocal solitary  waves, with particular focus on coastal modeling
              using the  spectral element approach which is particularly well-suited to 
              massively parallel computers, allowing higher resolution and  faster
              turn-around of model runs.  ***
