Abstract    :
              9521474  Warner    In this project the principal investigator will measure 
              distributions of dissolved Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as part of an  Australian
              expedition along the continental shelf and slope region  of Antarctica between
              80 degrees East and 165 degrees East.  The  cruise, on the Australian vessel
              Aurora Australis, consists of  eight transects of the shelf/slope region
              between 63 degrees South  and the Antarctic coast, a region which is a
              significant source of  bottom waters to the Antarctic Bottom Water complex. 
              Several  important goals of this project include studies of the formation  and
              circulation of deep water off of Adelie Land, the pathways of  Ross Sea Bottom
              Water flow, and the interaction of slope water with  Circumpolar Deep Water.
