Abstract    :
              9521701  Bingham    This proposal is to study the current systems, water
              properties,  and time and space variability north of the Hawaiian Ridge.  These
               studies are aimed to understand the dynamics of the Ridge and how  it fits
              into, and modify the subtropical gyre.  Results on how the  Hawaiian Ridge
              affects the large scale circulation will let us  understand how typical is the
              variability observed at the HOT  (Hawaiian Ocean Time series) site and how
              representative it is of  the variability of the gyre.  The study will be based
              on the  analysis of all available data in the area.
