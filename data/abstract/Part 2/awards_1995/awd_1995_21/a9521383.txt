Abstract    :
                  9521383  Nielson-Gammon     This award supports investigations of the
              dynamics of upper atmospheric troughs or short waves.  These troughs trigger
              most extratropical cyclogenesis, but the source for these short waves is not
              well understood.  The primary objectives are to determine the typical
              mechanism(s) of formation of upper-level mobile troughs, to understand the
              nature of the interaction between these troughs and high terrain, to explore
              the role of extratropical cyclones in creating a distribution of potential
              vorticity that is conducive to the growth and propagation of short-waves and
              the effect of such fields on the cyclone development.  The principal
              investigator will employ a diagnostic technique known as piecewise potential
              vorticity inversion.     Advances in the understanding of upper-level troughs
              and their role in extratropical cyclogenesis would be of considerable benefit
              to the improvement of weather forecasting and climate simulations.  ***
