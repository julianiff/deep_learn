Abstract    :
              Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center  (SPMC) is
              strategically located, providing direct acces from  the mainland to a wide
              variety of marine and estuarine  habitats that support a rich and diverse
              marine biota.  The  location and facilities provide distinctive opportunities 
              for process-oriented research on productivity of coastal  watersheds and
              wetlands, nutrient cycling and regeneration,  microbial ecology, and benthic
              metabolism and on life  history phenomena of local fish, inverterbrates, and 
              macrophytes.   To promote research and training in these  topics, SPMC has
              developed a database and has established  three model study sites to support
              long-term research.  Recent facilities development has emphasized the
              analytical  base.  Analysis of SPMC's field support facilities has  revealed
              fundamental weakness in research vessel capacity  and in the ability to support
              SCUBA.  Such weakness is  restricting research and, if not addressed, will
              limit  SPMC's capacity to respond to growing interest in use of its  facilities
              by students and scientists.  This project will  support the purchase of a 22'
              shallow draft research vessel  that will permit access to very shallow areas
              that typify  our model study sites.  Additionally, the project will  support
              the purchase of a dive support vessel and renovation  of space to provide a
              dive locker and compressor.
