              The Semantics and Pragmatics of Natural Language in A  Computational Model for
              Representation and Inference    This research planning grant is to develop a
              knowledge  representation system closely resembling computational, 
              algorithmic, representational and inferential characteristics of  natural
              language, starting with a Boolean algebra approach.  It  is planned to
              demonstrate that only combining semantic and  pragmatic processing, logical,
              context-independent, and  nonlogical, context-dependent reasoning in natural
              language  allows one to fully simulate human understanding of natural  language
              and write programs that correctly derive, represent, and  reason with the
              information from natural language texts.  Further, it is planned to demonstrate
              the attractiveness of the  proposed framework by applying it to computing some
              pragmatic  aspects of natural language, all extremely common and all having  to
              do with the way knowledge is communicated and acquired by  natural language. 
              The objective of the project is to produce a  research proposal for continued
              research in this area.
