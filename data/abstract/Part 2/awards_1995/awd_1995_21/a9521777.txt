Abstract    :
              Korzennik, Sylvain  95-21777    Dr. Korzennik will analyze and interpret solar
              data   from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) in   order to advance
              our understanding of the causes of   the 11-year cycle of sunspots and solar
              magnetic   activity.  Decades of study of magnetic activity   strongly suggest
              that the activity cycle is somehow   caused by a dynamo process involving the
              interaction   of rotation and convection in the interior.    Unfortunately,
              detailed understanding of this process   is frustrated by our inability to
              measure the rotation   or convective flows deep within the Sun.  Helioseismic  
              data from the GONG will permit the study of rotational   and convective flows
              at and beneath the solar surface,   with velocity precision and spatial
              resolution   sufficient to test theoretical models of solar   magnetic field
              generation.
