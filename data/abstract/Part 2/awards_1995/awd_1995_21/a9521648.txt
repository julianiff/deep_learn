Abstract    :
              9521648  Johnson  This research involves taxonomic study of several genera in
              the Scelionidae, a large group of parasitic wasps of demonstrated importance as
              biological control agents of insect pests and of general evolutionary interest.
              This group has over 3,000 species described, but the vast majority are either
              undescribed or unidentifiable. These wasps attack and kill the eggs of other
              insects and spiders, thus acting as a natural means to keep pest populations at
              low levels. The project will monograph the taxonomic diversity and
              relationships of two genera within the family.   %%%  The project  will be an
              important contribution to our understanding of the taxonomy and systematic
              biology of scelionid wasps.  The results of the study will be published in peer
              reviewed publications, in addition the character data, the geographic
              distribution data associated with each specimen, and graphical keys to
              identification will be stored in electronic form as the work proceeds and then
              made available on the Internet. Two graduate students will be trained to
              develop expertise on the systematic biology of these wasps as an integral part
              of the project.
