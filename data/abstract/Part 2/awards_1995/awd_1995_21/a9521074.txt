Abstract    :
              9521074  Brett  A Directory Services testbed based on the WHOIS++ protocol, is 
              proposeed for locating people and resources on the Internet.   WHOIS++ provides
              a highly flexible client/server environment that  allows a user to search
              across multiple distributed databases  located on multiple servers, without
              prior knowledge of the  architecture of the database or the network location of
              the desired  information. This project proposes to deploy a medium-scale 
              (>450,000 entries) WHOIS++ database distributed across at least 13  servers
              (which contain the actual directory data base entries), and  utilizing at least
              six centroids (data bases of indexes which point  to the individual servers) in
              a three-level mesh (centroids which  point to lower-level centroids which, in
              turn, point to the lowest  level of centroids which point to the actual data
              base servers). In  addition, this project proposes to develop a widely-usable
              access  method based on clients for the World Wide Web (e.g., Netscape or 
              Mosaic), create interface modules to allow the use of a number of  different
              database technologies to store the WHOIS++ data,  determine and implement the
              security and privacy issues likely to  be required for use in the commercial
              sector, and determine whether  the protocol will scale to serve the Internet at
              large.
