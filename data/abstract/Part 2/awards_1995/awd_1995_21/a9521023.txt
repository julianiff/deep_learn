Abstract    :
              9521023  Bloomer  This project by Dr. Sherman Bloomer of Oregon State University
              supports a research cruise and subsequent data analysis aimed at understanding
              the development of the Tonga subduction system in the southwestern Pacific. 
              This convergent margin is hypothesized to represent a simple end-member of such
              subduction systems, where rapid convergence and a simple plate margin geometry
              allow testing of a series of hypotheses regarding geologic evolution of the
              "forearc" system.  The program will include detailed seafloor imaging to study
              fault distribution, geophysical studies (seismic reflection, gravity and
              magnetics) to examine subsurface architecture, and extensive rock sampling to
              examine the development of the arc system geochemically.  Of particular
              interest will be the distribution of serpentinite diapirs and evidence of
              hydrothermal fluid migration in the arc system.  This project is supported in
              collaboration with award 9521039 to Dr. Dawn Wright, also at Oregon State
              University, whose support comes under the NSF Faculty Early Career Development
              (CAREER) Program.  That award provides support for Dr. Wright over four years
              to develop new, interdisciplinary courses in the marine and geological
              sciences, to promote scientific careers to undergraduate and high school
              students, and to carry out a two-pronged research program in different aspects
              of marine geophysics.  The first part of the proposed research focusses on the
              study of the geophysical development of the Tonga forearc, and Dr. Wright will
              participate in the field program, and she will have principal responsibility
              for post-cruise analysis of the geophysical data collected during the project.
