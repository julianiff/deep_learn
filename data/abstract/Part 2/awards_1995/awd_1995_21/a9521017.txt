Abstract    :
              9521017  Crawford   The diversity of plants and animals on oceanic islands has
              long fascinated naturalists, and continues to pose challenging questions about
              evolution and biogeography.  Graduate student Seung-Chul Kim under the guidance
              of faculty adviser Prof. Daniel Crawford at Ohio State University is studying
              the numerous speaies of woody sunflowers of the group Dendrosonchus on the
              several islands of the Canaries in the mid-Atlantic Ocean.   Morphological
              features of these plants have been analyzed by other taxonomists, who have
              concluded that some 17 species of Dendrosonchus inhabit various parts of the
              Canary Islands chain.  Worries about the reliability of various morphological
              characters and the possibility of parallel evolution of particular growth forms
              provide a rationale for searching for additional, new characters to test
              current taxonomic and phylogenetic notions about these plants.  The study will
              emphasize the collecting and analyzing of DNA sequence data from fresh and
              herbarium material of all Dendrosonchus species and of several potential
              mainland African relatives, in order to use mutational differences as a gauge
              of evolutionary relationships among the species.   The study of Macaronesian
              Dendrosonchus will integrate morphological comparisons, DNA sequence
              differences in nuclear and chloroplast genes, and protein electrophoretic
              assessments of genetic variability within and among populations.  The goal is
              to construct a robust phylogenetic tree for the many species of Dendrosonchus
              and to examine their geographical distributions and morphology in order to
              understand the island-based evolution of these plants.
