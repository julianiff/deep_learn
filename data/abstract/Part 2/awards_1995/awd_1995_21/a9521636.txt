Abstract    :
              9521636  Mohammed    The award is for the International Conference on
              Intelligent  System Applications to Power Systems (ISAP), Jan. 28-Feb. 2, 
              1996, Orlando, Florida.  This conference is concerned with the  newest research
              and development on intelligent systems,  application to power systems,
              including knowledge-based systems,  neural networks, fuzzy logic, and machine
              learning.  The  conference is a prestigious one which is attended by key 
              researchers in the field from 20-30 countries.  NSF and  EPRI  supported
              previous ISAPs.  The conference has a good balance  between industry and
              university participants - about half of the  last ISAP was from industry. 
              Therefore, it is an important forum  for academic researchers to develop
              collaboration with the  industry.  This conference is also multi-disciplinary
              since the  diverse fields of intelligent systems and power systems are 
              involved.    ***
