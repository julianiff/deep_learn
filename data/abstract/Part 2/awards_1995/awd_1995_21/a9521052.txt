Abstract    :
              9521052  Olsen    In recent years, the design and use of compact transmission
              lines  has become more common for reasons related to aesthetics, power 
              transmission efficiency and environmental concerns.  Hardware on  these compact
              lines is exposed to higher surface electric fields  than on lines of more
              conventional designs.  Thus, corona which  is responsible for a number of
              undesirable effects, is a more  important design criterion for hardware to be
              used on new and  upgraded lines.  In this work, it is proposed to develop a new
               methodology for the design of such hardware.  The first part is  to develop an
              appropriate criterion for predicting the initiation  of corona streamers on
              conductors with curvature in two  directions.  To do this, a theory described
              in this proposal will  be calibrated using a set of carefully controlled corona
               initiation experiments.  The second is to incorporate this theory  as an
              optimization criterion in a computer program to design  hardware.  Finally, a
              number of hardware designs will be  developed and tested against those
              developed with simpler  existing criteria.  ***
