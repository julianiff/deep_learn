Abstract    :
              9521743  Perera  Graduate student and postdoctoral student participation in
              emerging interdisciplinary technologies such as neural networks, sensors,
              chaos, artificial intelligence, etc. will be enhanced by providing partial
              support to attend international conferences.  Participants will be selected
              from the attendees at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MODELING AND SIMULATION
              organized by the "International Association of Science and Technology for
              Development" (IASTED) to be held in Columbo, Sri Lanka from July 26-28, 1995
              and he students whose research interests overlap the novel semiconductor Neural
              Network Device/Sensor areas.  IASTED is an organization whose main purpose is
              to further economic development by promoting science and technology, with
              emphasis on interdisciplinary areas.  This effort of promoting
              interdisciplinary technological conferences will help the new generation of
              scientists and engineers who need to broaden their expertise beyond their
              training in a highly focused area.  In addition to participants, scientists and
              engineers in Sri-Lanka, a developing country, will also profit from this
              particular meeting, due to the exposure to the new research ideas and
              developments in the western world.  ***
