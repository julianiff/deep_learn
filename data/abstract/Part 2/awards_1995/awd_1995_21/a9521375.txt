                                   The  roles  of  mechanoreception in predator  detection 
              by  epipelagic   and   mesopelagic   calanoid   copepods    (Acartia, 
              Labidocera,  Undinula, Euchaeta, Pleuromamma, and  Gaussia  spp.)  will  be 
              evaluated  from  morphological, neurophysiological  and  behavioral 
              perspectives.  The hypothesis to be  tested  is  that  escape  behavior  is
              triggered by mechanical stimulation  of  two  specific neurons (GAMs) in each
              antenna.  A second focus will  be  a  comparison  of  conditions eliciting
              bioluminescent  discharge  with   conditions  leading  to  the  stereotypic  
              rapid   escape  (="jumps").    ***
