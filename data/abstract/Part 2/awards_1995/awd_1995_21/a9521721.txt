Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9521721    This is a study of the feasibility of using fully
              densified (nonporous) ion-conducting perovskites as catalytic membranes in
              membrane reactors for the oxidative coupling of  methane.  It is a
              collaborative effort between Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, who
              prepares and characterizes the membranes, and Washington State University,
              which performs the reactor studies.  Two membranes will be studied, one a
              lanthanum-strontium-cobalt-iron-oxygen system, the other a
              lanthanum-barium-cobalt-iron-oxygen system.  Measurements of oxygen permeation
              and catalytic selectivity are done at elevated pressures.  Dynamic X-ray
              diffraction is used to monitor the stability of the membrane.    Oxidative
              coupling of methane is a process that converts natural gas to a valuable
              chemical feedstock in a single step.  Despite its obvious attractiveness, a
              cost-effective technology using this approach has been elusive.  This project
              combines advances in catalytic science, reactor design, and new materials to
              this problem.  ***
