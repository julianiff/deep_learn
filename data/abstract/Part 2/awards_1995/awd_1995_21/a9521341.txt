Abstract    :
              9521341  Davison    The  study  will examine stress-tolerance in two major
              groups  of  perennial intertidal macroalgae, the red and brown seaweeds.  The 
              research  will test the hypothesis that active oxygen is involved  in  emersion
              stress of intertidal seaweeds.  Damage due to active  oxygen   will  be 
              determined  in  stress-tolerant  and   stress-  susceptible  species exposed to
              emersion stress by measuring  the  peroxidation  of  membrane  lipids.   Plants
               will  be  grown  in  laboratory  culture under conditions that increase their 
              ability  to  withstand  emersion  stress.  If the research  hypothesis  is 
              correct, increases in stress tolerance should be associated  with  increased
              levels of antioxidants and/or protective enzymes.   The  proposed  research 
              will  also determine if  intertidal  seaweeds  express  specific
              stress-proteins in response to emersion stress.  The  results of the
              physiological studies will be used to  design  field  experiments  to measure
              the occurrence and  importance  of  sublethal  emersion stress in natural
              communities and to  compare  the  allocation of resources to stress-tolerance
              in low and  high  shore  species.   This  research  represents  one  of  the 
              first  attempts to understand the processes that confer stress tolerance  in 
              intertidal  seaweeds and will provide valuable insights  into  the  ecology and
              physiology of these plants.  Information on  the  mechanism of stress tolerance
              will allow ecologists to assess the  costs  of  stress  tolerance  and relate 
              these  to  reproductive  output, growth and competitive ability.    ***
