Abstract    :
              9521930  SCHELTEMA   Members of the class Aplacophora are a group of worm-like,
              marine Mollusks living at great depths in association with deep-sea thermal
              vents.  There are about 300 described species and an estimate of possibly
              another 600 species to be described as part of this study.  These organisms
              have been little studied, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining
              specimens.  Dr. Amelie Scheltema has assembled some 20,000 specimens obtained
              from about 60 surveys and expeditions.  She is one of only three taxonomic
              specialists, all of whom are nearing retirement, who study these organisms, and
              she is the only one in the western hemisphere.  She will contribute to the need
              for training a next generation of systematists by advising and working with
              both undergraduate and graduate students as well as a postdoctoral
              associate(s).   The efforts of Dr. Scheltema and her trainees will result in
              both published monographic treatment of the class Aplacophora and information
              available in electronic form.  She will be assisted by malacological colleagues
              who are developing standards for databasing of taxonomic information for the
              Phylum Mollusca.   This study will contribute to our very limited knowledge of
              the biological diversity of marine invertebrate organisms.  Recent
              pharmacological prospecting efforts suggest that these little studied marine
              creatures may be rich resources for natural product chemicals that may be
              turned to utilities for human life ranging from anesthetics to antibiotic,
              antiviral and antitumor drugs.  In addition to providing knowledge of the
              relationships among aplacophoran taxa, the results of this study should shed
              light on ancient relationships of diverse groups of multicellular animals and
              provide a basis for further studies involving the population biology, ecology,
              biogeography, etc. of these animals.
