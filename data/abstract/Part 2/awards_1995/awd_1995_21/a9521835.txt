Abstract    :
              9521835  Sperling    In spite of their unobtrusive size and appearance,
              tortricid moths  are among the most significant pests of forest trees and fruit
              orchards  worldwide. More than 6,600 species have been named and there are at
              least  as many left to be described, particularly in tropical regions. Many of
              the  pest species are part of complexes that continue to challenge modern 
              taxonomists. Unfortulately, few people have the expertise or experience  that
              is required to unravel the diversity and complexity of tortricid  moths.  %%% 
              The objectives of this project are to train students in  morphological,
              ecological and molecular investigations of tortricid  taxonomy, and to produce
              electronic databases and keys for the  identification of these moths.
              Catalogues and classifications will be  developed for several tribes of
              tortricids in the New World. This work will  allow insight into the origins of
              plant feeding specialization and tropical  biodiversity. The project will also
              contribute to the development of  computer infrastructure for organizing and
              accessing knowledge about an  economically important family of moths.  ***
