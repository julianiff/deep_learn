Abstract    :
              9521747  Courter  MCNC requests support from NSF for connection of North
              Carolina  Center for Independent Higher Education to the Internet through the 
              NC-REN regional network.  NC-REN is the midlevel network located in  the state
              of North Carolina that will provide operations and  network information
              services. It will provide the North Carolina  Center for Independent Higher
              Education with a connection to the  Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect most  research and education organizations in the United
              States   The  college needs the Internet connection to be able to access 
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world. The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of  the North Carolina
              Center for Independent Higher Education.
