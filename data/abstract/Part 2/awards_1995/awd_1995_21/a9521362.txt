Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Michael   Topp
              will use Rotational Coherence Spectroscopy, and other laser based   techniques
              to probe the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of gas   phase clusters
              containing 3-aminophthalimide and bianthryl.  These   systems are chosen
              because of the strong solvent dependence exhibited by   the excited state
              lifetimes and fluorescence spectra of these species in   the liquid phase. 
              This research will determine the interactions   responsible for changes in the
              charge distribution, including   charge-transfer, induced by electronic
              excitation.  Such information is   essential to a complete understanding of the
              structures, properties, and   interactions of molecules in condensed phases. 
              Gas phase clusters provide an ideal environment to probe the details of  
              molecular interactions between solute and solvent.  Professor Topp's   research
              will determine how solvent molecules affect the structure and   properties of a
              solute molecule in these clusters.  This research will   enhance our
              understanding of the stabilities and reactivities of liquid   phase species,
              and the forces responsible for these properties
