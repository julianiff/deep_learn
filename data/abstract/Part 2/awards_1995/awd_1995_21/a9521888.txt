Abstract    :
              9521888  Mukhopadyay    This  project  is  aimed at exploring a new  and 
              innovative  method  of  tailoring the superconductor-metal interface  by 
              doping the surface of the superconducting oxide with bromine  which  was  found
               to modify its chemical  interaction  with  metals.   Ag-superconductor
              composite samples  with  undoped  and  halogen-doped superconducting oxides
              will  be  prepared  and  comparison of  their physical properties  (Jc  ,  Tc 
              ,  microstructure  and how each property changes  with  thermal  and 
              electrical  cycling)  will  be  made.   This  study  if  successful,  will 
              provide a new dopant for superconductors,  which will improve the overall
              oxide-metal composites.  %%%  Surface  treatment of oxide superconductors by
              bromine  will  be  tested.  If successful, it will provide a new method for 
              achieving    high   quality   and   of   better   properties  superconductor: 
              metal composites.
