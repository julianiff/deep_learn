Abstract    :
              9521744  OCONNOR   Mites are an extremely diverse invertebrate group
              (Chelicerata: Arachnida: Acariformes) including terrestrial, aquatic, free
              living and parasitic forms.  This award will support monographic research in
              the mite family Acaridae which contains some 90 genera and includes the most
              important mite pests of stored food products as well as species responsible for
              house dust allergies.  Dr. OConnor is a well recognized mite systematist and
              highly qualified for training a new generation of researchers.  This award will
              support the education and training of two United States graduate students and
              three postdoctoral associates who will return their systematic expertise to
              Japan, Costa Rica and Australia.  Research results will be made available in
              published and electronic form  and a practical guide to mite pests of stored
              products and house dust will be produced.   This research will contribute to
              our knowledge of the biological diversity of mites, a group of organisms in
              great need of systematic attention, and new systematists capable of further
              research with these organisms will be trained.  The results of this research
              have clear implications of both medical and economic importance.  Beyond that,
              further research concerning the complex development or life cycles of these
              mites and their dispersal by phoresy or hitchhiking on insects will be
              enhanced.
