Abstract    :
              9521517  Sawyer    Joint US-German MCS and wide-angle seismic experiment to
              study the  Galicia Interior Basin/Galicia Bank rifted continental margin and 
              transform boundary with Iberia Abyssal Plain margin segment to the  south.
              S-reflector under the Galicial outer Bank will be the focus.  A dense
              instrumented MCS/OBS wide angle seismic profile (56 OBS  deployments) and 12
              deep-penetrating MCS profiles are planned. The  sediment-starved Galicial
              Margin is well constrained and has no  post-rift volcanic or slat tectonics
              associated with it which makes  is a good place to study rifted margins.
              Existing ODP data will  provide ground truth.
