Abstract    :
              9521116  Smith    The  mechanisms and rates of sediment mixing by the  feeding 
              and movements of animals, termed bioturbation, may  profoundly influence
              chemical recycling, microstratigraphy,  and  faunalcommunity  structure at the
              deep-sea floor.  Recent studies of ingestion  by  bottom-dwelling fauna 
              suggest they  consume  newly sedimented, highly organic  particles.  If such
              selective  feeding is widespread,  biogeochemical models, based on single
              bioturbation tracers,  would provide unreliable predictions  about
              bioturbation,  microbial  metabolism,  sediment  diagenesis,  and strata 
              formation.  This  study  will  test  three  alternative,  mechanistic 
              hypotheses  by: assaying ratiotracer  activities  in deposit-feeder  guts and
              on sediment  particles of various  sizes. Specifically, tracer-dependent 
              mixing may result from  (1)  sizedependent ingestion of Th-  234-rich particles
              by deposit  feeders, (2)  selective  ingestion of young, food-rich particles by
              deposit feeders,  independent  of  size, or (3)  passive  cascade  and/or 
              active  sequestering  of  newly  deposited  particles  in  animal burrows.
