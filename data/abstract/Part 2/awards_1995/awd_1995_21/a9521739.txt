Abstract    :
              9521739  Long      The goal of this project is to learn how to produce 
              practical magnets based on R2Fel7 materials by adding a  combination of
              substitutional and interstitial elements. The  proposed work involves both
              synthesis and characterization  studies using magnetic, neutron diffraction,
              and Mossbauer  spectroscopies. Samples will be prepared by arc or induction 
              melting, followed by annealing. Magnetic measurements will  be used to
              determine the bulk magnetic properties of the  resulting materials. Rietveld
              refinement of neutron  diffraction data will be used to determine the
              crystallo-  graphic and magnetic properties of the materials, including  site
              occupancies of the substitutional and interstitial  elements and the magnetic
              moments at each magnetic atom  site. Mossbauer spectral analysis will be used
              to obtain  detailed microscopic information about the magnetic  properties and
              local electronic environment at each iron  site. A Wigner-Seitz cell analysis
              of each crystallographic  site will be used to determine the relationship
              between the  site's microscopic crystallographic and magnetic properties  and
              the corresponding bulk properties of the magnets.  %%%  The discovery in the
              early 1980's of the rare earth-iron-  boron magnets revolutionized the
              permanent magnet industry.  These materials offered a significant improvement
              in  magnetic properties over the previous best permanent  magnetic materials,
              at about half the cost in terms of  energy stored per unit mass of material.
              However, the Curie  temperature of the rare earth-iron-boron magnets is less 
              than 60% of the Curie temperature of the previous best  permanent magnets.
              Substitutional additions unfortunately  did not substantially increase the
              highest Curie temperature  of the compounds and their practical utility. The
              goal of  this project is to learn how to make practical magnets based  on
              R2Fel7 materials by the addition of a combination of  substitutional and
              interstitial elements. The right combina-  tion of elements sho uld greatly
              improve the thermomagnetic  properties of such materials.  ***
