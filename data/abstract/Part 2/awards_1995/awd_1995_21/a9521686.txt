Abstract    :
              9521686  Pyrak-Nolte  The Department of Civil Engineering and Geological
              Sciences at  the University of Notre Dame is ideally suited for developing a 
              unique program to investigate the geomechanical and structural  components for
              the nation's infrastructure because of its  interdisciplinary nature.  The
              acquisition of a state-of-the art  test facility will amplify the thrust of our
              effort in an  integrated manner.  The objective of this proposal is to acquire 
              a servo-controlled bi-axial hydraulic test system with both  static and dynamic
              loading capabilities to create a system that  can be used to test:  ()
              structural components subjected to  cyclic and dynamic loads; and (2) the
              response of rocks and soils  subjected simulated shallow crustal stresses, i.e.
              stresses  encountered at engineering sites or at mining or waste isolation 
              depths.  Earthquake conditions on engineering structural  components will be
              simulated with dynamic actuators that can  apply horizontal displacements while
              the components are subjected  to normal loads from the vertical actuator.  ***
