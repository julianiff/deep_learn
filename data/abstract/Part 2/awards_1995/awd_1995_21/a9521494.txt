Abstract    :
              9521494  Miller   Ductile regime grinding is the term used to describe grinding
              high performance materials like ceramics, so that the material removal
              mechanism is primarily deformation, not brittle cracking with the attendant sub
              surface damage.  This type of material removal has been studied and documented,
              particularly for grinding lenses.  However, general adoption by  industry
              requires innovative ways to improve productivity while minimizing surface
              damage.  This research planning grant will investigate ways to improve material
              removal rates, and identify performance requirements for applications other
              than ceramics.  Two ways to improve material removal rates will be investigated
              experimentally.  The first will use optimized abrasive wheels with small grits
              for the small chips characteristic of ductile regime grinding, and large grits
              to prevent loading.  The way to enhance material removal will use ultrasonic
              excitation to mechanically change the grit size.   A literature review and
              industrial visits will be used to identify performance requirements for
              non-optics applications.     Successful completion of this project will lead to
              higher productivity in processing ceramics suitable for a wider class of
              applications.  This award will also encourage the diversity needed in the
              manufacturing research community.  ***
