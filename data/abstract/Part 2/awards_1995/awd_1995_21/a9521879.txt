Abstract    :
              9521879  BROOKS   The Middle Stone Age is a period when anatomically modern  
              humans replaced more archaic forms.  Recent research findings in   Africa have
              shown that economic activities of humans in this time   may also have been
              associated with crucial behavioral changes.    Excavation of Middle Stone Age
              sites is limited, however, and   long sequences with good faunal preservation
              are rare.  This   project will continue work by an interdisciplinary team of  
              archeologists, paleontologists, geologists, and geochemists at   Middle Stone
              Age and Acheulean sites in the Aduma-Bouri regions   of the Middle Awash Valley
              of Ethiopia.  Continued excavations   will focus on evidence of human economic
              activities in   association with fossil lake shores and deltaic deposits.   
              Parallel work will continue on the relatively little-known Middle   Stone Age
              industries of the Aduma region and the later Acheulan   sites at Bouri in order
              to establish a chronological and   paleoenvironmental relationship between the
              sequences of these   two regions.  Research will include stratigraphic,  
              paleolandscape, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the   Aduma region and
              establishment of an absolute chronology using   several techniques.  The
              project will be coordinated with the   work of a team led by T.D. White that is
              working sites about   30 km to the north.   This project will continue what
              already has been a   productive network of sites in central Ethiopia.  The
              excellent   preservation of materials has generated new insights into the  
              evolution of marine-related industries.  Of special significance   is the
              potential to gain new insights into the behavior   transformation of early
              humans from independent actors into   communal entities who work together and
              employ relatively   sophisticated tools.
