Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    A travel grant to the American Geophysical Union will support U.S.
              researchers to attend an international workshop on "Disturbance and Recovery of
              Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems" to be held in September 1995 at the Arctic
              Center, University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland.  The workshop is organized
              under the auspices of the International Arctic Science Committee.  The workshop
              will identify the Arctic ecosystem sensitivities to disturbance and mechanisms
              for recovery throughout the circumarctic region.  This information is crucial
              to recommendations for remedial and research activities and plans in a part of
              the world that is very sensitive to climate and anthropogenic disturbances.  ??
