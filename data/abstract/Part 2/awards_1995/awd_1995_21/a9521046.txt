Abstract    :
              A problem for an object database management system (ODBMS) is the reclamation of
              storage for persistent, secondary-memory objects that are no longer accessible.
              Although excellent reclamation algorithms have been developed for transient,
              primary-memory objects, these algorithms have been shown to be inappropriate
              for use on secondary-memory objects in object databases. This project
              investigates new algorithms for ODBMS storage reclamation. The critical aspects
              of secondary-memory reclamation are teased apart into a set of distinct policy
              areas. Rigorous trace-driven simulations of the algorithms are performed to
              gain an understanding of the relative performance of alternative policies
              within each area as well as an understanding of the interplay of policies
              across areas. Prototype implementations of the most promising algorithms are
              integrated into an existing ODBMS. This project makes three primary
              contributions to the ODBMS research, development, and user communities. First,
              a set of new reclamation algorithms appropriate for object databases is
              defined. Second, performance evaluations of the algorithms are used to reveal
              the circumstances under which the algorithms should be considered for adoption
              within a particular ODBMS or application. Third, a catalog of benchmark and
              live-application traces is created to establish an empirically founded
              characterization of application behavior that can be used far beyond evaluation
              of reclamation algorithms.
