              of its  campus network to MichNet.  MichNet is the midlevel network located  in
              the state of Michigan.  MichNet will provide operations  management and
              information services and it will give the Spring  Arbor College connection to
              the Internet, a collection of  interoperable networks that connect most
              research and education  organizations in the United States.    The College
              needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information resources
              throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff, and  students of Spring Arbor College.
