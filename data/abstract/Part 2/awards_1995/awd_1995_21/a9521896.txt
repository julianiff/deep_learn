Abstract    :
              In this research project funded by the Office of Special Projects of the
              Chemistry Division, Tilley will explore new, metal-mediated routes to
              electroactive and charge-transporting polymers with an eye to developing
              polymeric materials with tailor-made properties.  Chemical information from
              mechanistic studies will be used to design and synthesize the next generation
              of dehydrocoupling catalysts.  Electronic properties of polystannanes will be
              investigated in detail, and new types of polystannanes will be synthesized in a
              search for new electronic properties and more narrow band-gaps for
              sigma-conjugation.  Functionalized, nano-porous networks with charge-transport
              properties can be developed from some of the supramolecular materials being
              studied here.    %%%  Polymers containing redox-active metal centers will
              provide access to new conducting polymers, magnetically active polymers,
              macromolecular catalysts or electrode mediator systems.  Applications can be
              expected in catalysis, molecular sensing, and chemical separations.
