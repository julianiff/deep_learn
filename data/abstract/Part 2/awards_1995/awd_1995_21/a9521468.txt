Abstract    :
                9521468  Kunze  A statistical approach to analyzing finescale double-diffusive
               interleaving will   be used on multiple large datasets to quantify the effect
              of  interleaving on   isopycnical and diapycnal mixing and quantify finescale
              water mass   variability. The main goals of the study are to determine a 
              universal   spectrum of double-diffusive fluxes and test recent theoretical 
              work which   has elucidated the posible fluxes and dynamics of double-diffusive
                processes.
