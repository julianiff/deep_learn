              of  seven Illinois colleges to the Internet through netILLINOIS and  CICNet
              regional network.  CICNet is the midlevel network located in  the state of
              Illinois that will provide operations and network  information services. It
              will provide the seven colleges with a  connection to the Internet, a
              collection of interoperable networks  that connect most research and education
              organizations in the  United States  The colleges need the Internet connection
              to be able  to access information resources throughout the state, the nation 
              and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff  students of the
              seven Illinois colleges.
