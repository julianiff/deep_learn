Abstract    :
              STEIN, Robert F.  95-21785    Dr. Stein will investigate the interaction between
               solar p-modes, convection, rotation and magnetic   fields.  The research will
              be accomplished by analyzing realistic numerical simulations of the upper solar
                convection zone and photosphere and idealized simulations of the deep
              convection zone and stable   layers below it.  It will also include comparison
              of the simulations with GONG observations and development of simple conceptual
              models to represent the findings.  ***
