Abstract    :
              9521265  Krause  This project is based on recent work by the PIs showing  that
              electric fields can be used to produce phase-separated  polymer alloys with
              unique morphologies.  Film casting in  electric fields has allowed the
              production of samples  containing spherical and ellipsoidal minor phases that
              form  "pearl chains" in the electric field direction, unique  morphologies in
              mixtures of block copolymers with  homopolymers, and  oriented threads of
              semicrystalline minor  phases.  The PIs will now study:  deformations of ionic 
              block copolymer materials (electromechanical materials);  theoretical
              treatments that include the effects of small ion  migration between the
              coexisting phases and the time  dependence of phase distortion with associated
              breakup in an  electric field; observation of phase distortions obtained  when
              a solution of a polymer in the monomer of another  polymer is allowed to
              polymerize in an electric field;  elongated solid particles in solution as a
              function of  frequency in an AC field in an attempt to observe abrupt  changes
              in orientation; the anisotropy of dielectric  constant in some anisotropic
              blends.  %%%  These studies should result in fundamental knowledge  concerning
              the interaction of heterogeneous systems with an  electric field, both DC and
              AC, and in some potentially  useful materials which utilize heterogeneous
              polymeric  materials and electric fields.  ***
