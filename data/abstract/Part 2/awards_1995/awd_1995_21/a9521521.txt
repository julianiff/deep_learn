Abstract    :
              9521521  Jones  The millimeter- and submillimeter-wave range has long been of
              vital interest to radio astronomers and atmospheric scientists, and is becoming
              increasingly important for commercial applications such as automotive collision
              avoidance systems and surveillance radar.  Unfortunately, the development of
              millimeter- and submillimeter-wave systems has  been slow and costly.  At
              present, the most serious challenge for millimeter- and submillimeter wave
              circuit designers is the realization of reliable, moderate power low noise and
              compact solid state sources.  This proposal addresses these issues by  focusing
              on the investigation of high performance Transferred Electron Oscillators for
              100-300 Ghz.    The goals of this three year research program are 1)
              Theoretical and experimental investigation of novel GaAs, InP, and GaN Stable
              Depletion Layer Transferred Electron Devices for improved 150-300 Ghz operation
              in second-harmonic cavities, 2) Advanced computer-aided design of Transferred
              Electron Devices and the associated second-harmonic oscillator cavities, and 3)
              Design, construction and testing of high reliability, digitally controlled,
              second-harmonic TEO systems.  This project will involve a variety of research
              areas, including millimeter- wave solid state device theory, device
              fabrication, advanced computer-aided design of nonlinear circuits and
              oscillator system design.    The research effort is an Academic-Industry
              collaboration under the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
              (GOALI) program.  The University of Virginia researchers will work in close
              collaboration with J.E. Carlstrom Company, Litton Solid State, Santa Clara, CA.
               This GOALI program will enable collaboration with the two leading corporations
              selling advanced TEO systems.  Future progress in the development of
              millimeter- and submillimeter-wave systems for scientific and commercial
              applications will depend critically on the availability of reliable and compact
              solid state sources, and implementation of  this research program will be an
              important step toward this goal.  ***
