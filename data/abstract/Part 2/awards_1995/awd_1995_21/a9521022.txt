Abstract    :
              Abstract  Matalon  CTS-9521022    The proposed work is essentially an extension
              of research currently being carried out by the PI in the area of flame
              dynamics.  The primary objective of the proposed effort is to re-examine,
              extend and generalize a model that the PI has developed for the flame speed
              dependence in terms of  curvature, strain and non-steady effects in the thin
              premixed flamelet regime.  Specific topics will include the investigation of
              the following: (1) time dependent flame structure in which unsteady
              perturbation and large amplitude solutions will be considered, (2) propagation
              in near-stoichiometric mixtures, (3) effects of nonuniform mixtures on the
              unburned gas, and (4) effects of interactions of a premixed flame with surfaces
              and in confined environments.  The general methodology will involve the use of
              large activation energy asymptotics based on one-step global kinetics, with the
              addition of allowing for density changes from unburned to burned gases.
