Abstract    :
              9521194  Sumney  This proposal describes a cooperative partnership between the
              U.S. Government, as brokered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through a
              new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and the Semiconductor Research
              Corporation (SRC). The new MOU extends an eight-year cooperative partnership
              and permits various Government Agencies to provide support to SRC for
              semiconductor research. This research is conducted in U.S. universities with a
              resultant intellectual and physical technology transfer to the U.S.
              Semiconductor Industry.  The intellectual technology part is the knowledge-base
              provided by graduate students industry while the physical part is the actual
              research findings in the form of technology development coupled with
              software/modeling programs.  ***
