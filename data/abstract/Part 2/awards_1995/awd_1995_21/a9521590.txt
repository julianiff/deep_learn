Abstract    :
              9521590  Shah       This award provides funding to conduct a workshop on 
              engineering design.  The field of engineering design to date has  failed to
              coalesce around a coherent design theory.  Yet  engineering design is an
              intense activity of engineering,  responsible for the bulk of the value added
              for the profession.   This workshop will bring together about 50 individuals
              who are  experts in engineering design and related fields to discuss the 
              possibility of obtaining a theory of design and to set research  funding
              priorities toward this goal.  The workshop will be  conducted over a period of
              three days, and it will result in a  written document that is intended to serve
              as the basis for setting  research directions and priorities in the NSF Design
              and  Integration Engineering program.       Engineering design is crucial to
              the entire technological  enterprise of the nation.  Advances in the theory of
              engineering  design will impact virtually every industry.  The teaching of 
              engineering design is also crucial to the economic health of the  nation.  If
              successful, this workshop could have a significant  impact on the conduct of
              engineering design and the engineering  education.
