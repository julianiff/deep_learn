Abstract    :
                  The National Center for Supercomputing Applications is  requesting $32, 423
              in supplemental funding to the  cooperative agreement to support a two-day
              workshop on  Advanced Computing for Biological Imaging.  The workshop  will be
              held April 28-29, 1995 in the Beckman Institute for  Advanced Science and
              Technology at the University of  Illinois.  The purpose of the workshop is to
              provide a forum  for discussion about integrating imaging modalities used in 
              biological research with advanced computing systems.  The  goal of the workshop
              is to bring together researchers and  developers for an exchange of
              applications, techniques and  technologies.  The proceedings of the workshop
              will be  published as a special issue of the Biological Bulletin.  The printed
              proceedings will be supplemental with Internet  access to a WWW server
              containing images and animation.  ***
