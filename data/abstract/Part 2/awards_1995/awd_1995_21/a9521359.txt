Abstract    :
              9521359  Smyth  Direct numerical simulations of turbulent patches representative
              of  those   observed in the main thermocline will be conducted on massively 
              parallel   machine. The goal of this study is to improve the interpretation of 
              exisitng   one-dimensional microstructure observations and to plan future 
              experiments.   In particular the sampling statistics of turbulent kinetic
              energy  and   temperature variance dissipation rates, the degree of anisotropy
              of    turbulence and the variability of the mixing efficiency under  various
              flow   conditions will be determined.
