Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department at Indiana  University acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer which will
              be used in research investigations in the  following areas: (1) metallo-organic
              chemistry; (2) metal carboxylate chemistry; (3) materials-related  chemistry
              and organometallic chemistry; and (4) nucleic acid catalysts (ribozymes and
              deoxyribosymes).    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the  elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific 
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules  in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out  frontier research. 
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis,  and in biology.
