Abstract    :
                  9521875  Hellawell    This two-year renewal provides for completion of
              research on  the  development  of equiaxed grains in metal castings.   The 
              initial  source  for  the grain solidification is thought to  be  dendrite 
              fragments  that  have become detached within  the  earlier  mushy  region  of
              the casting.  The fragments are transported  out  into  the   bulk   liquid  by
               thermo-solutal  convection.    Surviving  fragments grow, sink, and eventually
              block columnar grains.   The  steps  in  modeling the process have been
              identified and analyzed  in  some  detail,  and it is recognized that the
              conditions  that  promote  dendrite  arm detachment are associated  with 
              transient  growth  conditions.  These conditions mirror those in a  casting, 
              where   columnar   dendritic   growth   front   is   decelerating  continuously
                and   the   temperature   gradient   is    falling  simultaneously.   This
              critical step in the process  is  examined  analytically  and experimentally
              using transparent analogues  and  selected metal alloys.  %%%  This topic
              addresses a major gap in understanding the development  of  the  microstructure
              of alloy castings.  This complex  process  should  be  clarified  by the
              experimental and  theoretical  work  proposed.  ***
