Abstract    :
                  9521702  Meirovitch  The objectives are to provide a forum for exchange of
              ideas on  structural dynamics and structural control and to disseminate 
              results of research in the areas.  The symposium aims to bring  together
              researchers from a board spectrum of engineering areas,  such as aerospace,
              civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, as  well as engineering
              mechanics.  The scope of the symposium has  changed and expanded over the years
              so as to reflect the interests  and needs of the technical community.  The
              symposium covers  theoretical, numerical and experimental developments.
