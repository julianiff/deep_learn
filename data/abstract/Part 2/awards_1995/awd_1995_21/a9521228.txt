Abstract    :
              9521228  McCaughan  Wavelength division multiplex/switching networks have the
              potential for greatly augmenting the flexibility and information carrying
              capacity of present fiber optic systems.   Channel number and channel density
              are currently limited by the center-frequency stability of diode lasers. 
              Processing variations and carrier-induced index changes can produce up to +7 nm
              wavelength variations among devices.  As an system  composed of an array of Er:
              LiNbO3 waveguide distributed feedback lasers integrated with traveling-wave
              modulators. This material system possesses none of the processing or electronic
              variabilities of  semiconductor lasers.  Lasing frequencies should, therefore,
              be determined solely by the reproducibility of the grating lithography.     We
              propose a joint effort between the University of Wisconsin (UW) and United
              Technologies Photonics (UTP) to produce the device. We expect to demonstrate
              fully functional and packaged devices.  The results of this program will be a
              greatly enhanced understanding of these active waveguide devices, and the
              in-depth knowledge and experience to develop commercial LiNbO3 products.  ***
