Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  This study compares the formation and changes in roles and
              activities of ethnic organizations serving Jews and Italians in Argentina and
              Venezuela.  It draws on theories of immigrant and ethnic integration and tests
              their applicability to Latin America.  Data are based on existing records from
              1940 to the 1990s obtained from newspapers, ethnic organizations, and ethnic
              schools.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of
              how immigrant ethnic groups form communities that foster (or impede) their
              integration into host societies.  It will also add generally to understanding
              Latin American societies and how they compare to the United States.  In
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the
              next generation of social scientists.
