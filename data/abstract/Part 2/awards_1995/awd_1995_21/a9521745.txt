Abstract    :
              9521745  Claffy  General Atomics proposes in collaboration with Digital
              Equipment  Corporation as a partner on this project, to develop and deploy a 
              scalable caching and replication system across strategic network  locations
              within the United States.  Digital Equipment Corporation  has committed to
              significant cost sharing and collaboration, as an  integral part of this
              proposal.  Our goal is to facilitate the  evolution of U.S. information
              provisioning with an efficient  national architecture for handling highly
              popular information.  Our  proposed effort is unique in tying together research
              and  infrastructure.  The research and deployment experience of the  principal
              investigators and their proximity to NSF backbone sites  will leverage existing
              NSF-sponsored activities, at the  supercomputer centers as well as activities
              related to resource  discovery at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
