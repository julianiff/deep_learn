Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  This study compares the factors that determine whether Japanese women
              will stay in or leave the labor force after marriage, with particular attention
              to the role of education.  It tests the applicability of human capital theory
              in the Japanese context and provides new comparisons with the United States. 
              The study will be based on a newly-collected survey of 2,000 women in central
              Japan, with respondents selected to reflect different educational experiences. 
              %%%   This study will contribute to the sociological understanding of the
              relation between women's human capital and the continuity of social
              stratification.  It will also add to our understanding of Japanese society
              generally and the ways it compares with the United States.  Policy makers
              should find useful information about the conflicts between work and family.  
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the
              next generation of social scientists.
