Abstract    :
                NSF Workshop on Database Research in the Era of Information  Infrastructure 
              The objective of this planning workshop is to  discuss issues of current
              concern regarding database research.   Participants are selected from a broad
              range of database interests  and viewpoints, including both industrial and
              academic research.   Additional participants are chosen to represent important
              related  areas, such as the artificial intelligence, 
              information-infrastructure, and computer architecture communities.  Issues of
              concern include the role of databases in the information  infrastructure, the
              relationship of research to industrial database  requirements, and the likely
              impact of new research directions.  Following the workshop a report of
              conclusions will be written and  widely disseminated, including on-line
              world-wide access.  ***
