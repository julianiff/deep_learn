Abstract    :
              9521944  Pfister   Despite their ecological importance in decay and
              decomposition of organic matter and their occasional pathogenicity in plants
              and animals, fungi as a group remain poorly known, with few specialists able to
              identify the taxonomic entities or to pursue further biological investigations.
               One especially difficult complication lies in the fact that fungal organisms
              may live and reproduce asexually, through specialized spores, for years,
              without showing evidence of the sexual reproductive or "fruiting" structures
              that make possible accurate taxonomic identification and phylogenetic analysis.
               Dr. Donald Pfister at Harvard University, a mycologist with a long and
              productive record of research on ascomycete fungi, is teaming with colleague
              Dr. Michael Donoghue, with interests in theoretical aspects of systematic and
              phylogenetic research,  in a study of filamentous fungi placed in the suborder
              Sarcoscyphinae.  These are largely wood decomposers or saprobes, although some
              are known plant pathogens; many species are estimated yet to be described,
              especially from tropical environments.  A major emphasis of their five-year
              program is on the integration of traditional morphological studies with two
              additional lines of evidence: molecular analyses of DNA sequences of fungal
              samples, and laboratory culturing to asqess mating behavior between geographic
              isolates.    Training in both practical and theoretical aspects of fungal
              systematics will involve undergraduate and graduate students, as well as
              postdoctoral associates.  Colleagues in South America will also participate in
              the work.  The University provides superb laboratory and collections
              facilities, and computerization is a hallmark of all aspects of the research,
              including specimen databasing, taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, and
              Internet linkage to major fungal resources.
