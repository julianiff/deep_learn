Abstract    :
              Hazardous organic compounds present in aqueous waste streams can be rapidly and
              safely converted to CO2 and H2O through homogeneous oxidation reactions.  When
              the reaction conditions exceed both the critical pressure and critical
              temperature of water, this oxidative treatment process is referred to as
              supercritical water oxidation (SCWO).  SCWO is promising new technology for
              waste destruction, and it is attracting increasing attention for possible
              applications such as water purification as part of a life-support system for
              manned space missions, and the destruction of military hazardous waste, mixed
              wastes, and wastes from the chemical, petroleum, and pulp and paper industries.
               The design, optimization, and control of an SCWO process requires knowledge of
              the governing reaction kinetics.  The PIs will conduct parallel experimental
              and modeling studies to determine these governing kinetics.  One part of the
              work involves developing phenomenological reaction models for the SCWO of real
              pollutants.  They will determine global rate laws for reactant disappearance,
              CO2 prod uction, and byproduct formation and destruction by correlating the
              large sets of experimental data.  They also plan to develop a mechanism-based
              reaction model for SCWO chemistry and perform the experiments necessary to
              validate the model, which will be based on individual elementary reaction steps
              and their associated kinetics.  They plan to develop reliable mechanism-based
              models for the oxidation of increasingly complex organic compounds 
              individually and as mixtures by these techniques.
