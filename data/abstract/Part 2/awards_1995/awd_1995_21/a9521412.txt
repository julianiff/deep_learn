Abstract    :
              9521412  Hennage  This proposal is in support of the OSA Quantum Optoelectronics
              topical group meeting.  This meeting will cover advances in quantum-confined
              structures as in the past meetings, but the emphasis for the 1995 meeting will
              be on new materials and new approaches for quantum confinement, and novel 
              light emitters.  Further new themes for 1995 will be photon confinement in
              microcavity and related structures, and new measurement techniques combing
              ultra-high spatial resolution wit ultrashort time resolution.    Topic Areas
              Include:    *Fundamental and device aspects of lower dimensional material
              structures  *New materials for quantum confinement  *Physics of novel light
              emitting structures such as QED effects in microcavities, detectors and
              modulators.  *Optical and optoelectronic phenomena derived from quantum
              confinement  *Techniques for synthesis and nanofabriation of ultrasmall
              structures  *New measurement techniques based on STM, NSOM an dAFM for studying
              quantum-scale phenomena    Funding for this meeting is requested to ensure an
              international and domestic representation by the best people in this specific
              community. In order to accomplish this goal, we feel there is a need to offer
              students, junior university faculty and other faculty partial travel support.
