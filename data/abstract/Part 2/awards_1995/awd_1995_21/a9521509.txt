Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Georgiadis    The proposers plan to investigate complex laminar flows
              involving chaotic stirring with applications in porous heat exchangers and
              screw extruders.  A lattice-Boltzman numerical technique will complement
              experimental measurements using magnetic resonance imaging to produce a
              fundamental understanding of the character of the flow.
