Abstract    :
              9521470  Collier         This program is a hydrothermal plume sampling program 
              that will take place during ALVIN dive program on the  southern East Pacific
              Rise at 17 degrees south.  The dive  program is led by M. Lilley and K Von
              Damm.  The research  will address the evolution of reactive species in the
              young  plumes and will tie the individual vent-classes sampled by  ALVIN to the
              integrated plume compositions leaving the vent  fields.  A series of
              CTD-transmissometer-rosette tows will  provide continuous sections of
              hydrothermal tracers and will  be combined with a series of vertical hydrocasts
               concentrating water samples at specific portions of the  plumes associated
              with ALVIN vents samples.  Real time and  shipboard data will be combined to
              locate or verify the vent  sources by gradient analysis within the framework of
               bathymetric and supporting survey data.
