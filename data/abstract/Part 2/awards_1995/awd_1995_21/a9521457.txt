Abstract    :
              9521457  Bhowmik    This a ward provides funds to permit Dr. Nani Bhowmik, Head,
               Hydrology Division, Illinois State Water Survey, to conduct with  Dr. Il Won
              Seo, Professor of Civil Engineering, Seoul National  University, a U.S.-Korea
              Joint Seminar on the Reduction of  Natural Disasters in Water Environments. 
              This award will support  the participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers and
              two U.S.  graduate students, each of whom will present scientific papers.   
              The reduction of natural disasters in water environments is a  matter of great
              concern in many parts of the world.  In the  United States, the need for
              minimizing such natural disasters has  been given special attention following
              the great flood of the  Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers in 1993. 
              Because of  the 1993 flood, interest in the scientific and engineering  aspects
              of disaster prevention or reduction due to flooding also  has grown in other
              countries, as well.  Prevention and reduction  of disaster due to the failure
              of dams and other causes also is  of interest.    The joint seminar will
              provide an opportunity for U.S.  participants to exchange scientific
              information with Korean  scientists and engineers on problems in the field of
              this joint  seminar.  The participants from both countries are recognized 
              experts whose presentations will be of mutual interest and  benefit.  This
              project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-  Korea Cooperative Science
              Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and
              Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific
              information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on
              problems of  mutual interest and benefit.  Korean participation is supported 
              by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) with the  cooperation
              of the Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO) and  the Korea Institute of
              Construction Technology (KICT).  ***
