Abstract    :
              9521453  Brazeau    Fertilization success among sessile, marine invertebrates 
              is a largely unknown variable bridging those factors which  field ecologists
              can measure (fecundity, organism size,  population abundance) and one often
              difficult to estimate  (reproductive success).  Using the Caribbean octocoral 
              Baiareum asbestinum as a model animal, this project will  examine temporal and
              spatial variation in reproductive  success for male and female colonies.  The
              reserach will  test the specific prediction that female fertilization  success
              is directly proportional to the nearby abundance  male colonies.  This
              information is crucial for  understanding the abundance and growth of
              invertebrate  populations in coral reef ecosystems and will provide  important
              information for the successful restoration and  management of coral reefs
              worldwide.      ***
