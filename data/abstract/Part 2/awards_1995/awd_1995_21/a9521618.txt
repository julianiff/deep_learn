Abstract    :
              9521618  GREEN    A continuous flow analyzer powered by osmotic pumps has been 
              developed to monitor nitrate concentrations while submerged in  freshwater or
              seawater. Osmotic pumps driven by a NaCl gradient  propel both sample and
              reagents through a miniature continuous flow  manifold.  The analyzer operates
              with sample and reagent flow rates  of about 8.0 and 0.7 ml per month,
              respectively, shows a linear  response from 0 to 20 micromolar nitrate with a
              detection limit of  0.1 micromoles, and has a 90% response time of
              approximately 30  minutes.  The analyzer automatically standardizes itself by 
              correcting for baseline and sensitivity drift by periodically   injecting and
              analyzing known standard solutions.  The system has  operated continuously for
              month-long periods in freshwater and  seawater, and can be adapted to a variety
              of colorimetric analyses.   The research supported here will take this
              demonstrated technology  and develop the chemistries to analyze for a variety
              of trace  metals (i.e., iron, zinc, cadmium, copper and manganese), as well  as
              other macro-nutrients (i.e., silica and phosphate). Potential  applications for
              such analyzers include oceanographic studies as  well as environmental
              monitoring and industrial process control.
