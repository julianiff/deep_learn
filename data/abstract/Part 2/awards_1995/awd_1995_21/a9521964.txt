Abstract    :
                  9521964  Ballance  The Symposium topic is particularly timely because of the
               increasingly wide recognition within the industry that durability  and science
              life production are key issues in the promotion and  development of high
              performance concrete.  Thus, the topic is  directly relevant to NSF's new
              initiative on Civil Infrastructure  Systems.    The symposium will focus on
              research which seeks to elucidate the  mechanisms of chemical degradation, 
              particularly those involving  chemical species from the environment, for
              example, chlorides,  sulfates and carbon dioxide.  It will also address the
              integration  of the processes by which species permeate concrete with the 
              changes in microstructure and properties they bring about.
