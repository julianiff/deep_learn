Abstract    :
              9521336  Steckler       In the Cenozoic many margins underwent major changes in 
              morphology and evolved from carbonate ramp to prograding clastic  shelves,
              while the world climate changed permanently from a  hothouse to icehouse
              conditions.  On NJ margin the switch from  carbonate ramp to siliciclastic
              shelf occurred in the early  Oligocene.  On the Angola margin the
              Eocene-Oligocene boundary  time evidenced a major erosional event.  My Miocene
              both margins  were dominated by siliciclastic progradation and margins evolved 
              to the modern continental margins with flat shelves and shelf-  slope breaks. 
              This pattern is also observed at other margins and  require an increase in
              sediment supply from Oligocene to Miocene.  By mid-Oligocene the carbonate
              factory had shut down over the  previously dominant carbonate ramps.  The
              siliciclastic shift  occurs at the same time as the development of the icehouse
               conditions, a long-term lowering of sea level and increase in  terrigenous
              sediment supply due to enhanced continental  seasonality and erosion.  The
              study will reconstruct the African  margin to understand the shift in
              continental margin morphology  and stratigraphy from seismic data. 
              Backstripping or forward  modeling of the margin will be performed to determine
              the  approximate tectonic subsidence.  ***
