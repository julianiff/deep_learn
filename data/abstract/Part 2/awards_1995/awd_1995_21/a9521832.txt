Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professors F. Barry Dunning and Ken A. Smith of the Chemistry   Department of
              William Marsh Rice University will engage in a continuing   series of
              investigations of electron-molecule and ion-molecule reactions.    In the
              present work the emphasis is on reactions in which atoms in high   Rydberg
              states participate.  Specific problems addressed are the   lifetimes of
              collision intermediates and their stabilization through   energy transfer via
              interactions with a third collision partner.  In   addition, Rydberg atoms will
              be used to study energy transfer in ion-ion   collisions, and  create dipole
              bound negative ions  and investigate their    properties.  Rydberg atoms (or
              molecules) are systems in which an electron is in a   sufficiently large orbit
              so that the whole system resembles that of an   excited hydrogen atom.  With
              increasing excitation the electron goes into   increasingly larger orbits until
              it becomes free of the rest of the atom   which thereby becomes an ion.  
              Chemical reactions in which ions   participate play a major role and a full
              understanding of the reaction   kinetics and dynamics requires, among others, a
               detailed knowledge of   the ion-ion, ion-molecule, and electron- molecule
              collision processes.    The research conducted here is directed toward
              obtaining such knowledge.
