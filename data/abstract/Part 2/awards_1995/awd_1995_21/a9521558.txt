Abstract    :
              Many aeronomic techniques depend on knowledge of the cross section for reactions
              involving  singly ionized atomic oxygen.  In this project, these cross sections
              will be measured using a  triple-quadropole double octopole (TQDO) mass
              spectrometer.  Significant technical advances  have been made in the
              application of this technique for absolute, total, state-selected cross 
              section measurements.  In previous work conducted by the investigators,
              state-selected beams  of ionized oxygen with high purities and intensities were
              prepared for scattering experiments by  controlling the collision energies for
              dissociative charge transfer collisions of singly ionized  helium, neon, and
              argon with molecular oxygen in a radio frequency (RF) ion guide gas cell,  and
              by applying appropriate effective ion trapping potentials to the RF octopole
              ion guide.  The  method also makes use of a differential retarding potential
              method for improving the kinetic  energy resolution of the ionized oxygen
              reactant ions that are produced by the reactions of  molecular oxygen with
              helium, neon, and argon.  Absolute total cross section measurements for  the
              ion-molecule reactions of atomic oxygen with molecular nitrogen, oxygen,
              hydrogen, carbon  dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water are made down to thermal
              energies using the simple  electrostatic aperture of the TQDO apparatus, even
              though the reactant ions are formed  originally with a broad kinetic energy
              distribution.  The investigators will continue these cross  section
              measurements and develop new experimental schemes for absolute cross section 
              measurements of ion-atom reactions relevant to planetary ionospheres.***
