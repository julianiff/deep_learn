Abstract    :
              9521759  Fiedler        Tornadoes are recognized as one of the most violent,
              localized weather  phenomena.  Much progress has been made over the last
              several years in  understanding both the structure of tornadic thunderstorms
              and the dynamics of  tornado vortices.  There still, however, are unanswered
              questions as to the dynamics  of substructures contained within a tornadic
              vortex and the relationship between the  tornado s characteristics and the
              local environment.        In this research, tornadoes will be simulated using a
              very advanced  three-dimensional numerical model.   The model to be used is
              capable of continuous  dynamic grid adaptation and is ideally suited for
              resolving moving entities requiring   enhanced resolution in a relatively small
              region of the modeled domain.  The project  goal is to determine how the
              maximum wind speed in a tornado is related to  environmental conditions, such
              as convective available potential energy and radial  inflow at the base of the
              tornado.  The planned numerical simulations also will allow  a study of
              asymmetric vortex breakdown, instabilities, turbulent transport and  multiple
              vortices.          The results of this research should lead to a better
              understanding of the  especially violent substructures of tornadoes (e.g.
              satellite vortices) and eventually  enhance the ability to predict such
              phenomena.  ***
