Abstract    :
              9521783  Watling  The crustacean order Cumacea is largely unknown for large
              areas of the worldOs oceans and continental margins. Cumaceans are small
              crustaceans, allied with amphipods, isopods, and several other groups, all of
              whom carry their young about in a brood pouch. In many shallow marine habits
              they are important food items in the diets of young fish. Virtually nothing is
              known about the evolutionary history of the group. There is also uncertainty
              associated with many of the characters used in the taxonomy of cumaceans, a
              feature which characterizes several other groups of small crustaceans,
              therefore, principles developed for this group may be used to unravel similar
              problems in other taxa. The taxonomic objective of this research is to
              monograph the cumacean fauna of AmericaOs shores and those in the southeastern
              Pacific, and to test hypotheses regarding utility of taxonomic characters and
              biogeographic history of the group. In addition the project will train the next
              generation of crustacean systematists in both morphological as well as
              molecular methods of systematics through the production of taxonomic
              monographs. A final objective is to provide for the electronic storage and
              archiving of this taxonomic data.   %%  The significance of the project is to
              provide a better understanding of the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships
              among this little known but ecologically important  group of crustaceans. In
              addition the research will produce broadly trained scientists well schooled in
              classic monographic as well as molecular methods of systematics.   ***
