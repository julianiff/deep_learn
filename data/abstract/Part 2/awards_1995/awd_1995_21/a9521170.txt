Abstract    :
                9521170  CANUEL      Lipid biomarkers, elemental (% organic carbon, C/N
              ratios), and  isotopic (C-13) information will be used to: (1) characterize 
              primary source materials in order to develop reliable chemcial  tracers for
              their input, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns  in the sources of
              suspended POM in the Chesapeake Bay, and (3)  evaluate historical changes in
              the delivery of organic materials  using sediments cores. Because of high
              variability in the delivery  processes, the study will focus on processes
              likely to be most  important, namely, freshwater inflow, phytoplankton blooms,
              and  microbially-medicated degradation.    The educational component of this
              career development plan has as  its objectives: (1) the development of graduate
              level courses, (2)  mentoring  of graduate and undergraduate students, and (3) 
              establishing a summer program to initiate high school girls into  scientific
              research.  The Female Initiation into Research in  Science and Technology
              (F.I.R.S.T.) program will place precollege  girsl in labs where they will work
              closely with female mentors.   All of the education objectives will utilize
              research experience as  a teaching tool.  Together the research and education
              plans  outlined in this proposal will build a framework for understanding  key
              processes controlling the delivery and fate of organic  materials in near shore
              environments, including other estuaries,  and the continental shelf and slope.
              Specifically, results from  this study will identify the important sources of
              organic matter  and their relative abundance in the water column and sediments
              of  the Chesapeake Bay.
