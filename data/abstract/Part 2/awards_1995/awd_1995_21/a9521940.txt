              a  connection to the Internet through the SURAnet regional network.    SURAnet
              is the regional network located in the state of Kentucky  that will provide
              operations and network information services.  It  will provide the Southern

              interoperable networks that connect  most research and education organizations
              in the United States.    The college needs the Internet connection to be able
              to access  information resources throughout the state, the nation nd the 
              world.  The connection will benefit the students, faculty and staff  of
              Kentucky Wesleyan College and Brescia College.
