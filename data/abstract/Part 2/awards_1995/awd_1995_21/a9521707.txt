Abstract    :
              9521707  Mandeville    This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology
              Agency  of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Charles Mandeville  of the
              School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode  Island.  Dr. Mandeville will
              work with Dr. Jeffrey  Hedenquist at the Geological survey of Japan in Tsukuba.
               The investigators seek to improve upon the petrologic  methods that are now
              used to estimate the amounts of gases  released to the atmosphere during large
              explosive volcanic  eruptions, amounts that may temporarily alter climate.  The
               proposed research aims to study a suite of Krakatau silicate  melt inclusions
              for evidence of heterogeneous trapping of  immiscible liquid/vapor phases prior
              to the catastrophic  eruption.  Results from this study will be used towards 
              extension of the present method of estimating volatile  discharge to at least
              qualitatively evaluate the presence or  absence of an exsolved vapor phase in
              the upper portion of  zoned magma bodies.  Results from this study will 
              potentially lead to a better understanding of how gas  sampling of degassing
              volcanoes relates to magma bodies at  depth.  ***
