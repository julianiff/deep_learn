Abstract    :
              Ten thousand years ago the global climate was highly dynamic and the vegetation
              of  North America was undergoing the most rapid reorganization of the
              post-glacial period. Spruce forests  that once dominated much of interior North
              America were decreasing in extent as the climate rapidly  warmed. One such
              forest was recently exposed by a mining company in the Upper Peninsula of
              Michigan.  The Gribben forest was buried in-place by glacial sediment and
              remains intact, with completely  preserved plant material, litter, humus
              layers, and soil profiles. Wood from this site was recently  radiocarbon dated
              at approximately 10,000 years old. The site is part of an active mining
              operation  and will be destroyed in the summer of 1995. The objectives of this
              exploratory research are to (1)  sample the buried trees, litter and soil, (2)
              answer fundamental questions about paleo-forest  composition, structure, growth
              and dynamics, and (3) archive samples and distribute data to the  broader
              scientific community so that this unique opportunity to understand a 10,000
              year old forest  and its environment is not  lost to science.   This  Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research  will  provide a unique opportunity to learn
              about the composition, structure, and dynamics of forest  vegetation
              immediately after the glaciers receded from this area. The data will allow a
              direct test of  assumptions of much of the conceptual framework underlying
              forest ecology and paleoecology.
