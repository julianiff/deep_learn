Abstract    :
              Beaubien/ABSTRACT  ATM-9521350           The objective of this research is the
              development of a new  high precision, low cost radiometer (pyrgeometer) to
              measure  infrared radiation in the atmosphere.  Existing devices have not  been
              improved in twenty-five years.  While the proposed radiometer  adopts some
              current techniques and practices of existing devices,  including calibration,
              it also incorporates a unique configuration,  which was identified during the
              Phase I research.    Potential Commercial Applications:         Precision
              infrared radiometers are used in long term climate  experiments, and these
              networks are often deployed on a large-scale  basis over the globe.  There are
              also several industrial  applications where precise radiometric infrared
              measurements can  reduce the cost of batch manufacturing of raw materials.
