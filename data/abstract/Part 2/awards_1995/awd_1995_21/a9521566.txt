              This is an attendance and travel grant for the 22nd Annual  International
              Symposium on Computer Architecture on June 22-24,  1995 in Santa Margherita

              and refereed  paper presentations, continues to serve the various needs of the 
              computer architecture research community. It is an important  conference in the
              computer architecture area. This grant provides  support to help several
              graduate students attend the symposium.
