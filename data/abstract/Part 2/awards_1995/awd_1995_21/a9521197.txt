Abstract    :
              9521197  Hennage  The sixth OSA Topical Meeting on Optical Computing explores
              the  applications of optics in computing, interconnections, and  information
              processing with invited and contributed oral  presentations and posters. 
              Papers are solicited in all facets of  optics in computing from materials,
              devices and components, to  architectures, algorithms and applications. 
              Germane topics include  system demonstrations in digital optical computing,
              optical neural  networks, and novel optical processing architectures,
              development  of active and passive components, devices and materials, and 
              progress in techniques and subsystems such as optical  interconnections,
              optical memory, and optical logic.  ***
