              network located in the state of Massachusetts that will  provide operations and
              network information services. It will  provide the Woods Hole Research Center
              with a connection to the  Internet, a collection of interoperable networks that
              connect most  research and education organizations in the United States   The 
              center needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information
