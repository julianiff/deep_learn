Abstract    :
              Klinger  9521138  This  project consists of a series of numerical  experiments 
              with  the goal of futhering the understanding of the  basin-  scale wind driven
              circulation, thermohaline circulation, and  the  meridional heat transport. 
              Three basic models will  be  used,  a three dimensional general circulation
              model, a  two  dimensional meridional plane model, and an analytic model to 
              describe  the  feedback between ocean and  atmosphere.   The  experiments  will
              be conducted in a rectangular mid-latitude  basin  with  zonal  grid  spacing
              ranging  from  0.5o  (near  western boundary) to 3o, and meridional grid
              spacing  of  2o  everywhere.  ***
