Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Gibson of Virginia
              Polytechnic Institute and State University will develop the methodology of self
              assembling rotaxane systems into supramolecular structures.  This methodology
              depends on the host-guest relationship between bipyridine salts and 32-crown-10
              ethers.  Once assembled, the structure will be stabilized with covalent bond
              formation.  A myriad of structural motifs is planned and incudes linear,
              branched and ultimately dentritic type architecture.  These types of systems
              hold promise for new ventures in the areas of photo and electro devices,
              catalysis and mass transport media.  A new class of supramolecular structures
              is planned from the self assembly of rotaxanes and crown ethers.  Once
              assembled and fixed via covalent bond formation, these types of structures can
              be explored for their photo and electro device properties.  Further, they are
              anticipated to have catayltic properties and may be used as a mass transport
              media.   +                          Ûª? ÑOh ª'  +'ª?0   Ý           +       ]
