Abstract    :
              OCE-9521435    Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor were discovered nearly
              twenty  years ago, and this discovery led to a new understanding of the 
              oceans.  The rate of flow of water from the vents has never been  measured
              directly, it has only been estimated, but the rate of flow  is a fundamental
              character of these vents.  Once the flow rate is  known, we will be able to
              answer major questions about relationship  of hydrothermal vents to the
              chemistry of sea water, and to the  heat released from the earth.  This project
              will developed and test  a sensor that will measure the velocity of fluid flow
              from  hydrothermal chimneys on the ocean floor.
