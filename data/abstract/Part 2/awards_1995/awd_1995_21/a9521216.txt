Abstract    :
                This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing research
              of Professor Cynthia Burrows at the University of Utah.  Primary objectives are
              experiments on the site-specific metal catalyzed modification of DNA and other
              small molecules.  Fundamental problems to be solved are the activation of
              dioxygen factors influencing the alkylation of DNA by nickel complexes and the
              dynamic parameters of nickel catalyzed oxidation of small molecules.   
              Oxidation is a fundamental reaction in chemistry which when applied to organic
              and biological molecules can be useful as well as deleterious.  It assists
              degradration and detoxification in some instances and it can initiate cancer in
              other conditions.  Thus, a thorough understanding of these types of reactions
              is very important.  This proposal addresses a specific aspect of the field
              wherein nickel facilitates the oxidation of DNA, a significant component of
              biological systems.
