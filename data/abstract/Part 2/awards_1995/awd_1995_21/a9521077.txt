Abstract    :
              9521077  Loiselle      This Dissertation Enhancement award from the Americas 
              Program, will support travel to Colombia by Mr. Luis M.  Renjifo and his
              advisor, Dr. Bette A. Loiselle, to study the  impact of forest fragmentation
              and the composition of the  surrounding landscape matrix on populations of
              forest bird  species.    The primary objectives are to address the following
              major  hypotheses:  1) the landscape matrix in which forests are  embedded
              affect bird species composition of small, otherwise  similar, forest areas; and
              2) bird subgroups differ in their  numerical responses to distinct surrounding
              landscape  matrices.  An experimental approach will be followed to test  these
              hypotheses, taking advantage of current landscape  conditions created by
              different land uses.  Sampling units  will be forest fragments within
              anthropogenic matrices and  plots within continuous forests.  A third objective
              will be  to examine the historical change of bird assemblages in the  study
              area following fragmentation.  This will be done by  comparing current species
              composition of the region's forest  to species composition in the region prior
              to fragmentation,  and with the non-fragmented area of study. ***
