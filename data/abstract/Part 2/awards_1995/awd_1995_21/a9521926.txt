Abstract    :
              9521926  Huhndorf   In an ambitious project to study the systematics and
              phylogeny of a large and ecologically important group of ascomycete fungi,
              members of the Sordariales, Dr. Sabine Huhndorf of the Field Museum has
              assembled an impressive team of collaborators and students, both nationally and
              internationally.  They will address several of the major challenges facing
              fungal systematics today, including: (1) examining and testing variation,
              whether environmental or genetic, in key morphological characters used in
              ascomycete taxonomy; (2) integrating sexual and asexual stages of the fungal
              organism, which have often been given different scientific names over the
              years, into phylogenies and classification; (3) stabilizing genus, family, and
              order-level names through a rigorous phylogenetic analysis of morphological and
              molecular (DNA) evidence; (4) assessing species diversity in selected tropical
              regions of Central and South America; and (5) training students at graduate and
              postdoctoral levels in traditional and modern practices of fungal systematics. 
              Taxonomic monographs of two large genera of sordarian fungi, Chaetosphaeria and
              Lasiosphaeria, will be the focus of much of the field work and subsequent
              laboratory and museum study.   The research and training enterprises involve
              colleagues Drs. Greg Mueller and Francois Lutzoni at the Field Museum as well
              as others in Canada, France, and Sweden, and with colleagues in Panama and
              Ecuador.  Students will also participate in ongoing field work in Costa Rica
              and in specialized courses in tropical mycology.  Computerization of specimen
              collections and other computer-assisted activities are enhanced by the Field
              Museum's support for a mycology "gopher" server and other services.
