Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University in the
              purchase of a single-crystal x-ray  diffraction.  This instrument will be used
              to provide structural data critically needed for the  advancement of knowledge
              in five significant chemical research areas:  chiral catalysts, 
              stereochemistry and absolute configuration of new organic compounds and metal
              chelates,  new solid state materials with extended structures,
              fluorinated-imide ion conductors, and  new classes of organometallic compounds
              useful in organic synthesis.    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three-  dimensional structure of
              a molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of all  the bond
              distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
              about  the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
              molecules.
