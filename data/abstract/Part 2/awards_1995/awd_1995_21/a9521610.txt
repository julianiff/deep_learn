Abstract    :
              The sedimentary sequence from lakes containing annual laminations  provides a
              powerful tool for the interpretation of paleoclimate  history.  These sediments
              often contain a high resolutiol record of  paleoclimate and paleoecological
              change.  Lakes containing such a  record are rare in western North America. 
              This SGER award will  focus on the retrieval of a sediment core from a lake
              with  laminated sediments in Yosemite National Park, California.  The 
              successful retrieval of such a core has great potential for linking 
              terrestrial, marine and ecological histories with regional climate  variations
              over the last 15,000 years.***
