Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  Unlike Europe, where the demographic transition went along
              with rapid industrialization, demographic shifts in Latin America appear as the
              result of public health care programs.  Yet there is considerable variation
              among population groups in their use of primary health care programs and this
              study will examine the factors affecting these differences.  The study tests
              demographic theories and social epidemiological theories of health and disease.
               Three Latin American countries will be compared using existing data sources,
              primarily from demographic and health surveys.  %%%   This research will
              contribute to sociological understanding of population changes  and the social
              factors affecting the adoption of public health measures at the household
              level.  Findings will be of use to policy-makers concerned with improving
              public health among households at high risk for disease and early mortality. 
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
