Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.   The study will link theories of employment discrimination based on
              economic outcomes with those based on institutional processes to present a more
              comprehensive picture of the direct and indirect effects of laws on changing
              patterns of employment discrimination.  Analysis is based on civil cases of
              employment discrimination by states using existing and recoded data, newly
              assembled data from histories of state employment discrimination policies, and
              measures of employment inequality using census data.  The time covered is from
              1960 to 1990.  %%%   This study will contribute to sociological understanding
              of the variable affects of anti-discrimination laws on the work experiences of
              women and blacks and add to theory and research in the sociology of law, social
              movements, and social stratification.  The findings will be of use to
              policy-makers concerned with the use of legal means to remedy  discriminatory
              practices.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing
              research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future
              scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
              generation of social scientists.
