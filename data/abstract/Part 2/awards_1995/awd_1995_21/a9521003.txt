Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, is 
              directed towards the renewed study of solvation and retention  mechanisms in
              reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). During  the tenure of this
              eighteen month standard grant, Professor Carr  and his students at the
              University of Minnesota will expand their  research in solvatochromism towards
              the characterization of  separation processes in supercritical fluid and
              micellar systems.  Gas chromatographic stationary phases will be designed with 
              functional groups that participate in hydrogen bonding, acid base,  and dipolar
              interactions with various polar and nonpolar test  solutes. These interactions
              will be quantified using headspace gas  chromatography in conjunction with
              linear solvation energy  relations and Kamlet-Taft solvation parameters. This
              approach will  be applied to the understanding and prediction of analyte
              retention  in supercritical fluid chromatography and micellar electrokinetic 
              capillary chromatography.  Unlike magnetic and optical spectroscopic techniques
              which allow  the calculation and correlation of spectral energy parameters with
               analyte structure, the prediction of retention profiles in reversed  phase
              chromatography is complicated by lack of a definitive theory  which can
              correlate molecular interactions between species in  solution with the
              partitioning of analyte between mobile and  stationary phases. Professor Carr
              and his students at the  University of Minnesota have been leaders in
              development of the  solvatochromic theory, which in concert with empirical 
              chromatographic and spectroscopic measurements, attempts to  quantify retention
              behavior in separation science. These pursuits  will be expanded to the
              characterization of new forms of  chromatography targeted towards environmental
              and industrial  applications.
