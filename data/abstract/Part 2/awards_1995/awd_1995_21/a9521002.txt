Abstract    :
              9521002  Terray       Near-surface turbulence measurements will be conducted in 
              Lake Ontario in collaboration with scientists from the  Canada Centre for
              Inland Waters to study the dependence of  near-surface mixing on wind speed, 
              wave development  and  stability. The anticipated result is the development of
              an  improved understanding of small-scale physical and  biological processes
              that depend on the details of mixing  close to the air-sea interface.  ***
