Abstract    :
              Lelong  OCE-9521275  A  series  of  numerical  studies (using  a 
              pseudo-spectral  model)  will  be  conducted to assess the role  of  vortical 
              motions   in   the  dynamics  of  the  oceanic  fine   scale  variability.  The
              proposed work is divided into four  tasks:  (1)  simulation  of  the breakdown
              of a  near-inertial  wave  packet in a mean shear as a source of
              three-dimensional (3D)  microscale  turbulence; (2) study of  the  generation 
              of  a  nonlinear  component of vortical motion resulting  from  the  decay of a
              3D microscale turbulence event; (3)  study of the  2D  nature of stratified
              turbulence; and, (4) calculation of  an  effective  horizontal diffusivity for 
              a  passive  ocean  tracer in the presence of small scale vortical motions.
