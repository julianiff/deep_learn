Abstract    :
              9521976  Dickson      The goal of this project is to provide a mechanism for the
               quality control of oceanic carbon dioxide measurements that are  made as part
              of a number of international global efforts in which  U.S. scientists
              participate.  Chief among these programs is the  Joint Global Ocean Flux Study,
              which has as one of its primary  objectives the understanding of the directions
              and magnitudes of  carbon dioxide transfer between the Earth's oceans and 
              atmosphere.  The certified laboratories involved in critical  measurements of
              the global carbon dioxide system will produce  high-quality results even though
              they employ different kinds of  analytical instrumentation and analytical
              methodologies.  This  standardization procedure is critical for developing an
              accurate  understanding of the current state of the global carbon cycle, 
              particularly as it impacts global warming and climate change, and  for
              providing a time-independent basis for monitoring changes in  the global carbon
              cycle in the future.  ***
