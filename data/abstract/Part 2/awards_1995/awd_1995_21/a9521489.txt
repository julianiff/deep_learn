Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are fourfold.  New aromatic substrates will be  
              screened for oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida 39/D to broaden the  
              applicability of this method.  Potassium permanganate oxidation of dienes  
              will be investigated as an alternative to ozonolysis.  Syntheses of   sugars,
              cyclitols, sphingolipids and alkaloids will demonstrate the   efficiency of the
              biocatalytic strategy and fourth, mass balance of   reagents and waste output
              will be assessed for each preparation in order   to minimize organic byproducts
              produced during manufacture.  With this Environmentally Benign Chemical
              Synthesis and Processing award,   the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. Tomas   Hudlicky of the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Florida.    Professor Hudlicky, collaborating with Genencor
              International, will focus   his work on developing new strategy for the
              reduction of pollution at its   source.  The strategy rests on the assumption
              that, instead of   incineration or other means of disposal, homogeneous waste
              or solvents   would be subjected to microbial oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida
              39/D to   produce arene cis-diols which are ideally suited for short and  
              environmentally benign conversions to useful organic compounds
