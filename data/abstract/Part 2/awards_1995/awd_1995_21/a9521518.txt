Abstract    :
              9521518  Sandwell       Radar altimeters abroad the Geosat and ERS-1 spacecraft
              have  mapped the marine gravity field over nearly all of the world's  oceans to
              a high accuracy and spatial resolution.  In the  wavelength band 15 to 700 km,
              variations in gravity anomaly are  highly correlated with seafloor topography. 
              Since many southern  ocean areas are sparsely sorveyed these new satellite
              altimeter  data reveal many previously unsurveyed features.  The objectives  of
              this work are to accumulate all available depth soundings, use  the short
              wavelength satellite gravity information to interpolate  between ship
              soundings, extract regional variations in the  topography/gravity transfer
              function and relate them to tectonic  province, and examine variations in
              topography/gravity transfer  function at spreading ridges with regard to
              spreading rate.  ***
