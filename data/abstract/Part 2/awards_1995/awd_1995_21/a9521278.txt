Abstract    :
              9521278   Irani   This faculty internship project builds on an existing
              relationship between the principal investigator and the Minnesota Valley
              Engineering, Inc. Under the existing relationship, Minnesota Valley Engineering
               funded the investigator to undertake a preliminary study to design fabrication
              and machining cells to feed a jumbo pressure vessel assembly shop. In the
              course of the study, it was found that the two most employed algorithms used
              for cell formation, namely, matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering
              proved inadequate for the problem. The study also pointed to the need to
              develop a library of algorithms for use in manufacturing flow analysis. Thus,
              the objective of this internship is to undertake the development of an enhanced
              algorithm for use in cell formation. This algorithm will incorporate the
              strengths of the matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering
              algorithms.  To meet its objective, the project will (1) explore the clustering
              effectiveness and computational benefits of different enhancements, (2) develop
              a core algorithm for material flow analysis that incorporates operation
              sequences, batch quantities, and intercell and intracell flows, (3) develop
              layout design lectures, (4) undertake the development of a technology transfer
              program with local companies interested in cellular manufacturing, and (5)
              create an enhanced version of STORM for teaching students in industrial
              engineering and operations research.    Material flow analysis and improvement
              is at the core of competitive and economic manufacturing. It will reduce the
              cost of material handling  within and between cells or machine stations.
              Additional benefits include reduction in machine setup times, production cycle,
              and work-in-process inventory. Thus, this project is addressing a problem that
              is widespread and one in which many companies stand to gain in several ways if
              an effective solution methodology is found.
