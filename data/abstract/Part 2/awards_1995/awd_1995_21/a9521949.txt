Abstract    :
              9521949  Tieleman  This award is to support the Third International Colloquium 
              on Bluff Body Aerodynamics and Applications (BBAA III) to be  held on July 28 -
              August 1st., 1996 at Virginia Tech  University.  The purpose of the colloquium
              is to broaden the  interaction of engineers and scientists, researchers and 
              practitioners in the fundamental aspects of bluff body  aerodynamics and
              related fields.  These exchanges of  information and knowledge will strongly
              benefit the wind  engineering community since the understanding of the 
              behavior of air flows around structures is fundamental for  estimating their
              response to particular wind loads and for  developing mitigation strategies.
