Abstract    :
                9521778  Ritzwoller    Dr. Ritzwoller will study the shapes of the
              helioseismic spectral lines to deduce key information about large-scale
              aspherical structures, convection, magnetic fields and excitation mechanisms. 
              The line shape interpretation requires separating structural, dynamical and
              excitation effects on mode peaks from the artifacts of data reduction
              techniques and is not entirely straightforward since the seismic effects of
              various excitation mechanisms and solar structures are not yet well understood.
