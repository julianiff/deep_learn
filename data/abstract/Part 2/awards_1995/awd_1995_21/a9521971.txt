Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CHE-9521971 William R. Dolbier  25 September 1995     University of
              Florida      With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor William
              R. Dolbier   of the University of Florida will continue studies of
              fluorine-containing free   radicals.  A variety of experiments will be
              undertaken, some in collaboration with   senior investigators at other
              institutions as well as at Florida. The determination   of absolute rates in
              additions, abstractions, and cyclizations of fluorine-  containing free
              radicals is the major task to be performed.     These experiments will increase
              the understanding of the effect of fluorine as a   substituent in free radical
              chemistry.  The work has industrial significance in that   fluorine compounds
              possess unique and advantageous properties (e.g. Teflon).   Some are articles
              of commerce and these fundamental studies may lead to new   ways of preparing
              such compounds.
