Abstract    :
              EEC-9521984  Nemhauser    This award provides funding for a one year extension
              to capitalize  on the success and help expand the impact to other U.S. 
              manufacturing industries through the Industry/University  Cooperative Research
              Center for Material Handling/Logistics  Institute at Georgia Institute of
              Technology.    The continuing funding will support the basic research program
              in  the Center.  The Center will continue to develop research  activities and
              to advance the state-of-the-art understandings on  Logistics through several
              major core fundamental research  activities:  1) Logistics networks (including
              supply chain,  transportation, and material handling networks); 2) Logistics 
              environments (including urban, rural, and international logistics  and
              ergonomics, and environmental issues of logistics); 3)  Logistics information
              and decision technology (including logistics  information systems and
              computational logistics).  In addition, the  Center will continue to develop
              testbed research projects in  cooperation with its company members to conduct
              the proof-of-  concept implementation and prototyping.    Additional funding is
              provided for a woman undergraduate student to  work on two problems related to
              engineered storage areas:  1)  location assignment for components that should
              be clustered near  specific workstations within a workcenter due to their
              unique  usage, and 2) commonality of usage for a component focus stored in 
              multiple workcenters.
