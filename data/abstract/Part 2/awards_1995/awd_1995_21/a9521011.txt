Abstract    :
                       This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  This study will look at a previously unstudied aspect of
              black-white differences by examining the contributions of total family wealth
              or assets to children's educational attainment and the subsequent contributions
              of children's wealth on the likelihood of forming stable families.   It builds
              on theories of social stratification and uses data from the Panel Study of
              Income Dynamics to statistically model the effects of wealth.  %%%   This study
              will contribute to sociological understanding of differences between blacks and
              whites in family formation and stability and in educational attainment.  Its
              focus on the effects of family assets will also be of use to policy makers
              concerned with stabilizing the family and equalizing opportunity for children. 
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
