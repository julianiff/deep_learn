Abstract    :
              9521184  Duffy    One of  most pervasive and irreversible effects of
              environmental  change wrought by human activity is the reduction in species 
              diversity on local and global scales.  The consequences of  declining for
              ecosystem function remain largely unquantified and  unpredictable.  The loss of
              species in low diversity but high  recruitment environments, like estuaries,
              may severely alter  production levels and trophic transfers.  This research
              will  involve a series of mesocosm experiments to test the effects of 
              invertebrate grazer species on: 1) the structure of eelgrass  communities,
              particularly the algal epiphytes, 2) functional  processes within the eelgrass
              ecosystem, especially primary and  secondary production, vascular detritus
              processing, and organic  matter export to underlying sediment, and 3) the
              responses of the  plants to nutrient enrichment. The results of this work are 
              likely to provide the first experimental evidence about the roles  of
              mesograzers in shallow water vegetation communities, including  their
              individual and collective effects on community structure  and function.    ***
