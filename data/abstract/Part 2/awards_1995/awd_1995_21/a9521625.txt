Abstract    :
              McCormick  9521625    The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the
               seventh Copper Mountain conference on multigrid methods.    Numerical methods
              for solving a differential equation  usually begin by imposing a grid on the
              region where the equation  holds.  From the differential equation, algebraic
              equations are then  developed;  their solution represents the qolution of the
              differential  equation.  The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is
              measured by  the fineness  of the grid.  Multigrid methods are numerical
              methods for solving partial  differential equations that systematically exploit
              the  relationship  between approximate solutions on different grids  to arrive
              at a solution whose accuracy is consistent with the  finest grid  but for
              considerably less work.  The methods are often dramatically more efficient than
              others.  Research in the past dozen years has extended the methods  to a broad
              range of problems of considerable practical import  in engineerine,
              manufacturing, materials, physics, and fluid  dynamics.
