Abstract    :
              9521609  Chow         In the previous project, the Principal Investigator has 
              demonstrated the potential of artificial neural networks to learn  the
              complicated motor fault detection mappings for a single-phase  induction motor
              under constant load conditions.  However, there  are many uncertainty factors
              in the motor operations that can  significantly affect the motor incipient
              fault detection process  and which have not been addressed.  In this proposed
              project, the  Principal Investigators propose to extend the research to cover 
              more realistic operating environments.  The PIs will investigate  different
              factors such as varying load conditions, saturation  effects, temperature
              effects, noise effects, and their influences  on the process of motor incipient
              fault detection for three-phase  induction motors.  In addition, the PIs will
              investigate and  establish a general theory and principle for motor incipient 
              fault detection using a set theoretic formulation.  After setting  up the
              problem in set theoretic formulation, the challenges will  lie in the finding
              of the correct mappings from the appropriate  measurements to the estimation of
              the actual motor faults and  their severity.  The PIs will investigate and
              demonstrate the  advantages and feasibility of the use of neural network and
              fuzzy  logic technologies to obtain the motor fault mapping from  appropriate
              information to yield accurate motor incipient fault  detection in an
              non-invasive, economical, and reliably manner,  along with the ability to
              provide a qualitative and heuristic  explanation of the fault detection
              process.  ***
