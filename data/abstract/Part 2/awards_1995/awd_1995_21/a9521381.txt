Abstract    :
              9521381  Locke  This project is on research to develop and characterize new, 
              nano-structured porous media for improved separations of  biological
              macromolecules by electrophoresis or chromatography.  Hydrogels with tailored
              internal channels or pores having defined  diameters in the range from
              approximately 2 to several nanometers  will be created by using semi-rigid
              rod-like polyions or  amphiphiles (surfactants) that form lyotropic liquid
              crystalline  phases to template the internal structure.  Both isotropic and 
              anisotropic channelized (hence nano-structured) media will be  prepared.  The
              specific aims of this research include: (1)  synthesis of several classes of
              nano-structured hydrogels; (2)  development and application of new methods for
              characterizing the  internal pore structures of hydrogels; (3) measurement of
              size  exclusion limits and transport properties (electrophoretic and 
              diffusive) of molecules within structured and conventional  hydrogels; and (4)
              modeling molecular transport in conventional  and structured gels.  ***
