Abstract    :
              This project investigates the use of non-volatile semiconductor  memory (such as
              flash memory) as a storage system to replace some  of the functions currently
              assigned to disks.  A board (eNVy)  incorporating a large (128MB) flash memory
              is being designed at  Rice University; concurrently, a log-structured file
              system (Rio)  that can use the flash memory board as a cache between main
              memory  and disk is being developed at the University of Michigan.  In  later
              stages of the project these research prototypes will be  integrated.  Research
              issues in hardware development include space  reclamation (garbage collection),
              and tradeoffs between memory  size, performance, and memory lifetimes. 
              Research issues in file  system development include optimization of the sizes
              of cache and  main memory, algorithms for compression of data in the cache, 
              protection of memory from software faults, and exploration of file  system
              index structures.  Integration of the prototypes will  provide insight into the
              protability of these techniques to new  systems.
