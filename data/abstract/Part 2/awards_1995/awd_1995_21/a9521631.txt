Abstract    :
              9521631  Platnick  Ground spiders are among the most abundant and important
              predators in both forest and drier habitats throughout Australia, Tasmania, New
              Caledonia, and New Zealand.  This project will involve a comprehensive survey
              of the Australasian ground spider fauna, resulting in detailed information of
              the characteristics, distributions, and interrelationships of an estimated 650
              species.  %%%  Because these spiders tend to have relatively small distribution
              ranges, the research should enable us to determine the areas within Australasia
              that house the largest numbers of endemic ground spider species, and that may
              therefore be of primary importance for conservation.   The research will also
              enable a detailed analysis of the interrelationships among those areas of
              endemism (thereby providing clues to the phylogenetic history of both forest
              and semi-arid ecosystems within Australia), and will also provide a thorough
              test of the existing higher classification of these spiders, which has been
              based primarily on northern hemisphere species and may require significant
              alteration to accommodate the Australasian faunas.    In addition to the
              taxonomic significance of the project an important aspect will be the training
              of graduate students and postdocs in the field of spider taxonomy. Also,
              specimen data obtained by the research will be made available electronically to
              the scientific community. The host institution is providing as a cost share
              commitment  an artist and a technician to assist with the project.   ***
