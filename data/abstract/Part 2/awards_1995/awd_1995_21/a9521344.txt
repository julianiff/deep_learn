Abstract    :
              9521344  Orcutt       These investigators have collected seismic data within the
               Australian-Antarctic Discordance to measure the crustal thickness  for two
              neighboring segments.  These data will provide a crucial  test of the
              relationship between axial basalt chemistry, crustal  thickness, and axial
              depth since the Discordance is an end-member  in terms of depth for a given
              spreading rate.  This grant will  allow the investigators to finalize the
              analyses of these data.  ***
