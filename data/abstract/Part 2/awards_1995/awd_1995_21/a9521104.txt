Abstract    :
              9521104  COWEN    It  is  widely  appreciated  that  coral  reef  fish  larvae 
              are  transported to reef habitats by ocean currents.  However,  little  is
              known about the behaviors that larval fishes perform to ensure  their  return 
              to  adult habitats.  This  study  will  employ  an  interdisciplinary  approach
              to examine how  circulation  patterns  influence   retention  and  recruitment.
                Specifically,   three-  dimensional  surveys  of  larval  fish 
              distributions,   periodic  monitoring of recruitment and detailed measurements
              of the  water  flow  regime  will be conducted in the vicinity  of  an 
              isolated  island  (Barbados).  Larval fishes will be collected with MOCNESS 
              net  tows.  Local flow and water column structure will be  mapped  with  ADCP,
              CTD, current meters and satellite imagery.  Data from  these tows and
              instruments will provide a basis for understanding  linkages between the intra-
              and interannual variability of  local  flow,  as well as relationships to the
              frequency and duration  of  mesoscale events.    ***
