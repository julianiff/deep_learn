Abstract    :
              9521883  Stotler   Recognizing the need for enhancing taxonomic expertise in the
              study of liverworts (Division Hepaticophyta of the Kingdom Plantae) Profs.
              Raymond Stotler and Barbara Crandall-Stotler of Southern Illinois University
              propose to apprentice students through involvement in a worldwide monograph of
              the "simple thalloid" taxa of the suborder Fossombroniinae of the Metzgeriales.
               A broad program of traditional and modern studies will focus on the several
              hundred species expected to occur within this taxonomic framework, including:
              (1) morphometric analyses with computer imaging systems to assess variability
              in gametophytic and sporophytic features of these small, often epiphyllous
              plants; (2) starch gel electrophoresis of proteins to measure levels of genetic
              variability within and among populations of several species; (3) spore bank
              studies to determine coexisting species assemblages in nature, and to measure
              genetic differences between these co-occurring taxa; (4) DNA sequencing of
              chloroplast and nuclear genes, in cooperation with Prof. Brent Mishler at the
              University of California-@erkeley, to measure mutational differences between
              taxa and construct phylogenies; (5) field work in the U.S. including Puerto
              Rico; and (6) construction of a WorldWide Web link to computer databases on
              hepatics maintained at the institution.   Training of graduate and
              undergraduate students will combine formal course work at the University and in
              tropical sites in Puerto Rico with laboratory and museum studies, including
              studies in Mishler's lab at UC-Berkeley.  Computerization of various
              data-gathering and data-analyzing tasks is fully integrated throughout the five
              years of the project, and will enhance the prompt dissemination of information
              on these moss-like plants.
