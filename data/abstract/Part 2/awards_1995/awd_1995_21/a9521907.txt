Abstract    :
              9521907  Dam    A key problem in oceanographic is understanding the factors that
               effect changes in fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from surface  waters to the
              deep ocean.  It has been recognized that planktonic  organisms play an
              important role in the downward flux of carbon  and nitrogen Zooplankton,
              through their ingestion and subsequent  egestion of phytoplankton and protozoa
              biomass, are important  agents of export production in the ocean.  Although
              rapidly  sinking zooplankton decal pellets have been identified as one of  the
              main mechanisms responsible for downward fluxes of organic,  our knowledge in
              this area remains extremely fragmentary.  This  research centers on the
              transformation by zooplankton of  phytoplankton and protozoa biomass and its
              subsequent export in  the form of fecal pellets, plus the role of zooplankton
              vertical  migration and phytoplankton aggregates in downward fluxes of  carbon
              and nitrogen in the ocean.    ***
