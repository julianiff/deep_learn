Abstract    :
              9521668  Garcia  This proposal is on research to study the synthesis of 
              immobilized soft metal ion systems and the conditions that will  provide the
              capability of reversible, specific binding of biotin  labeled biopolymers and
              cells.  The investigators would develop  paramagnetic beads containing
              immobilized silver or platinum to  be used as aids in DNA manipulations and for
              cell sorting and  recovery.  A second technique to be studied is the
              immobilization  of soft metal ions onto polyacrylamide gel films for cell
              sorting  and enzyme linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA).  Also, a  systematic
              characterization of the two separation techniques by  examining silver loading,
              the chemical nature of the immobilized  silver to detect the presence of
              oxidized silver, and the  chemistry of immobilization is proposed.  ***
