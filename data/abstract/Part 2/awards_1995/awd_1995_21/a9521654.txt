Abstract    :
              9521654  Meroney  This award is for supporting the 2nd. International  Symposium
              on Computational Wind Engineering that will take  place in August 4-8, 1996 at
              the Colorado State University,  Fort Collins, CO.  The purpose of this meeting
              is to examine  the accomplishments and challenges posed by the rapid 
              development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as applied  to the discipline
              of wind engineering.  CFD shows  significant promise as a means to predict,
              estimate and  mitigate the impacts of extreme winds on buildings,  facilities
              and the infrastructure.  The research community,  the private sector and the
              population of wind hazard prone  areas will benefit from these exchanges and
              transfer of  knowledge.  ***
