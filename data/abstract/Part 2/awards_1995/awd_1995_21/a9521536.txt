Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  This is a study of how economic development and competition for
              resources affected the reactions to civil rights protests in the American
              South.  The study draws together theories of economic development and
              competition into a comprehensive explanatory model.  It combines county-level
              event data from 1954 to 1965 with data from government sources and selected
              case studies based on local-level sources.  %%%   This study will add to our
              sociological understanding of how economic factors affect community reactions
              to collective protest.  More generally, it will contribute to understanding the
              dynamics of protest and of resistance to change.  In addition to the scientific
              gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a
              highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. 
              Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the
              thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
