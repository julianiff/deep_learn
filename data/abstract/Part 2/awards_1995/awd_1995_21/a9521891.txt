Abstract    :
              The NBER/Yale Center for Global Change is designed to further the study of
              problems of the environment with particular attention to the international
              dimension, to linking economics and other social sciences, and to bringing
              together American and foreign researchers in the social sciences working on
              human dimensions of global change.  The project will encourage the creation of
              an `invisible college` which encompasses two major elements: (1) it will bring
              together active researchers from U.S. research organizations under the umbrella
              of a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) project; and (2) it will
              generate substantial domestic and international cooperative research through
              conferences and workshops.  These meetings will bring together U.S. and foreign
              researchers under the auspices of Yale University, the NBER, and the
              International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria.  The
              NBER has long served the role of encouraging collaborative research among
              different institutions.  This function is particularly important for research
              in the human dimensions of global change because of its broad scale,
              international scope, and interdisciplinary nature.
