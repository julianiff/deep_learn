Abstract    :
                      The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an  independent,
              nonprofit field station with no institutional  affiliation, which provides
              facilities for researchers who  which to study high-altitude biology in a field
              setting.  Researchers have come to  the RMBL for 68 years, and during  that
              time have patiently put up with inadequate housing and  research facilities. 
              Recent facilities grants from the NSF  have assisted with construction and
              renovation of several  buildings.  This project will support renovation of 
              undergraduate researcher and research assistant housing.  The building for
              which this project will be conducted was  built in 1932 and has been used to
              house up to 10  undergraduate researchers.  Years of winter snow damage have 
              caused structural distress that has been repaired from  season to season, but
              annual reports from a structural  engineer suggest that the safety of the
              building is in  question.  This building is a landmark at the RMBL and has 
              historic value to us.  We will renovate the interior and  exterior to provide
              safe, warm housing for undergraduate  research students.
