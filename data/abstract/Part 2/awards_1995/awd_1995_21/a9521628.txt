Abstract    :
              9521628  Cutter    The photolysis of dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) compounds in
               seawater is a principle source of the radiatively important gas  carbonyl
              sulfur cycle and may be involved in trace metal  complexation since many
              organic sulfur compounds are strong  ligands.  However, no suitable means for
              the detection of DOS in  seawater exists.  Therefore, the overall goal for this
              work is to  adapt an existing reductive pyrolysis method for the determination 
              of DOS in seawater (combustion in a hydrogen atmosphere to hydrogen  sulfide
              and then gas chromatography-flame photometric detection)  and to apply it to an
              initial study of DOS cycling. Specific  objectives for this project are: (1) to
              evaluate the accuracy,  precision, detection limits, and linearity of the
              method; (2) to  test the method in the field and develop appropriate sample
              storage  procedures; and (3) to obtain DOS data for estuarine, coastal, and 
              open ocean waters as an initial survey of its biogeochemical  behavior.  Work
              on this last objective will be in conjunction with  other studies of carbonyl
              sulfide, DOC and DON, and trace metal  complexation in order to allow the
              formulation of specific  hypotheses on DOS biochemistry.
