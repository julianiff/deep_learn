Abstract    :
              9521821  MOORE   Our research asks whether females discriminate among males on
              the basis of the male's ability to withstand stresses during development.  This
              ability is reflected in the degree of fluctuating asymmetry in characters that
              have bilateral expression.  We will use a combination of experimental
              manipulations, genetic experiments, and correlation studies of the cockroach,
              Nauphoeta cinera, to address several issues:  1) is female choice of mates or
              male-male competition influenced by the degree of asymmetry; 2) is the ability
              to reduce asymmetry genetically determined; and 3) do environment and degree of
              inbreeding influence the importance of fluctuating asymmetry?   This research
              will provide information that will help minimize the mating disadvantages of
              individuals reared in biological control and endangered species programs. 
              These programs rely on establishing breeding populations of target species.  To
              be successful we must know how individuals from controlled breeding programs
              fare in competition for mates in a natural habitat.  Many of the practices use
              to rear insects for release in these programs, such as inbreeding, result in
              increased fluctuating asymmetry.  Our research will provide information on how
              mating patterns are affected by female discrimination against the degree of 
              asymmetry.
