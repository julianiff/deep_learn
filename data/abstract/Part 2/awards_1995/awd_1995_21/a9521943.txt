Abstract    :
              9521943  CAIRA   Tapeworms are responsible for human suffering around the globe,
              economic costs for our pets and domestic animals, and fluxes in numerous
              vertebrate wild animal populations.  But their habitat, deep in the organs of
              other animals where they live as parasites, may have led to a general
              out-of-sight-out-of-mind attitude toward the biological diversity of these
              animals.  While a fair amount is known about the biology of a few species that
              are major parasitic pests, general systematic knowledge for this class of
              flatworms is not well developed.  The few systematic specialists who do study
              these parasites include individuals nearing retirement and there is a major
              need for training of new systematic workers in Cestoidea, the tapeworms.  This
              award will support the training and research of three PhD students and several
              undergraduates will be introduced to research in the systematics of these
              animals.  Three of fourteen of orders will receive monographic treatment to the
              species level; databases of these efforts will be developed and made available
              electronically to a wide community of researchers.   The results of this
              research award will contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of
              tapeworms and train new practicing systematists who can carry on further
              research with these parasites and their relatives.  The systematic monographs
              resulting from this research will be of value in basic biological research
              involving the population biology, ecology, biogeography, coevolutionary
              studies, etc. of these parasites, in addition to obvious possible economic
              applicability with human health and the health of domestic animals.
