Abstract    :
              9521227  Messing     This award establishes an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research  Center for Particulate Materials (PMC) at the Pennsylvania State 
              University.  The Center's horizontally-integrated generic research  program
              will benefit a wide range of industries where particle  production, dispersion,
              handling, fabrication of shaped products  from powders are critical processing
              and manufacturing operations.   The research area addressed by the Center
              include:  Particulate  Formation, Grinding and Classification, Colloidal
              Dispersions,  Powder Storage, Flow and Handling, Net Shape Forming, and Press
              and  Sinter Systems.  A Powder Characterization Laboratory is being  developed
              to provide state-of-the-art characterization support for  the research program.
                 Eleven companies involved in a wide range of processing and  manufacturing
              of minerals, food, fertilizers and pesticides, bulk  and specialty chemicals,
              pharmaceuticals, ceramics, and high  technology advanced materials, etc., are
              participating in the  Center.  An Industry Advisory Board (IAB) consisting of
              one  representative from each participating company provides guidance to  the
              Center's research program.  An outside Analyst assists the IAB  in the
              evaluation of the Centers research accomplishments.
