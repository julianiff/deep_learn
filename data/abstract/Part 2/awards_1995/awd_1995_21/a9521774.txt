Abstract    :
              ***  Furick  9521774         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will create algorithms and software to convert legacy paper blueprints
              into electronic forms. At present, there is no seamless way to transfer paper
              blueprints into electronic form. Existing automatic transfer methods often are
              error-prone and fail to capture important semantic content of the drawings.
              Most transfers to electronic form now occur by manually tracing paper
              blueprints into electronic form. This is expensive and unreliable. As a result,
              examination and assessment of existing structures is limited, especially in
              time of crisis or after a failure has occurred. During this Phase II program,
              new algorithms will be created to improve the speed and accuracy of raster to
              vector conversions. A second goal of the program will be to capture this
              geometry and text in knowledge-based object formats. The overall research
              objective is to create frameworks, methods and software that can be used by a
              practicing engineer who is not a computer expert.       This Phase II program
              will permit modern computer based analysis of existing paper blueprints. The
              software developed will have important commercial potential in helping
              earthquake analysis, failure predictions, as well as use in everyday
              translation and storage of archival drawings.
