Abstract    :
              9521444  Nordlander    The objective of this research program is to increase the
               understanding of charge transfer phenomena between atoms and  simple
              molecules, and metal surfaces. The Principal  Investigator will develop and
              apply a dynamical many-body  method, based on Green's functions, in which he
              calculates  the charge transfer probabilities by solving a set of  coupled
              integro-differential equations.  The project  includes an investigation of the
              influence of substrate  temperature, particle velocity, atomic and molecular
              level  degeneracy, substrate band width, and substrate density of  states on
              charge transfer.  The results of this project  provide the theoretical
              background for an accurate  description of charge-transfer processes in
              atom/molecule-  surface collisions.  This formalism helps to interpret 
              specific experimental results and to relate microscopic  properties of the
              surface to actual experimental data.  %%%  This project develops of theory of
              the scattering and  colliding of atoms or molecules with metal surfaces.  The 
              main focus is on the transfer of charge between the surface  and the colliding
              particle.  Part of the project involves  the development of the complex quantum
              theory that one needs  to properly describe these collisions.  The project
              includes  an investigation of the influence of a variety of properties  of both
              the substrate and the colliding particle on charge  transfer.  This formalism
              helps to interpret specific  experimental results and to relate microscopic
              properties of  the surface to actual experimental data.  Such scattering 
              events are a primary way to measure various physical  properties of surfaces,
              the knowledge of which is necessary  to develop new and better materials.  ***
