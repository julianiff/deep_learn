Abstract    :
              9521093  Shanks      The size of an adult population of a marine invertebrate is
              in  part the result of factors affecting the mortality of their  planktonic
              larvae.  In this study the importance of natural  predation to the survival of
              these meroplankton will be assessed  with in situ experiments that seek to test
              three hypotheses: 1)  larval mortality rate varies directly with the
              concentration of  planktonic predators, 2) "background" plankton significantly 
              influences predation rates, and 3) morphology and behavior of  meroplankton
              contribute to interspecific variation in predation  rates.  ***
