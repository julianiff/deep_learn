Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, R. Bruce  
              Weisman of Rice University will use laser pump-probe techniques to  
              investigate the rates at which triplet excited states of molecules   undergo
              vibrational energy relaxation and redistribution, electronic   energy transfer,
              and reaction.  Systems to be studied include triplet   pyrazine and
              methylpyrazine using the rare gases, CO, methane, ethane,   water, and benzene
              as relaxers.  These relaxers span a range of mass,   polarizability, and
              polarity, and will provide information to help   clarify mechanistic
              differences between triplet and ground state   relaxation.  Further studies
              include the triplet decay mechanisms and   kinetics of fullerenes in various
              solvents and in aqueous micelles.  The   fullerenes have been shown to produce
              triplet excimers, and these studies   will determine the equilibrium constant
              for excimer formation and its   variation with solvent and temperature.  Due to
              their unpaired electron spins, triplet state molecules often   exhibit rates of
              reaction and relaxation which are entirely different   from those of the ground
              electronic state.  Professor Weisman's studies   will enhance our understanding
              of these important chemical differences   and will clarify the mechanisms
              involved in excimer formation and   vibrational energy redistribution and
              relaxation.
