Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9521662    The interparticle forces colloidal microstructure and
              rheological properties of two types of stable dispersions of spheres containing
              either polymeric stabilizers grafted to the particles or soluble associative
              three-block co-polymers will be investigated.  Non- equilibrium statistical
              mechanics equations are used to described the colloidal microstructure.  For
              the polymer-stabilized spheres, a new potential of the mean force, hydrodynamic
              functions accounting for the polymer layer and a method for generating the
              equilibrium distribution functions, are proposed.  For the associative
              polymeric suspension, a non-equilibrium interparticles force similar to that in
              reversible network theories will be introduced in analysis.    The proposed
              work has relevance to rheological characterization of polymer-stabilized
              suspensions, with  particular relevance to advanced materials processing
              coatings.  ***
