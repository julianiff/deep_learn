Abstract    :
                 9521507 Menendez   This research aims, using advanced Raman scattering
              capabilities, to understand details of growth phenomena affecting disorder at
              GaAs/AlAs superlattice(SL) interfaces, and interface chemistry and physics
              relationships to III-V SL optoelectronic properties.  This approach will be
              used to study basic chemical and physical processes that produce disorder at
              heterojunction during growth.  In addition, the vibrational and electronic
              properties of ultrasmall structures and the stresses in semiconductor devices
              will be further investigated. The project also includes modeling and simulation
              to predict phonon frequencies in complex materials for comparison and
              interpretation of experimental results. %%% An advanced laser light scattering
              with computer simulation has recently been developed and will be used for basic
              research of chemical and physical properties of ultrasmall structures, and
              heterojunction interfaces. This project will be important for advances in
              microelectronics and photonics because progress in the miniaturization of
              semiconductor devices depends on the availability of material structures whose
              crystalline and chemical properties can be controlled at the atomic level. 
              Additionally, an important feature of the program is the training of graduate
              and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant
              area. ***
