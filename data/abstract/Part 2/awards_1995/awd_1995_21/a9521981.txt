Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9521981    It is proposed to provide partial travel support to a
              group of academic researchers to participate and present papers at the
              conference entitled "Frontiers in Industrial Process Tompography", to be held
              10/30 to 11/38/1995 in San Louis Obis, CA.  About 60 papers andsix invited
              lectures from several countries will be presented.  The meeting is a timely
              forum for the latest scientific and technological development in process
              tomography, an emerging field of  research.    Application of  Process
              Tomgraphy plays a critical role in process design and control in chemical,
              agricultural, pharmaceutical, mineral processing, energy, and environmental
              industries.  The conference aims to disseminate new findings and to identify
              future direction of research.    The meeting is co-sponsored by industry and
              Engineering Foundation.  ***
