Abstract    :
              9521113  Parmentier    The Dynamics of Mid-Ocean Ridges    Parmentier and
              Forsyth will continue examining processes at mid-  ocean ridges through
              computer modeling. The models start with  simple observations such as: ridges
              are broken into segments of  different length. The computer models use measured
              and estimated  physical properties of the mantle such as viscosity and 
              temperature, and hypotheses about how the mantle will behave to  calculate what
              the length of the ridge segments should be and what  parameters affect this
              length. The results of the models can point  to features on the sea floor that
              can be measured that will confirm  alternate model outcomes. The work will lead
              to a better  understanding of the properties the mantle.
