Abstract    :
                  9521479  Pepperberg    With this "Small Grant for Exploratory Research ," a
              group  headed by Dr. Irene Pepperberg will conduct new studies on  how the
              brain controls vocalization.  The work will involve  a unique model system --
              parrots that have been taught  English utterances.    Most of the existing
              knowledge on the neural control of bird  song comes from passerine songbirds
              such as canaries and  finches.  In order to study how other types of birds
              control  vocalization, the Pepperberg group has turned to parrots.  When
              parrots are taught English phrases, they form them into  song-like utterances
              and this offers the unique opportunity  to study vocal behaviors that are
              similar to those of the  well-known songbirds.  In order to understand how the
              brain  controls this behavior, the activity of various regions of  the brain 
              will be changed in a reversible manner while song  is being attempted.  This
              should provide information on  whether or not different groups of birds use
              different brain  mechanisms to produce song.  These studies will influence  our
              understanding of brain evolution, the neural control of  motor behavior, and
              the emergence of cognitive capacities  within animals.  ***
