Abstract    :
              This proposal will study the morphology and temperature structure of the source
              regions of solar wind, which are vital for understanding mechanisms that drive
              this plasma flow.  The PI will make images of the Sun in spectral lines during
              the unique coronal observing conditions provided by total solar eclipse.  Four
              CCD cameras will simultaneously observe the solar corona; in addition, the PI
              will observe white light from the continuum measurements in all four filters. 
              With this set of spectral lines, the PI will identify the spatial relationship
              between the cool material forming the bulk of coronal holes, and the hot
              material from the surrounding regions that often veil them.  These observations
              should also resolve spatial distribution of different temperature plasmas
              within polar coronal holes.  With the CCD cameras, the PI will provide the
              first simultaneous photometric images of coronal holes in these spectral lines.
               This research will ultimately establish a new tool for exploring the structure
              of coronal holes.
