Abstract    :
              9521150  Chang  This  award  is  made  under  the Small  Grants  for 
              Exploratory  Research  program  to  collect data on  the  economic  impact  of 
              lifeline  disruption  in  the January 17,  1995  Hyogo-ken  Nambu  earthquake

              on lifeline systems and economic  activity  in  the Kobe region; lifeline
              damage and restoration information;  direct   and  indirect  indicators  of 
              post-earthquake  economic  activity;  and  case  study information on  economic
               impact  and  recovery.    Information  will  be  collected   in   Japan   from
               transportation   and  utility  companies,  government   agencies,  university 
              researchers, media sources, and personal  interviews.  The  project  will  be
              coordinated with the comprehensive  multi-  disciplinary research program on
              this earthquake being undertaken  at   the   Disaster  Prevention  Research 
              Institute   of   Kyoto  University.  ***
