Abstract    :
              9521691  Trueb  This research involves resolution of relationships of fossil and
              Recent frogs in several basal lineages.  In addition, there are several ancient
              frog fossils that have been discovered recently and that are undescribed. It is
              probable that these fossils will provide insights on the broader problem of
              basal frog relationships and biogeographic history. Recent attempts to resolve
              frog systematics using living taxa have been unsatisfactory and inclusion of
              data from the fossil record has been thwarted by poor descriptions and lack of
              coordinated collaborative efforts between neontologists and paleontologists.
              This project will address this problem and involve the collaborative research
              efforts of the PI, a South American collaborator and three students.   %%%  The
              significance of the research on basal frog lineages is that it will provide the
              framework necessary for unraveling relationships among later diverging frogs
              and allow a more comprehensive understanding of frog taxonomy, relationships
              and biogeography.   ***
