Abstract    :
              9521258  Kastner       Kastner will develop Nd isotopes in marine barite to
              trace  fluctuations of water masses.  This technique should be useful in 
              understanding the development of water masses and their movement  during
              glacial-interglacial cycles.  This research should also  lead to an
              understanding of what depth barite forms in the water,  which has been a puzzle
              for some time.  This is important because  barite in sediments has been used to
              indicate the productivity of  the surface waters.  ***
