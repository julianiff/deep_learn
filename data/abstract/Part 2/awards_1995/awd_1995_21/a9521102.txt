Abstract    :
              9521102  Garvine  In this project, the PIs will conduct an observational study
              of  coastal upwelling circulation on a wide continental shelf -- the 
              mid-Atlantic Bight off New Jersey.  The objectives are:  1.  To  resolve the
              mass balance, as to whether it is two or three-  dimensional;  2.  To determine
              the primary subsurface across-shelf  transport pathway and the dynamical
              importance of along-shelf  pressure gradient;  3.  To determine criteria for
              formation of an  upwelling front, and find its role in the mass and heat
              fluxes;  4.   To determine where the zone of maxiumum upwelling occurs; and, 5.
                To find the principal terms in the heat budget.  A variety of  moored and
              ship-board instruments, and satellite-tracked drifters,  as well as satellite
              imagery of temperature and color will be used.
