Abstract    :
              9521827  Mittal  A Conference on Combustion, Environment, and Heating Technology
              - The Role of High Performance Simulation will be organized by the Ohio
              Supercomputing Center (OSC) in 1995.  The OSC has organized a series of
              meetings focusing on combustion sine 1991.  The primary purpose of these
              meetings has been to identify the needs of industry and the challenges it
              faces, to explore the role of high performance computing and simulation in the
              design and analysis of new combustion systems, and to promote better
              understanding  of combustion science.    The 1995 meeting will be held at the
              Ohio State University during the Fall of 1995 with a special focus on
              environmental consequences of combustion process.
