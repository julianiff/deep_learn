Abstract    :
              9521050  Newman       This grant is to provide partial support to the
              Seismological  Society of America for preparation of a special issue of the 
              Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America devoted to the  January 17,
              1994 Northridge, California, M=6.7 earthquake.   Professor Keiiti Aki, Science
              Director of the Southern California  Earthquake Center, will be the special
              editor for this series of  papers.  The issue will appear in February, 1996. 
              The Northridge  earthquake is the most costly natural disaster to strike the
              United  States even though the size of the earthquake is not particularly 
              large when compared to recent earthquakes that have struck the U.S.  or other
              regions in the world.  However, this earthquake occurred  in a highly urbanized
              area.  It also occurred in an area that is  well instrumented for
              seismological, geodetic, geophysical and  engineering post-earthquake studies. 
              This issue of the BSSA will  provide the scientific and engineering communities
              a timely  framework for the data, analysis and conclusions regarding the 
              Northridge earthquake.  This project is a component of the National  Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
