               connection to the Internet through the SURAnet regional network.    SURAnet is
              the regional network located in the state of Tennessee  that will provide
              operations and network information services.  It  will provide the Southern
              College of Optometry with a connection to  the Internet, a collection of
              interoperable networks that connect  most research and education organizations
              in the United States.    The college needs the Internet connection to be able
              to access  information resources throughout the state, the nation nd the 
              world.  The connection will benefit the students, faculty and staff  of the
              Southern College of Optometry.
