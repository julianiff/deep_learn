Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new catalysts for
              enantioselective reactions.  Chiral phosphines and chiral derivatives of
              dimethylaminopyridine will be evaluated as enantioselective acylation
              catalysts, as well as sulfonation and phosphorylation catalysts.  The emphasis
              will be on reagents that can be used under conditions of cooperative catalysis.
               Procedures that allow simultaneous catalysis by a chiral nucleophile and by a
              Lewis acid will be investigated, and amplification of selectivity via
              sequential stages involving chiral catalysts will be explored.  Techniques that
              provide rapid access to chiral phosphines will be studied, including
              enantioselective protonation of phosphorous-stabilized anions, use of
              inexpensive chiral subunits that allow synthesis of enantiomerically pure
              phosphines via diastereomer separation, and asymmetric transformation
              techniques.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Edwin Vedejs of the Department of Chemistry at the University
              of Wisconsin.  Professor Vedejs will focus his work on the development of
              practical catalysts for the preparation of chiral substances in
              enantiomerically pure form which is of great importance in the synthesis of
              compounds of biological and industrial interest.  Emphasis will be placed on
              main group reagents, such as phosphorus and nitrogen-based reagents, and
              non-toxic metal ions to minimize disposal problems in potentially large scale
              applications.
