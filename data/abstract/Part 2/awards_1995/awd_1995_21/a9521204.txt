Abstract    :
              9521204  Kovacs  The proposal is focused on the problem of fluid flow in
              microvalve MEMs.  The research uses rapid deep RIE (DRIE) of silicon combined
              with silicon fusion bonding (SFB) to offer unique mechanical structures with
              particular advantages to the field of microfluidics.  These novel techniques
              can be combined with a monomorph thermal actuator to fabricate novel microvalve
              structures which are able to control fluids in MEMs.  The application of these
              MEMs is in the area of high-performance liquid chromatography systems.  ***
