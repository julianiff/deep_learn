Abstract    :
              Gerber/Abstract            The objectives of this research are two-fold;  (1) to
              analyze existing  observations of cloud liquid water using a new optical device
              (PVM-100A) capable  of high frequency sampling (2KHz), including the direct
              measurement of   effective  radius  (volume divided by surface area).  The high
              frequency measurements of  liquid water (in Cumulus and stratorcumulus clouds)
              should illuminate the physics of  entrainment;  the effective radius seems to
              be a useful variable for radiative transfer  and remote sensing applications; 
              (2) to participate in a field experiment (SHEBA)  devoted to the cloud physics
              of (summer) Arctic stratus, a cooperative program
