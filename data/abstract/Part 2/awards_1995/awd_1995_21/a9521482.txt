Abstract    :
              9504091  Steinfeld      This U.S.-Argentina award is for a planning visit by Dr.
               Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of MIT to go to Instituto de Quimica  Fisica de los
              Materiales, Medio Ambiente, y Energia  (INQUIMAE) to develop an MIT-INQUIMAE
              workshop to be held in  March 1996, to lay the groundwork for future
              collaboration  and to set up meetings with a number of other Argentine 
              organizations who are engaged in developing links with MIT  teaching and
              research programs.  Steinfeld administers an  NSF Training Grant "Chemistry in
              the Environment" which  involves faculty in toxicology, physical and inorganic 
              chemistry.  Argentina would like to develop a collaboration  with MIT which
              would enable them to train their scientists  in environmental science and
              technology. ***
