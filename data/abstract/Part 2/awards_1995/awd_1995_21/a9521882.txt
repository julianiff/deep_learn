Abstract    :
              9521882  Stoermer   For a large, diverse, and ecologically important group of
              aquatic microorganisms, the algal diatoms, taxonomic expertise is limited in
              the United States, and only a few institutions host major natural history
              collections that facilitate research and training.  Dr. Eugene Stoermer of the
              University of Michigan supervises one of the major laboratories devoted to the
              study of diatoms, with emphasis on the species-rich flora of Great Lakes
              diatoms (estimated at 2000 species) and their taxonomic relatives in North
              America and abroad.  He has been a pioneer in the application of
              computer-assisted morphometric analyses to the study of size and shape in
              diatoms, and to related problems of their growth, geographic distribution and
              dispersal, ecological coexistence, fossilization and geological persistence,
              and evolutionary relationships.  For the next five years he and his colleagues
              and students will be engaged in the study of the Great Lakes diatoms and their
              worldwide relatives, with the goals of clarifying taxonomic relationships at
              species, genus, and family ranks; constructing reliable identification keys
              based on features not subject to environmental modification during the growth
              of diatoms; constructing hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among
              selected groups of diatoms, and integrating these inferences with data from the
              fossil record; and databasing records of natural history collections of
              diatoms, at University of Michigan and in other major collections.   Under the
              PEET program, the research includes training of new diatom taxonomic experts,
              at graduate and postdoctoral levels over the five years.  Colleagues at the
              California Academy of Sciences and the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences
              are cooperating in the research and training.  In addition, Dr. Stoermer and
              his students will participate annually in the diatom courses offered at the
              Iowa Lakeside Laboratory, a popular venue for summer field courses in diatom
              studies.  Results of research and of specimen  databasing activities are to be
              made readily accessible electronically over Internet, and with a WorldWide Web
              page devoted to diatom systematics, evolution and ecology.
