Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  The research will study career and family patterns of female
              executives in finance-related fields.  Existing theories explaining why women
              make up a small proportion of higher management are reconsidered through an
              approach that takes into account the combination of events that make up turning
              points in women's lives.  These turning points either sustain women in a career
              trajectory or redirect them in other directions.   Detailed interviews from 58
              senior female executives and 23 women who began promising careers in the same
              field but did not continue at the same pace or left entirely will be analyzed
              using optimal matching techniques, a form of sequence analysis.  %%%   This
              research will contribute to sociological understanding of the interrelations
              among work, family, and gender equality.  Innovative methods of analysis will
              be refined so that they can be of use to social scientists studying career
              mobility.  Findings will also be helpful to policy-makers concerned with ways
              to increase equality in the work place and to strengthen family relations.  In
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
