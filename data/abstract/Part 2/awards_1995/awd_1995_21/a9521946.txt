Abstract    :
              9521946  Hallas  Edison Community College requests support from NSF for
              connection  of their Charlotte County Campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet, a 
              midlevel network will provide operations management and information  services
              and it will give the Edison's Charlote County Campus a  128KB connection to the
              Internet connection, a collection of  interoperable networks that connect most
              research and education  organizations in the United States.    The College
              needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information resources
              throughtout the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff students of  Edison Commmunity College Charlotte County
              campus.
