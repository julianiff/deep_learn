Abstract    :
              9521653  Naomi  In July 1994, a national workshop addressing Research on
              Advanced  Composites in Construction (RACC) was held in Washington, DC  under
              NSF sponsorship.  This workshop was a planned activity  aimed at integrating
              specific research tasks dealing with  characterization, manufacturing, testing
              procedures, standards,  and analysis/design criteria relative to the use of
              advanced  composites materials in construction.  It is important that this 
              type of activity be expanded to the international level to make  government
              funding agencies aware of the needs and progress in  this area of research and
              development, to seek new forms of  international collaboration, to address
              international  standardization and coding issues, and to allow researchers to 
              review national priorities in light of international  achievements.    A
              conference/workshop on International Research on Advanced  Composites in
              Construction will be held in Bologna, Italy, during  the Spring of 1996
              addressing the following five areas:  non-  prestressed reinforcement for
              concrete; prestressed reinforcement  for concrete and cables; structural
              shapes; structural FRP  systems; and repair systems.  Technical experts from
              Europe,  Japan, and the Americas will be invited to this activity.  The  U.S.>
              delegation will consists of ten researchers Central and  South America will be
              represented by five researchers.  Managers  of national and international
              funding agencies will also be  invited.    Conference/workshop presentations
              and recommendation on the  program will be collected in a document for
              distribution to  universities, professional societies, industry, and
              government.  ***
