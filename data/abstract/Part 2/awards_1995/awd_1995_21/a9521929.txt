Abstract    :
              9521929    Nabelek    The recent establishment of a braodband seismograph
              network along  the cost of the Pacific northwest and the availability of data 
              from the Navy's offshore hydrophone arrays (SOSUS) provide a  framework for
              long-term monitoring of the seismicity associated  with the Juan de Fuca plate
              and the surrounding ridge-transform  system.  This project will use the onshore
              seismograph network to  determine magnitudes, depths, source mechanisms, and
              time  histories of earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.0 or greater and  will
              incorporate epicentral locations from the SOSUS arrays  determined by NOAA.
