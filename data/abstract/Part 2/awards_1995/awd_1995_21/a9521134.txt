Abstract    :
              9521134  Sanford      This ocean sciences instrumentation development project
              involves a feasibility study to determine  how to best implement electric field
              measurements to derive ocean transport and velocity profile  observations from
              a modified ALACE float.  The proposed Motional Induction Transport  Explorer
              (MITE) is an ALACE float modified by the addition of a compass, electrode arms,
               amplifiers and new software.  At present, ALACE floats can provide month-long
              displacements  and conductivity weight flow averages.  The modifications would
              also provide a measure of  shear versus rise, and provide an estimate of
              short-term fluctuations of the float trajectory and  record velocity profiles. 
              If successful, MITE would have a number of applications in the  physical
              oceanographic studies of the world's oceans.
