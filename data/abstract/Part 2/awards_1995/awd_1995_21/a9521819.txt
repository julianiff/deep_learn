Abstract    :
              9521819  FAUTIN   Sea anemones are important members of marine ecosystems.  They
              occur at all depths, from deep-sea vents to coral reefs, where they can
              displace or replace hard corals under some conditions.  In fact, studies of
              anemones in this latter context are important for understanding the effects of
              global change on corals and coral reefs.  Dr. Fautin is one of only five
              systematists in the world dealing with sea anemones and she is the only one in
              North America.  She will remedy this situation by training one MS student, two
              PhD students and a post-doctoral fellow.  A database of anemones of the world
              will be developed, including digitized images of species and electronic keys
              that can be utilized by non-systematists as well as systematic researchers. 
              Both morphological and molecular data will be utilized in the monographic
              treatment of these organisms.   This award will support the training of new
              practicing systematists dealing with sea anemones.  Our knowledge of this
              neglected element of marine biodiversity will be markedly increased and the
              information resulting from this project should be of use to researchers
              studying marine community ecology, population biology, global change,
              biogeography, etc..  Knowledge of relationships among species for this group
              has potential economic value as well, since sea anemones have been a focus of
              research involving bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals, such as anesthetics.
