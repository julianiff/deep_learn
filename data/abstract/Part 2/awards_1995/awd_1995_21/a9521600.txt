Abstract    :
              9521600  Harris    This Minority Research Planning Grant seeks to explore the 
              concept of racial group consciousness as a source of collective  action in
              three western-style democracies.  It seeks to examine  how racial exclusion and
              inequality in the United States, United  Kingdom, and South Africa are and have
              been resisted by racially  excluded groups through organized efforts.  A
              comparative  perspective on black political mobilization will also illuminate 
              the strategies and tactics racially excluded groups adopt to  resist systems of
              domination in their societies.  In doing so, it  will explore how citizenship
              and the notion of "race" have been  historically formulated and contested by
              both dominated groups  and state actors.  By drawing on empirical data
              collected from  opinion surveys, interviews, and methods of ethnography and 
              participant observation, this approach to black political  mobilization will
              provide a broader understanding of the  political formation of racial group
              consciousness than existing  research.  A comparative perspective on race,
              state, and  democracy will also inform researchers on how liberal democracies 
              and their citizens respond to racial conflict and inequalities.  ***
