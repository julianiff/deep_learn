Abstract    :
              9521493  McCord  The purpose of this project is to prove the worth of
              presently-classified satellite-sensing data bases for research on volcanoes,
              with the ultimate goal of getting them declassified so they will be available
              to all scientists who could use them.  Th. PI will work with the classified
              material on Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, which is well studied already, and see how
              it compares with the known work.  After the material is declassified, his
              results will be published, and the volcanological community will be able to
              determine how useful the entire data base might be.
