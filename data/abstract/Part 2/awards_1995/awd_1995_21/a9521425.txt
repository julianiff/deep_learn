Abstract    :
              9521425  Liapis  This research program will investigate the potential 
              effectiveness of flexible inflatable structures as breakwaters.  Their
              geometry, flexibility and damping characteristics would be  utilized to reflect
              or dissipate a significant amount of the wave  energy.  Two basic cases will be
              considered:  Case  I, in which  the structure is inflated with air and is
              moored to the sea bed  using tethers, and Case II, in which the structure is
              filled with  water and is anchored directly to the sea bed.    The
              investigation will involve analytical, numerical, and  experimental work to
              study this complex fluid-interaction  problem.  The effects of many parameters
              will be examined, such  as the wave height and frequency, the structural
              dimensions and  material properties, the internal pressure or head, the tether 
              lengths, orientations, and material properties (for Case I), and  the anchoring
              forces (for Case II). Optimal combinations of the  system parameters will be
              sought, to furnish the most effective  wave barrier.  ***
