Abstract    :
              9521755  Ashe  The rove beetle (family Staphylinidae) subfamily Aleocharinae,
              which currently comprise over 900 genera and 12, 000 species throughout the
              world, is currently the most taxonomically difficult large group of beetles
              (Coleoptera).  However, aleocharines are abundant, and often dominant,
              components of the biological diversity of many microhabitats in both temperate
              and tropical regions throughout the world, and their abundance and diversity
              suggests that they may have substantial ecological impact. Aleocharines have
              diversified along many evolutionary pathways and offer outstanding
              opportunities for addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary biology and
              about the origin and modification of behavior, ecological associations, and
              their roles in ecosystem structure and function and patterns of biological
              diversity. The ability to address these issues is hampered by the inability of
              even the most experienced staphylinid worker to identify genera and higher taxa
              of aleocharines and the virtual lack of information about evolutionary
              relationships of aleocharines, especially at higher taxonomic levels. To
              address these problems, and to provide for training of the next generation of
              systematists, this project will: 1) provide comprehensive training for a
              Postdoctoral associate, and two graduate students, 2) provide identification
              guides to the genera od Aleocharinae of North America and Mexico, 3) make the
              character and image database available on-line through an Internet connection
              and 4) produce an analysis of evolutionary relationships of the higher taxa of
              basal lineages of aleocharines.   %%%  The project's outlines will provide
              access to basic systematics and basal phylogeny that could encourage additional
              research on the wide variety of aleocharine systematics, evolution and ecology,
              and the role that these beetles play in ecosystem structure and function, that
              previously could not be addressed. The training aspects will produce
              knowledgeable specialists in the Staphylinidae, as  well as excellent modern
              systematists that will be highly competitive for future positions.   ***
