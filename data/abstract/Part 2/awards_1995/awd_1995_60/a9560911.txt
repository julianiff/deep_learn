Abstract    :
              9560911  Pirzada       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate and develop fire suppression technology. The focus
              will be on structures located in environments where water can be as damaging as
              the fire, and typical chemical suppression systems is hazardous to occupant
              health or is polluting to the environment Phase I will demonstrate the
              proof-of-concept.  If approved, Phase II will optimize and field test the novel
              technology, while Phase III will commercialize the technology.       The
              proposed innovation can lead to fire suppression technology for structures
              where water and conventional chernical suppressants are unsuitable.
              Furthermore, the proposed technology can help reduce billions of dollars that
              is lost every year in fire and intangibles associated with the property. The
              technology also has applications in growing applications such as fire
              suppression for microelectronics products.
