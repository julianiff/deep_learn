Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will
              analyze and design a wideband wireless network for the transmission of
              transaction traffic, file traffic and digital voice traffic.  Multiple access
              protocols are used to permit independent transmitters to share a single
              communication channel. When the number of transmitters is large or when the
              duty cycle of individual transmitters is small a random access multiple access
              protocol is usually required. Spread ALOHA is a new random access protocol
              which can operate at a data rate 50 or more times that of conventional
              protocols.    Spread ALOHA uses a single spreading code to transmit signals
              from an unlimited number of remote transmitters. In this research project it is
              planned to analyze and design an improved form of Spread ALOHA which uses two
              codes rather than one for all transmitters. By means of the second code it is
              possible to greatly increase the throughput in wideband wireless networks with
              significant amounts of file and voice traffic.       This research can be used
              to build less expensive, more efficient personal communication services (PCS)
              networks integrating transaction traffic, file traffic and digital voice
              traffic.
