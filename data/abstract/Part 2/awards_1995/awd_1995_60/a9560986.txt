Abstract    :
              9560986  Sapienza         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project addresses a pollution prevention problem in the existing commercial
              synthesis of isocyanates. The manufacture of these important raw materials for
              the manufacture of polyurethane entails the hydrogen reduction of a
              nitroaromatic compound to the corresponding amine and its subsequent reaction
              with phosgene to the urethane monomer. This process represents the primary use
              of phosgene in which over eighty-five percent of the world's output is
              consumed. The demand for this chemistry continues to grow due to the properties
              of the polyurethanes, but the toxic hazard of phosgene has created difficulties
              in plant location approvals. This project will investigate an alternative
              chemical synthesis that bypasses the toxic feedstock by directly reducing and
              carbonylating the nitroaromatic using an alkaline promoted homogeneous metal
              carbonyl catalyst system. Systems derived from homogeneous water-gas-shift
              catalysts in alcohol-water solutions of alkaline salts and amines will be
              investigated under various conditions of temperature and carbon monoxide
              pressure.         Direct carbonylation of the aromatic nitro compounds offers
              an attractive commercial alternative to synthesize isocyanates and urethanes
              which avoids the use of large quantities of hydrogen and the need for expensive
              and toxic phosgene. This nonphosgene preparation is needed by industry because
              restrictions involving chlorine and phosgene are being increasingly enforced.
