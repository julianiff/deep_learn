Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              investigates a Computer Aided Failure Analysis System (CAFES) for rapid
              diagnosis of yield loss for digital VLSI circuits.  Such a system is needed to
              accelerate the yield learning for semiconductor fabrication facilities.
              Traditional approaches to yield learning involve diagnosing the faulty
              component, and subsequently determining the underlying contaminant through
              costly and time-consuming physical failure analysis techniques.  Turnaround
              time to obtain a statistically meaningful sample of contaminants slows yield
              learning.  The rapid failure analysis research methodology of this Phase I
              combines traditional defect localization with automatic defect classification
              techniques.  These automatic techniques directly relate circuit malfunctions to
              possible contaminants, thereby alleviating the requirement for physical failure
              analysis methods. This is accomplished through off-line characterization of the
              faulty device and augmented cell library information which catalogs the
              possible faulty behaviors of the device.  The research will study required
              algorithms and write a prototype code to establish the accuracy and resolution
              which this scheme can attain.       Reducing the time required to achieve
              profitable yields will increase profitability.  The cost benefits of CAFES are
              important in the face of mounting costs of semiconductor fabrication
              facilities.  Rapid yield learning is one of the important options for
              enhancement of competitive advantage in the semiconductor manufacturering
              industry.
