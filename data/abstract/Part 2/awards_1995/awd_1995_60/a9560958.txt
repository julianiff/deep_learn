Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of applying advanced nonlinear fringe tracking algorithms to
              enable astronomers to track dimmer stars.  Ground based stellar optical
              interferometers are limited in the amount of sky coverage achievable by the
              lack of stars bright enough to serve as guide stars.  This problem cannot be
              solved by Adaptive Optics (AO) means alone.  The fringe tracking subsystem has
              been identified as the performance limiting subsystem for optical
              interferometric arrays.  State-of-the-art data processing algorithms utilized
              for fringe tracking functions use linear correlation filters and make limited
              use of atmospheric turbulence information.  This situation presents an
              opportunity for advanced fringe tracking algorithms that make use of all the
              available statistical information and can naturally handle the measurement
              nonlinearities.  The proposed algorithms have the additional advantage of being
              complementary to AO systems.  The goal of the Phase I effort is to establish
              the possibility of coherent tracking with reduced signal-to-noise requirements
              through the use of advanced algorithms, and thus to enable the observation of
              dimmer (by about one bolometric magnitude) target stars.       The resulting
              software product would be invaluable for current and planned interferometric
              arrays world-wide, both military and scientific.  This technology would also be
              of use to optics manufacturing houses with a need for interferometric metrology
              testing of precision surfaces for large optical components.
