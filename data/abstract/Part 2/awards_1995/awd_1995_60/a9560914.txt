Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Innovation Phase I project will synthesize
              materials with negative birefringence which can be used to decrease the
              birefringence of LC mixtures. This will allow the firm to make thicker cells
              which will increase the yields and minimize display problems due to minor
              variances in cell thickness.  The birefringence of liquid crystals generally
              falls with increasing wavelength (a property called birefringence dispersion),
              but the optimal birefringence for a fixed path length rises with increasing
              wavelength. This leads to chromatic behavior in LC displays. We furthermore
              propose to synthesize LC materials with negative birefringence dispersion,
              which can be used to greatly decrease the chromicity of LC displays.  There are
              many immediate ramifications of developing a liquid crystal with negative
              birefringence dispersion. For instance, liquid crystal shutters would no longer
              suffer from such severe chromatic disturbances, optical filters would be much
              more color-balanced and provide more free spectral range, polarization
              interference filters would need fewer stages and hence be less expensive while
              transmitting more light, and Fabry-Perot tunable filters could be made using
              liquid crystal SLI\Is.  Liquid Crystal shutters without chromatic disturbances,
              optical filters more color balanced and have more spectral range, benefits to
              polarization interference filters, make Fabry-Perot tunable filters using
              liquid crystal SLM's.
