Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at
              developing a new head mounted display in which a stereo pair of images is
              propagated by total internal reflection inside a visor or lens. The proposed
              technology provides a new method for projecting an image, in which a guided
              light wave propagates entirely within a thin transparent plate, exiting to
              travel directly to the eye of the user. The source of the image will be a row
              of light-emitting diodes mounted at the edge of the plate outside the range of
              vision of the user. The device will be transparent like ordinary eyeglasses,
              permitting the user to see through the displayed image if necessary. The new
              guided-wave head mounted display will be a major improvement over currently
              available systems, which are too bulky because all of them depend upon the
              propagation of light through a volume of space. If successful, the proposed
              Phase I effort will lead to extremely compact systems which display computer
              generated imagery or remotely sensed visual data in three dimensions.       The
              proposed technology can be used to make large flat panel displays and 2D or 3D
              eye glass displays. The technology is likely to find wide use as a primary
              display device for small notebook computers, virtual reality games, augmented
              reality systems for military and medical applications, heads-up displays for
              aircraft and automobiles, and telerobotics systems.
