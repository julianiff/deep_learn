Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a
              novel hybrid steam-plasma (HSP) torch that has broad application for advanced
              materials synthesis, chemical conversion, waste redemption, coating deposition,
              and gasification.  The research objectives aim at a prototype HSP torch and
              focus on demonstrating its application in plasma spray operations.  The
              demonstration focuses on reliability and ease of use in an industrial
              environment.       The Phase I research will address issues like requirements
              for a durable electrode material for the steam-plasma environment.  Plasma
              spraying is expected to have a large market potential.  Phase II is planned to
              include detailed evaluations on the metallurgical nature of the sprayed metal
              and of its bonding characteristics with substrates.       Use of the HSP torch
              is expected to improve process productivity and open new applications for
              plasma spray technology.  As a generic processing tool, it may open a broad
              range of chemical processing applications.  These include nano-powered
              synthesis, conversion of methane to acetylene, and gasification of black liquor
              in the pulp industry.  A significant market for this technology may be found in
              the treatment of hazardous chemical and biological agents, including CFC's,
              PCB's, and other toxic or carcinogenic substances.
