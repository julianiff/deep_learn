Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will adapt the
              proprietary Multi Photon Detection (MPD) technology to high performance liquid
              chromatography (HPLC) techniques, thereby significantly improving the detection
              limits of HPLC. Current HPLC sensitivity is limited by the performance of the
              detectors used, and is typically in the range of 10-12 g/ml. Preliminary
              experimental results suggest the possibility of achieving detection limits of
              better than 10-15 g/ml.  The proposed research focuses on the development of
              derivatizing agents and techniques to introduce MPD-compatible labels to
              analytes which are present at subattomole/ml concentrations. If successful,
              this R&D effort will yield an ultra-high sensitivity detector and reagents for
              research and analysis using HPLC. The resulting HPLC/MPD system will enable
              researchers to isolate, detect and measure substances at levels which were
              previously unattainable.   Ultra-sensitive HPLC/MPD instrumentation will
              significantly facilitate the study of the role and function of biologically
              important substances such as neurotransmitters, steroidal hormones,
              angiotensins, and others. It will also greatly facilitate pharmaco-kinetic
              studies leading to a better understanding of drug interactions and the safety
              and effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. Thus HPLC/MPD instrumentation should
              find application in both academic and industrial laboratories.
