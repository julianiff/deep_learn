Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              develop a new, electronically tunable laser source, capable of emitting
              narrowband emission in the mid-infrared (IR) region - from 2 microns to
              approximately 4 microns.  Purely electronic tuning and high efficiency of
              difference frequency generation in a nonlinear crystal will be achieved by use
              of a specially designed acousto-optic tunable filter.  The filter serves two
              purposes: selecting two lasing wavelengths simultaneously generated inside the
              cavity and controlling the cavity gain for each of those wavelengths.  The gain
              control will ensure optimum pulse energies and pulse synchronization for
              efficient generation of mid-IR emission in a nonlinear KTiOPO4 (KTP) crystal.  
                  Development of this tunable laser for the mid-IR spectral region will
              enlarge the areas of application of laser spectroscopy and greatly increase the
              ability of differential absorption lidar techniques to detect atmospheric
              contaminants.  Such applications include, but are not limited to, remote
              atmospheric sensing and other environmental monitoring.
