Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              address the feasibility of a next-generation machine designed for flexible
              fabrication in vacuum processes and other micromachining applications.  It is a
              novel machine tool based on parallel platform robotics technology and is
              coupled with a standardized machine tool interface for existing integrated
              manufacturing applications.  The positioning system will have full six-axis
              motion, plus a redundant seventh axis permitting operation as either the tool
              or workpiece holder for numerous advanced manufacturing applications.  The
              technology is expected to benefit vacuum- and micropositioning-related
              industries by enabling affordable, precision components to be produced in small
              lots.  Phase I objectives include specification of the positioning system,
              development of a fully articulated laboratory model in a 3-D solid modeling
              environment, preliminary integration of manufacturing software into the virtual
              machine environment, performance assessment, laboratory model demonstration,
              and engineering model design.  A standardized, multi-faceted seven-axis
              positioning system, designed for vacuum use, will find numerous flexible
              manufacturing applications in electronic materials, metallurgy, optical
              coatings, thick-film coatings, instrumentation, tooling, forming, shaping,
              precision cutting, grinding, and drilling, as well as laser processing of
              advanced materials.
