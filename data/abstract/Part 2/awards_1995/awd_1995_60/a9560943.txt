Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
              determine the suitability of Stimpson's Surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma) for
              aquaculture development in northern New England from biological, technical and
              commercial perspectives.  Presently, there are too many unanswered questions
              about this surfclam's biology, environmental requirements and marketability to
              encourage aquaculture development.  The objectives of this project are to 1)
              determine the environmental requirements necessary to optimize growth and
              survival of M. polynyma in northern New England waters, 2) develop management
              techniques to efficiently grow this species to market size within 2-3 years, 3)
              determine the impact of toxic algal blooms on the culture and marketability of
              this species and 4) conduct a marketing survey and consumer preference study in
              order to predict market acceptance and demand for this new product in the
              United States and Japan.       The results of this research will provide
              aquaculturists with the information they need to decide whether or not to
              commercially cultivate this species.  Potentially, a new seafood product could
              be developed and marketed in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest.  Results from
              this project will also provide fishery managers and public health officials
              with much needed information about the impacts of toxic blooms on this
              commercial species.
