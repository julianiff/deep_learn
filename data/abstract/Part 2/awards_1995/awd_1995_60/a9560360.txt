Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop high
              temperature superconducting (HTS) films with a high power handling capability
              for high power RF and microwave components. RF and microwave passive components
              derived from HTS thin film technology offer several advantages in performance
              over the conventional metallic components. However, even though HTS thin film
              components exhibit very high-Q values, their power handling capability is often
              limited, imposing restrictions on the range of possible applications.
              Innovative approaches in HTS thin film process technology are required to
              obtain the film quality needed to overcome this problem.     The proposed
              approach combines improved thin film processing techniques with the design
              flexibility offered by a low dielectric constant substrate (MgF2) in achieving
              this goal. Ag-doped YBCO films on low dielectric constant MgF2 substrates
              (dielectric constant  5.4) with Sr2(Al,T)aO6 structural template, proposed in
              this feasibility effort are expected to result in at least an order of
              magnitude enhancement in the RF power handling capability of the films compared
              to those currently available.   HTS films with a high power handling capability
              would enable the design of high power HTS filters, multiplexers and filter
              banks. The major reduction in volume and weight together with improved
              performance of such devices in emerging high performance Transmit/ Receive
              systems is expected to outweigh the cost of cooling HTS circuitry to 77K.
