Abstract    :
              9560213  Bryant         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) in
              a form stable enough to withstand the melt spinning process.  If micro PCMs
              could be incorporated into melt-spun fibers, the resulting fabrics
              (polypropylene, nylon, polyester) would have greatly enlarged thermal storage
              capacities.  Micro PCMs have been successfully incorporated into low
              temperature, solution-spun acrylic fibers and fabric samples, increasing their
              thermal storage tenfold.  However, at melt spinning temperatures (higher than
              200oC) micro PCMs particles lose their core material, which corrupts the melt
              spinning process.  Before these materials can successfully be incorporated into
              melt spun fiber, capsules must be available with more stable wall structure. 
              Phase I will use differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermogravimetric
              analysis (TGA) to establish the behavior of current micro PCMs at temperatures
              exceeding 200oC and to understand the mechanism of microcapsule failure.  On
              this basis microcapsules will be produced with modified wall structures.  Their
              stability at high temperature will be compared to that of existing
              microcapsules.  The most promising concepts for thermal stability of micro-PCMs
              would be pursued in Phase II.       As micro-PCMs that are stable at high
              melt-spinning temperatures are made, thermally enhanced materials can be
              fabricated and marketed from melt spun fibers for apparel and industrial
              insulation materials, where hot or cold thermal control is needed.
