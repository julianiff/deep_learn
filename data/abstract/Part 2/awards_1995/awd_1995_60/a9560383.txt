Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores
              the feasibility of a new class of diamond composite field effect, electron
              emitters, that can be made at a low cost into cold cathodes with high emission
              uniformity, low threshold fields, and low power consumption.  Diamond has many
              unique properties that are superior to any other known materials.  One such
              property of n-type diamond is a potential for negative electron affinity,
              possibly enabling its use as a cold cathode electron emitter.  However, no
              verifiable n-type diamond has been produced and electron emission from diamond
              presently relies on the use of expensive p-type diamond, that must have
              specific crystal orientations and delicate surface treatments.       This
              project investigate commercially available undoped diamond powder and a variety
              of electronically conductive matrices to fabricate simple cold cathode
              materials that can be placed uniformly and in patterns over large area
              substrates.  Preliminary tests on some of these materials have shown that such
              diamond-based cathodes have good electron field effect properties.  These
              composites have potential utility in many vacuum-microelectronics applications
              that require a low power-consuming, high transconductance field effect device. 
              Potential applications for diamond composite emitter include flat panel
              displays, microwave amplifiers, power triodes, and other similar devices.
