Abstract    :
                 This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop a novel
              type of miniature mercury sensor utilizing very recent developments in
              microcantilevers. Sensors based on this technology will be up to 103 times
              smaller, considerably more sensitive, and less expensive than currently
              available mercury sensors.   Microcantilevers that are 50-200 (m long, 10-40 (m
              wide, and 0.3-3 (m thick and possessing resonance frequencies in the range
              10-300 kHz, have recently been used in scanning force microscopy to detect
              extremely small changes in force in the range of 10-12-10-9 N. The resonance
              frequency (and bending) of the microcantilever varies reproducibly and
              sensitively due to adsorption of molecules on the cantilever surfaces making it
              an ideal chemical sensor with picogram sensitivity and parts per billion
              detection. Preliminary mercury detection studies, have demonstrated detection
              of ppb of Hg, and have shown that selective adsorption of mercury on gold
              coated cantilevers (end loading) produces a linear variation in resonance
              frequency with a sensitivity of 0.8 pg/Hz. Simultaneous bending measurements
              resulted in a sensitivity of 0.6 pg/mV. The recyclability of the mercury sensor
              will be demonstrated by removing the adsorbed mercury by heating the sensor.
              Exploiting the microcantilever response, combined with selective removal of
              interfering molecules (such as H2S) using filters, microcantilevers will be
              shown to be extremely versatile and novel mercury pollution sensors. We plan to
              demonstrate that the sensor can be vibrated in liquid environments with a
              reasonable Q, allowing it to be used to detect the presence of mercury in these
              environments. Additionally, due to the extremely small size of the sensor, the
              development of a personal monitor that is highly sensitive may be possible. The
              proposed work will provide a highly significant advance in microcantilever
              sensor technology with possibilities of developing new sensors for other
              chemicals.   Commercial applications of mercury sensors include industrial
              hygiene, air and water pollution control, mining industry, submarines, air
              quality monitoring, etc.
