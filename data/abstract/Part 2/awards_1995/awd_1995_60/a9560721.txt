Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a
              design/feasibility study of accelerating focusing Rectangular Cavity Periodic
              Structures and Rectangular Cavity Biperiodic Structures (RCBS)to determine
              their applicability for commercial uses. Those applications range from Race
              Track Microtrons (RTM) to electron positron linear colliders as well as for
              microwave power devices.  A 70 MeV compact RTM will be used as a practical test
              bed to first reduce concepts ideas to practice.  A biperiodic on axis coupled
              rectangular accelerating structure with circular beam holes will be explored. 
              This provides a significant simplification in RTM construction. This RCBS also
              has a higher effective shunt impedance than previous structures and quadrupole
              like focusing so it is an accelerating focusing system which, if proved in
              simulation and hardware, can also be used to good effect in linacs and linear
              colliders.       Recent efforts in particle accelerator design have focused on
              improving existing accelerating structures, searching for more compact
              structures, and developing structures with better electrodynamic
              characteristics.  Commercial applications of rectangular cavity structures are
              apparent for (1) electron-positron linear colliders, (2) electron LINear
              ACcelerators, (3) mobile Race Track Microtrons, and (4) power microwave
              devices.
