Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              address new computer-aided-design (CAD) tools for manufacturing of microsensors
              and other microelectromechanical (MEM) devices.  These MEMCAD tools are an
              innovative enabling technology consisting of a CAD software tool set tailored
              for MEM systems.  In addition, they may also find use for microelectronic
              devices.       MEMCAD is an integrated software system consisting of databases,
              simulators, a solid modeler, and an intuitive graphic user-interface for the
              workstation environment.  It incorporates a wealth of empirical manufacturing
              data, which feed state-of-the-art simulation tools.  Using MEMCAD, process
              engineers and designers conceptualize, design, simulate, and optimize the
              performance of MEM devices from the same underlying knowledge base.  Phase I
              will develop the architecture of MEMCAD technology armed with anisotropic
              etching process technology and define the specific components needed to perform
              these functions.  A preliminary prototype of MEMCAD specific to bulk
              micromachining will be assembled and benchmarked.  Phase II would then
              assemble, test, and commercialize a complete MEMCAD system.       Anticipated
              benefits are lower prices for MEM system devices and faster introduction of
              these devices into use through lower development costs.  Commercial
              applications of these software tools are the design and development of MEM
              system devices such as sensors, actuators, and integrated circuits.
