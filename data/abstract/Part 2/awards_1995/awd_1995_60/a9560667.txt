Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate various
              fabrication techniques to develop a three layer `super thin film composite`
              membrane with both high selectivity and high flux. At present this firm has
              demonstrated an ability to fabricate thin films (less than .5 micron) of glassy
              fluoropolymer onto microporous supports. By placing a super thin layer (50A to
              200A) of high selectivity polymer on top of our non-porous glass fluoropolymer,
              the firm expects to fabricate membranes with both high selectivity and high
              flux. Techniques to establish this super thin layer (50A to 200A) include (a)
              chemical modification of surface, (b) coating of ultrathin layer on surface and
              (c) densification of top layer. To date, this concept has been very limited in
              that stable, high flux, high free volume non-porous membranes did not exist. In
              Phase I the firm will demonstrate the concept of super thin film composites. 
              New glassy, high free volume fluoropolymers are described which show very high
              permeability to permeant gases, low permeability to volatile organics, good
              selectivity and excellent stability. The glassy nature allows easy fabrication
              into high flux non-porous thin film membranes. These unique fluoropolymers
              allow fabrication of novel and valuable membrane structures.  Based on the
              excellent film forming capability, excellent gas flux and high selectivity of
              this glassy fluoropolymer, applications include production of oxygen enriched
              air for (I) industrial applications (i.e. glass/steel), (2) enhanced automotive
              power, fuel efficiency and reduced pollution, and (3) enhanced heating
              efficiency. The excellent chemical stability will be used in harsh chemical gas
              separations like H2/Cl2 in chlor-alkali processes or HF-fluorine separations.
