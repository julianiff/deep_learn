Abstract    :
                The proposed program will study the feasibility and develop the processing
              procedure for the construction of a high performance, high density,
              magneto-optical, reversible information storage media based on multilayer
              structures composed of a magnetic layer and a non-magnetic metallic layer. A
              number of multilayer structures have been proposed in the past. These include
              Pd/Co, Pt/Co, Pd/Fe, Tb/Fe, and Au/Co. These multilayer systems have shown
              performance superior to the traditionally used rare-earth -transition-metal
              alloys. All the multilayer structures proposed in the past use the conventional
              thin film deposition processes of evaporation or sputtering to deposit the thin
              films. As the required structures must consist of ultra-thin (one or two
              monolayers) with ultra-sharp, ultra-smooth interfaces and no interdiffusion
              between the layers can be tolerated, the vapor deposition processes, currently
              in use, can not achieve the surface roughness requirements of RMS values in the
              single Angstrom range. The proprietary deposition process, WIT-TIFID, developed
              by the proposer, can provide the all the above required thin film qualities
              essential for high performance devices. This program will develop the WIT-TIFID
              deposition process for magnetic metal multilayer structures (MMMS) to be used
              in magneto-optical (MO) recording media applications and show the advantages
              and superior perforrnance capabilities of the WIT-TIFID magnetic metal
              multilayer structures (MMMS) for applications in high performance, high
              density, reversible, information storage media technology.  Potential
