Abstract    :
              9560477  Kuo-Ching Liu         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will develop a submicron optical 3-D sensor, capable of
              performing in high-throughput, high-duty-cycle industrial applications such as
              semiconductor package inspection.  Laser confocal microscopy presently meets
              the increasing demands of 3-D imaging and is capable of submicron depth
              resolution.  Its deficiency is the mechanical serving of a minute field depth
              where the target might be found.  The technique is very slow, requires
              difficult microscope calibration, and can require frequent maintenance due to
              the wear of moving parts.  This Phase I explores an innovative illumination
              technique for rapid scanning of a broad depth of field electronically.  This
              sensor's resolution is an order of magnitude better than the best optical
              triangulation technique, the current state of the art in 3-D sensor technology.
               This technique requires no moving parts, is minimally impacted by obstruction,
              and is readily reconfigurable using interchangeable lenses to suit a wide range
              of depth-of-field and resolution requirements.  This technology is superior to
              both confocal microscopes and optical triangulation for rapid, high accuracy
              measurement.       This sensor technology will find wide application in
              semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing, precision electromechanical
              assembly, precision metrology (CMM's), optoelectronics, and
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The semiconductor industry in
              particular will need for a submicron sensor with sufficient speed to conduct
              in-line inspection of semiconductor packages at various stages of manufacture.
