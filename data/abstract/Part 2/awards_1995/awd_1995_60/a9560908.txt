Abstract    :
              9560908  Pinnau    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              focuses on the development of high-performance membranes for the separation of
              carbon dioxide/hydrogen mixtures. This separation is performed on a massive
              scale in every refinery as part of the production process for hydrogen. Current
              best technologies are amine absorption or pressure swing adsorption, both
              expensive, energy-intensive processes.  The membranes to be developed are based
              on rubbery, highly hydrophilic polyether-polyamide block copolymers.
              Preliminary data show that the membranes are exceptionally selective for the
              separation of polar/nonpolar gas mixtures such as carbon dioxide/hydrogen. The
              Phase I project will be the first quantitative evaluation of the gas transport
              properties of polyether-polyamide block copolymers for this industrially
              important application. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the new
              polymers will be made into thin-film composite membranes on a laboratory scale.
              Phase II, if successful, will develop techniques to make thin-film composite
              membranes and modules on a commercial scale, and evaluate the modules in pilot
              scale systems.        High-performance, hydrophilic rubbery polymers that
              exhibit higher selectivity and higher gas permeability than conventional
              hydrophobic polymers could have a significant impact on many polar/nonpolar gas
              separation applications, such as the removal of carbon dioxide from hydrogen.
              Availability of these novel polymers in thin-film composite membranes and
              modules would dramatically improve the process economics and make membrane
              systems competitive with conventional separation methods in these applications.
