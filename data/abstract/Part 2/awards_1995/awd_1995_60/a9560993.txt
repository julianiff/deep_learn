Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
              evaluate independent strategies for extending operating lifetimes of SQUlDs
              fabricated from YBa2Cu307-( step-edge junctions. Two strategies will be
              evaluated in Phase 1. The first strategy is to find a coating that is suitable
              for protecting Josephson junctions and is compatible with `flip chip`
              technology. The second approach is to fabricate step-edge junctions from the
              corrosion resistant phase of Yl-xCaxBa2-yLayCu3O7-( and Gdl-xCaxBa2LayCu3O7-(
              compounds. Corrosion is particularly problematic during the fabrication and
              operation of step-edge Josephson junctions and the strategies developed in this
              work will be applicable to a large range of devices fabricated from cuprate
              superconductors.  One of the most serious problems that has limited the
              commercialization of YBa2Cu307-( devices are their lack of environmental
              stability. The cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu307-(  tends to degrade rapidly
              when exposed to the ambient atmosphere through corrosion reactions caused by
              H20 and CO2. These corrosion problems severely limit the lifetimes of
              electronic devices fabricated from YBa2Cu307-(.  The current generation of
              cuprate based devices are very susceptible to corrosion and have a very limited
              lifetime. The proposed research is intended to lead to new technologies for the
              fabrication of robust superconducting electronics. These devices may find
              application in a number of diverse areas such as MRI, NMR, magnetic sensing,
              and low noise electronics.
