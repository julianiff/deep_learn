Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              a liquid crystal based, magneto-optic sensor for direct visualization of
              discontinuities.  This approach uses eddy currents but has advantages over
              conventional eddy current methods.  The sensor has potential for significantly
              increasing the field-of-view of eddy current instruments (5x) without a
              dramatic increase in cost.  Moreover, there is good potential for making the
              sensor flexible enough to test curved and contoured parts.  Phase I will focus
              on the design and fabrication of magneto-optic sensors using new,
              high-sensitivity liquid crystal systems to demonstrate the feasibility of the
              proposed eddy current testing approach.       This sensor will have commercial
              applications in the $500 million nondestructive testing market, where eddy
              current testing is currently oneof the fastest growing segments.  There may
              also be applications in other fields such as biomagnetics and military
              surveillance.
