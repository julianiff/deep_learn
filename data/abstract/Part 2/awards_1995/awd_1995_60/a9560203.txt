Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              examine a novel approach to semiconductor diode laser operation in the
              increasingly important 2-5 micron band and beyond.  Using indium thallium
              phosphide (InTlP), in conjunction with well-developed indium gallium arsenide
              phosphide (InGaAsP) epitaxial materials on InP substrates, high performance
              laser structures may be made to operate at room temperature or near-room
              temperature at mid-infrared (IR) wavelengths.  In Phase I InTlP will be grown
              by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  Electrical and optical
              properties of the materials will be characterized, and simple light-emitting
              diodes (LEDs) with an InTlP active region will be fabricated to determine
              suitability for IR lasers.  Preliminary laser structures will be designed. 
              Phase II would fabricate, characterize, and optimize laser structures for many
              useful applications.  Phase I is expected to provide information for robust,
              high-performance, III-V mid-infrared semiconductor lasers by MOCVD       Highly
              reliable, low cost diode lasers, capable of room temperature operation in the
              important 2-5 micron wavelength range would impact many technological areas. 
              In particular, this development would make possible compact, robust,
              state-of-the-art diode lasers for environmental pollution monitoring, wind
              shear sensing, manufacturing process control, communications, military
              countermeasures, and IR molecular spectroscopy.
