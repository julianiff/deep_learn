Abstract    :
              95604752  Field         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a low cost technique to provide highly reproducible
              wavelength stabilization of diode lasers.  Frequency stabilized diode lasers
              are required for applications including wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM)
              communications networks, process control, medical instrumentation, and data
              storage.  At present these needs can only be met using expensive distributed
              feedback and distributed Bragg reflection diode lasers.  This Phase I will
              provide an integrated optic reflection grating structure which can be used to
              stabilize and lock the output wavelength of inexpensive Fabry-Perot diode
              lasers, significantly reducing the cost of single frequency stabilized sources.
               The same grating fabrication process can be applied to stabilize the entire
              range of diode laser output wavelengths.  The project will build and measure
              the performance of an integrated grating feedback device which may then be
              integrated into a prototype laser device in Phase II.       The product is
              expected to be a frequency stabilized diode laser which operates at a pre-set
              optical frequency and which will be commercially applied in WDM communications
              networks, process control, medical instrumentation, and data storage.  This
              technology has a sufficiently low cost that it may also stimulate applications
              beyond these markets.
