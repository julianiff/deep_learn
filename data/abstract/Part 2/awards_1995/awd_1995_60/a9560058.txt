Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a new
              and innovative approach for formation evaluation at the drill bit. Radioactive
              Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tools are currently in use for measuring
              formation density and neutron porosity. However, these have limited
              capabilities and involve safety and environmental risks. A project is proposed
              with the objective of developing an electrical Neutron/X-ray (N/X) tool which
              will replace both of the existing radioactive tools. This novel instrument is
              expected to offer: (1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower costs and
              (3) greatly reduced safety and environmental hazards. The objective of Phase I
              is to demonstrate proof-of-principle for the N/X MWD tool concept by: (1)
              designing and assembling an N/X source experiment; (2) operating the experiment
              to demonstrate high neutron output; (3) developing the conceptual design for an
              N/X tool integrated into a 17 cm (6.75 inch) drill collar and (4) performing
              computer modeling studies to assess and maximize tool performance.        A
              leading MWD company will participate in the Phase I project, thereby initiating
              the commercialization process. Success in Phase I will form a firm foundation
              for demonstration of a laboratory prototype N/X logging system in Phase II. 
              This project will provide an advanced non-radioactive MWD logging tool with
              numerous advantages relative to existing tools. It will provide for measurement
              of: (1) density and lithology; (2) thermal neutron capture cross section; (3)
              neutron porosity through temporal and spatial measurements of the epithermal
              neutron population; and (4) neutron induced spectral gamma-rays. This will be
              valuable for safe and economical development of oil and gas wells, and for
              research.
