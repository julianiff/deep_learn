Abstract    :
              9560893  Yadav         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              focuses on producing novel refractory microspheres for insulation applications.
              Insulation is an essential technology with a broad impact on almost all
              industries. Fuel effficiency, raw material usage, equipment size, equipment
              weight, and system reliability all depend on the properties of the insulation
              used in the system. Existing insulation materials have one or more of the
              following limitations: (1) excessive volume or weight; (2) material degradation
              at temperatures greater than 1000 degrees C; (3) low thermal shock resistance;
              and (4) high cost. This project will focus on producing refractory microspheres
              that feature low weight, low volume, high thermal shock resistance, low cost
              and the ability to work effectively at temperatures as high as 2,500 degrees C.
              During Phase I, the concept will be demonstrated. If approved, Phase II will
              optimize and field test the novel insulation system.         Thermal insulation
              is a major industry serving a wide range of residential and industrial
              application needs. Low and high temperature insulation is needed to maximize
              fuel efficiency in process industries, reduce heating and utility bills in
              residential markets, protect microelectronics and fragile devices from the
              adverse effects of heat, and ensure safety of personnel and property on
              fire-prone structures such as bridges and offshore oil rigs.
