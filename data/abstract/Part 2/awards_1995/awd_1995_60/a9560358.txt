Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the primary
              objective of developing nonlinear optical (NLO) thin films on GaAs substrates.
              NLO films on GaAs offer a number of potential applications in integrated
              optics. With the thin film approach it is possible to develop an integrated
              optics technology in which light sources, nonlinear optical components and
              detectors may be developed on the same substrate. At present, the growth of
              device quality films on GaAs remains a major technological challenge. Until
              now, the performance of the NLO films on GaAs has not exceeded or equaled the
              performance of the bulk counterparts. Therefore an immediate need exists for an
              improved growth process for promoting superior quality films compared to those
              presently available. Also, for integration with GaAs, lower growth temperatures
              are required. The primary objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to
              explore the potential of ion beam assisted pulsed laser deposition (IBPLD) as a
              new low temperature technique for the growth of high quality nonlinear optical
              films on GaAs substrates. The approach will require synthesis of NLO films by
              IBPLD technique and identification of critical process parameters that are
              compatible with GaAs processing leading to optimum nonlinear optical
              properties. As a prototype, KTa 0.52 Nb0.48 O3 films with a Tc of 88 C will be
              epitaxially deposited on GaAs substrates with MgO buffer layers and their
              nonlinear optical performance will be evaluated.   The nonlinear optical films
              on GaAs offer unique device possibilities in optical signal processing, optical
              computing and beam steering. The film process technology is generic and could
              lead to a new generation of integrated optical devices. For Neocera, the
              nonlinear optical thin film technologies and commercial IBPLD systems, as
              commodity products, could further expand the existing market base.
