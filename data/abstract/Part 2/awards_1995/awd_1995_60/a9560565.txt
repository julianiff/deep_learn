Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              develop a new capability for robust system identification that will enable more
              effective neurocontrol.  This research will specifically address control of
              complex nonlinear dynamic systems.  It will develop figures-of-merit for system
              identification, useful to translate quality-evaluation metrics into terms that
              can be readily used for computation of a strategic utility function in an
              adaptive-critic neurocontrol architecture.  It will explore biologically-based
              approaches to system identification that will permit modeling of more complex
              systems, including systems which evolve or change over time.  It will also
              enhance cabilities to build system identification with complex temporal
              associations, allowing more complex processes to be controlled.  One or more of
              these innovations will be hosted in an adaptive critic architecture. 
              Feasibility demonstrations will select and use an appropriate function for
              optimization and use of context-dependent processes in producing a system
              model.       The improved system identification methods developed in this
              project will, when inserted into a robust neurocontrol system such as an
              adaptive critic, permit adaptive control of a wide range of systems with
              applications to flight control, control of electric cars, control of biomedical
              devices, robotic motion control, and many others.  This capability will be
              applied to a currently developing commercial flight control technology in
              hypersonic waverider as well as potentially to the next-generation `clean car.`
