Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will greatly
              simplify and enhance the sensitivity of food inspection equipment.  Toxins and
              pathogens, such as aflatoxin, T-2 toxin, zearalenone, E. coli 0157:H7, and
              salmonella, have been responsible for outbreaks of foodborne illness, some
              cases of which have been fatal.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) will develop
              novel photonic techniques for detecting such organisms, and reducing the time
              required for food testing.  The novelty of the proposed method lies in its use
              of disposable dipstick tapered fiber optic sensors (optrodes), long lifetime
              chelates, and a highly sensitive optical system to detect a small number of
              toxins and organisms in juices/milk and preenrichment cultures. The multiple
              tapered fiber probes with in-situ multi-analyte `rapid` monitoring capability
              are designed for optimal optical delivery and collection efficiency, and for
              maximal detection sensitivity.  Evanescent wave sensing and long lifetime
              chelate eliminate the fluorescence from the bulk sample, which is often the
              limiting factor of sensitivity. Food inspection will directly benefit from the
              unique characteristics of this approach (modified in-situ inspection, no
              biofouling, small sample size, minimal background, and high sensitivity), which
              give it specific advantages over existing chemical and biochemical sensing
              technologies.  The Phase I project will focus on the feasibility demonstration
              of the proposed technology based on the detection of aflatoxin B I in solution.
                    The proposed technique can be adapted to detect various biological
              materials in foods, including spoilage, pathogens, parasites, hormones, toxins,
              pesticides, and vitamins.  The world food quality detection market is estimated
              to be $275M for 1995 and $475M by the year 2000, of which $15M and $100M,
              respectively, are expected to be directly addressed by on-line biosensors.  The
              commercial potential of this device in health and environmental safety
              applications is immense.  This technology also has potential for the detection
              of infectious agents such as HIV, staph, and ebola virus.
