Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate the fabrication of volume holographic grating filters for
              retro-reflection in the 1.55 micron band with sufficient bandwidth to provide
              wavelength monitoring over a 1 to 2 nm range.  This would be sufficient to
              monitor any signal over the full channel width of a wavelength division
              multiplexed (WDM) optical network, addressing a need for external wavelength
              references to insure that the lasers do not drift out of their assigned
              channels.  Current alternatives are not feasible for integration into telecom
              equipment because of size constraints or technical limitations.  Phase I will
              focus on increasing bandwidth on current holographic grating filters and
              decreasing input signal requirements with higher detector sensitivity.  A
              prototype design will be made.       Anticipated commercial applications of
              this technology include network monitors for WDM transmitters and accurate
              wavelength laser sources, both for telecom and other laboratory applications. 
              In addition, filters can be used for remote sensing, i.e., eye-safe LIDAR,
              instrumentation, and spectroscopy.
