Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
              investigate  plasma polymerization as an alternative to spin coating of organic
              anti-  reflective coatings (ARCs). In this method, the ARC will be formed 
              directly on the substrate to alleviate the problems associated with spin 
              coating. Phase I will focus on achieving defect-free, highly conformal 
              coatings on semiconductor substrates using existing plasma-depositable  polymer
              materials and processes.  IC manufacturers have consistently pursued the use of
              larger wafer sizes and smaller device features to improve product yield, reduce
              unit cost, and increase on-chip computing power. Reducing substrate
              reflectivity to less than 1% during photoresist exposure will be critical for
              maintaining dimensional control at these feature sizes. Spin coated ARCs offer
              excellent reflectivity control but are limited by uniformity, defectivity, and
              conformality problems stemming form the spin coating process.  The long term
              goal of this work is to introduce a turn-key ARC product package containing:
              (1) a dedicated deposition tool, (2) a set of plasma-depositable polymer
              materials designed specifically for ARC applications, and, (3) processes for
              depositing organic ARCs on a variety of key device structures.  The
              availability of high performance organic ARCs is critical for the successful
              implementation of deep UV(248 and 193 nm) microlithographic processes by U.S.
              and foreign chip makers over the next 10 years. The international market for
              deep UV ARC materials is estimated to grow to $25 MM by 2005. The proposed
              effort will build a technology platform for assuring the availability of
              organic ARC processes after the usefulness of spin coated ARCs has been
              surpassed.
