Abstract    :
              9560625  Mariwala         This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I
              project will develop a molecular sieve catalyst for selective hydrogenation of
              benzene to cyclohexene. Currently, no commercial catalyst is available for
              shape selective cyclohexene synthesis. The molecular sieve catalyst will
              combine the two unit operations of reaction and separation into a single
              reactive separation step. The selective synthesis will be accomplished by shape
              and size selective discrimination of molecules involved in the reaction.  In
              Phase I, molecular sieve catalysts will be prepared for selective synthesis of
              cyclohexene. The catalyst will be characterized for structure, morphology, and
              metal content. The catalysts will be tested for shape selective hydrogenation
              activity.       Cyclohexene is expected to be a major feed stock for bulk
              chemical production and an important chemical intermediate for specialty
              chemical industry. Use of cyclohexene as a feed stock offers significant
              environmental, operational and economic advantages.
