Abstract    :
              ***  9560467  Wilde          This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will examine enhanced holographic data storage in ferroelectric
              photorefractive recording media.  This is thought to be a promising solution to
              an input/output bottleneck between high-speed microprocessors and mass storage
              peripherals.  Although many necessary optical systems components are now
              available, a suitable volume recording medium is still lacking.  This research
              will explore the use of domain screening in a ferroelectric medium to improve
              dynamic range and and other features.  When combined with two-photon recording
              for nonvolatile readout, this approach to a storage material is expected to
              provide very high performance.         If the approach is feasible, it could
              lead to significant advances in database management, high-definition digital
              video, and new interactive multimedia software for the entertainment industry,
              education, and business.  ***
