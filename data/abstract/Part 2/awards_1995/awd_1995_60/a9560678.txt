Abstract    :
              9560678  Kwan    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              addresses a novel concept in amphibious vehicles.  The vehicle would drive on
              normal roads at customary speeds and yet provide off-road traction equal to
              that of tracked vehicles.  It would utilize a series of co-axial half wheels in
              tandem, adjusted and synchronized to maintain road contact at constant height
              above ground and thus maintain smooth vehicular movement at speed.  When
              operating in water, the half wheels provide efficient propulsion, with no wheel
              adjustment required in landing on a beach.  Phase I will conduct feasibility
              tests with a powered model.    Commercial applications are potentially in use
              as amphibious vehicles for recreational and rescue purposes.  It may also find
              use at farm and construction sites while affording convenient travel on
              conventional raods at normal speeds.
