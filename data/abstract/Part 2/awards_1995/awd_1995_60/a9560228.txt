Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              demonstrate the applicability of a novel approach to produce low cost, high
              conductivity, and ultralight bipolar plates for fuel cell applications.  An
              innovative approach to produce conductive polymers will provide conductivities
              comparable to currently used graphite bipolar plates.  The fabrication
              technology of such a conductive polymer will be investigated to produce net
              shape bipolar plates, thus eliminating the exceedingly expensive machining of
              graphite plates.  The conductive polymer bipolar plates will be fully
              characterized and evaluated in single cell configurations for electrochemical
              stability, resistivity, and gas diffusion.  The overall concept will be
              assessed for both technical performance and cost for possible further
              development in Phase II.        Conductive polymers could offer a significant
              performance and cost advantage to fuel cell technologies, such as may be
              required in the electric-car Next Generation Vehicle.  Net shape conductive
              polymer bipolar plates could be produced for this and many other commercial
              fuel cell applications.
