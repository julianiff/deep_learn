Abstract    :
              9560224  Boulton    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project explores a new approach to ultra precision honing.  Honing processes
              used for flat machining play a vital role in U. S. manufacturing.  With the
              exception of urethane stones made in-house by some domestic end users, the bulk
              of these grindstones are currently made from PVA (poly vinyl alcohol resin),
              produced in Japan, and imported in the U.S.    Likely products are high
              performance stones engineered for flat surface machining applications that fit
              a low cost-of-ownership manufacturing model.  Phase I proposal will investigate
              new compositions and approaches for fabricating honing stones made with U.S.
              products.  Optimization will be studied by testing against Japanese stones for
              existing product lines and against lapping processes where honing stones are
              not yet available.
