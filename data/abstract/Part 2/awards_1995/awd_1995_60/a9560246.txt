Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
              feasibility of parallel logic simulation for large deep submicron VLSI designs
              using advanced UNIX workstations.  The number of transistors implemented on an
              integrated circuit doubles every 2 to 3 years. This fact affects all the
              aspects of the design methodology, including design simulation that takes
              several days to weeks of computing to verify the correctness of a VLSI design.
              Moreover, designs that contain multi-million gates can not be simulated as a
              single system since they are either too big to fit on today's workstations, or
              generate too many page faults making the simulation too slow.  This project
              will investigate a scalable architecture for performing distributed and
              parallel digital logic simulation on UNIX workstations. The distributed feature
              deals with the size and eliminates the page-fault problem. The scalable and
              parallel feature makes it possible to simulate multi-million gate designs.  The
              Phase I effort will establish architecture requirements, develop the
              architecture, derive necessary algorithms at the system level, develop a scaled
              version and analyze the potential performance that can be obtained.
              State-of-the-art logic simulation and parallel processing technology will be
              used for this effort. Verification will be made that the architecture is
              compliant with the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry standard so that
              commercialization is possible.       The proposed architecture has the
              potential to develop and commercialize three products:  (1) Scalable
              Distributed Parallel Verilog( Simulator; (2) Scalable Distributed Parallel VHDL
              Simulator; and, (3) Scalable Distributed Parallel Co-Simulator.
