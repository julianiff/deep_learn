Abstract    :
              9560738  Weiss    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              addresses a need that arises out of the recent advances in probability modeling
              algorithms and software and the increasing capabilities and decreasing costs of
              computer hardware:  It is now computationally feasible to construct and apply
              large probability models, but the elicitation of probabilities to populate
              those models is still labor-intensive and inefficient.  The solution to this
              problem lies in an automated probability elicitation tool that can help the
              modeler to structure probability models (Bayes nets) in ways that require fewer
              and simpler probability assessments; that can support a variety of elicitation
              modes (numerical, graphical, verbal, etc.) for both discrete and continuous
              random variables; that can help avoid or remedy the biases, inconsistencies,
              and miscalibrations that may characterize various elicitation modes; and that
              can use test cases or scenarios as a global-level check on the consistency and
              accuracy of the locally assessed probabilities in the model.  This Phase I
              effort will help establish the technical validity of the basic concepts
              underlying such an automated probability elicitation tool.  Its research
              objectives are to develop (1) a measure of the magnitude of an assessment task
              which can be applied to estimate elicitation requirements and to restructure
              the probability model for greater efficiency; (2) a characterization of random
              variable domains and the most appropriate elicitation modes for each; (3) a
              list of potential biases and errors associated with each elicitation mode; and
              (4) an approach that uses test cases or scenarios to highlight and measure
              discrepancies between domain experts' global case-based judgments and the
              model-based computed values.  A variety of analytic techniques will be used,
              including mathematical and statistical analyses, value-of-information analysis,
              fuzzy sets to improve the discretization of continuous distributions, and
              Gaussian parametric approximati ons to continuous distributions.  In addition,
              empirical psychological research to characterize assessment biases and errors
              will be initiated.   The potential applications of an automated probability
              elicitation tool extend throughout government and industry, virtually anywhere
              probability models are used; current and near-term prospects include military
              intelligence analysis, medical diagnosis, fault diagnosis for industrial or
              transportation systems, and financial applications.  Once fully developed, the
              elicitation tool may be marketed as a stand-alone software product, licensed as
              proprietary code to developers of probability modeling software, or used as a
              building block for domain-specific applications to be marketed directly to
              companies using probability models.
