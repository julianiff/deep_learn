Abstract    :
              ***  9560496  Zhao         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop compact, low cost, ultra-narrow bandwidth (approx. O.1 A)
              holographic filters for solar imaging at the CaII line (3933 A).  This
              addresses a key requirement for narrow band width filters in this wavelength
              region because of the difficulty in fabricating Lyot and similar interference
              filters with sufficient spectral resolution and optical quality in the blue to
              W region.  In this program, the feasibility of recording high efficiency and
              low f-number (f/15 or lower) holographic imaging filters using photorefractive
              LiNbO3 crystals will be demonstrated.  Recording holograms at other blue to W
              wavelengths in processed LiNbO3 crystals will also be investigated.  This
              research program is expected to produce data on the optimum material
              characteristics and limits of recording high efficiency gratings at short
              wavelengths.       Anticipated commercial applications of this technology
              include filters for solar astronomy, emission spectroscopy and pollution
              monitoring using optical remote sensing, and solar blind filters for free-space
              optical communication.  Potential applications include: W narrow bandwidth
              filters for optical remote sensing; pollutant, chemical, metal, and mineral
              detection; solar-blind filters for free-space optical communications; high
              density optical disks and holographic data storage.   ***
