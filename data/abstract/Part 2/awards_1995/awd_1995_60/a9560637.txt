Abstract    :
              9560637  Langlois         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Project describes remote sensing of the physical properties of earth's surface
              and subsurface with radar systems.  It is of generic interest to the
              geophysical science community and is important to a wide range of military and
              commercial applications.  Recently, an experimental radar was used by
              researchers from the University of Kansas to map the thickness of the
              Jacobshavn glacier in Greenland.  This radar produced high range resolution
              measurements of ice thickness but suffered from very coarse cross-track
              resolution.  This proposal describes a novel nadir-looking imaging radar system
              that can provide three-dimension volume images of the structure and depth of
              glaciers and icebergs to depths of several km.  by utilizing a conformal array
              of many antenna elements mounted on the underside of an aircraft wing, we can
              employ digital beamforming techniques to generate up to 40 beams in the
              cross-track direction, each with a narrow 1.4 to 3 degree beamwidth.  Along
              track resolution will be achieved by unfocused SAR processing.  The resultant
              volume images generated by this radar will have spatial resolution on the order
              of 30m x 30m x 30m at ranges of 1 to 2 km, sampled from the top surface down to
              ground level several km below the surface.       Potential commercial
              applications include surveying ice in polar regions, as well as subsurface
              imaging of metallic objects, hazardous waste, tunnels, and detection of hard
              targets through foliage.
