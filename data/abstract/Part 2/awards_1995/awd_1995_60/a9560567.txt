Abstract    :
              ***  9560567  Hansen         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project investigates the Operator Training Simulator (OTS) of the
              Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to be applied to electric power
              distribution systems. System automation in electric power systems is moving
              rapidly beyond transmission systems. Control in the distribution area raises a
              new need to train distribution control center operators in complex situations.
              Phase I will incorporate three-phase models and a three-phase load flow into
              the EPRI-OTS package, modify a graphical user interface so that three-phase
              results can be visualized by the operator, and find testing locations for later
              SBIR Phase II research. Phase I is expected to produce innovative, new OTS
              software for distribution management systems (DMS).       Electric power
              utilities need training for their DMS operators. Softwares products will be
              aimed at meeting this need and to assist software developers in new tools for
              electric power distribution systems.  ***
