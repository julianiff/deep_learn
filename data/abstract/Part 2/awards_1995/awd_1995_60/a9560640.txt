Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              investigates the design of a steam modulated water jet that can be used for
              surface cleaning or material machining operations.  The collapse of a steam
              bubble in subcooled water is known to result in pressure waves of very large
              magnitude.  These pressure waves can be used to fracture and/or remove material
              from a surface if directed.       A water nozzle which periodically injects
              steam bubbles into subcooled water will be studied.  The pressure from the
              collapsing steam bubbles is directed through an acoustically designed nozzle to
              the work surface.  It is anticipated that the device, when perfected, could be
              used to remove any affixed material safely and efficiently without degrading
              the properties of the substrate surface (wood, steel, concrete, or composite)
              or otherwise fatiguing or damaging the surface.  All of the removed material is
              carried away in a filtered water stream and produces minimum waste and no dust.
                    The successful development of a steam modulated water jet cleaner would
              result in a new cleaning tool which has no moving parts and the potential for
              achieving material removal rates heretofore not attainable, with minimum waste,
              no dust, substantially lower cost, enhanced operator safety, and surface
              integrity maintained.
