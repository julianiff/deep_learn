Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
              unique diamond based cold cathode electron source that contains a randomly
              distributed high density of emission sites, fast response time, low energy
              spread, and high thermal conductivity. Due to the novel structure proposed and
              use of diamond as the cathode material, this electron source should not be
              subject to built-in wear-out mechanisms of Spindt-type field emission cathodes
              and should be relatively impervious to substrate poisoning by residual
              contamination. In Phase I this firm will construct this novel diamond-based
              electron source and test the properties of this source by comparing performance
              with more traditional Spindt-type field emission cathodes.   The anticipated
              benefits of the proposed material include reduced production costs and
              increased performance of field emission electron sources used in vacuum
              electronic devices, electron sources for electron microscopes, and electron
              sources for field emission flat panel display devices.
