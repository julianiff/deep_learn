Abstract    :
              9560480  Downing         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate several potential system architectures that could be
              employed in a solid-state, three-dimensional volumetric display based on
              two-photon upconversion (more specifically, two-step, two-frequency
              upconversion).  Alternative system designs will be examined in terms of cost,
              complexity, and system performance.  Applications that are well suited to
              particular designs will be identified, and a preferred design showing strong
              market potential will be selected for later Phase II development.      
              Commercial uses of a solid-state 3D display include medical imaging, computer
              aided design (CAD) and manufacturing CAM), engineering work stations,
              scientific visualization, air traffic control, geological and oceanic
              exploration, molecular modeling, environmental hazards evaluation,
              architectural design, education, entertainment, and defense.
