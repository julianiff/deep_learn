Abstract    :
              9560256  Taylor   The purpose of this SBIR Phase I grant is to construct and
              test a full size fluid damper using electrorheological (ER) fluid as its
              operating medium.  The damper can be installed within the frame of a building
              or bridge to increase the structure's capability to resist earthquake loads. 
              The damper uses a unique monolithic control valve having no moving parts and
              using internal flows of the ER fluid.  The valve is electronically activated by
              a control signal to alter the damping constant of the damper.  When activated,
              ER fluids radically increase in viscosity, approaching a gel-like state.  This
              change of state can occur instantaneously and disturbs flow through the control
              valve, thus greatly increasing the damper's resistance.  This also allows the
              damper to respond to the extremely broad range of frequencies existing in a
              structure during a seismic event   This research will allow the active control
              of building and bridges subjected to earthquakes motions, reducing or
              eliminating damage during maximum credible seismic motions.  The damping forces
              dissipate the seismic energy, thus greatly reducing damage to the structure. 
              Because the required power to operate an ER damper us very low, even
              conventional batteries become effective sources of control power for massive
              structures.  Specific structures which will show the greatest improvements are
              steel frame buildings and reinforced concrete highway bridges.
