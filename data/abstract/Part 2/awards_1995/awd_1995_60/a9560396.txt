Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use pressureless
              reaction sintering to generate transparent aluminum oxynitride samples with a
              minimum of 80 percent in-line light transmission and a maximum of 10 percent
              haze. A thorough microstructural evaluation of AlON samples synthesized in an
              earlier program will be carried out by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron
              microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss
              spectroscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. The effect of MgO addition on
              microstructures and nanostructures, the lattice structure, and the lattice
              parameters will be clarified. The nature of grain boundaries, i.e., the
              presence of a second phase, will be investigated. The solid solubility limits
              for MgO in AlON will be determined. The information gained will be used to slow
              down the fast grain-boundary movement, which causes excessive grain growth and
              pore entrapment within the grains, thereby preventing full densification and
              causing loss of transparency. A stepwise reaction sintering will be used to
              improve the densification-rate-to-reaction-rate ratio.   Because pressureless
              sintering is used to manufacture AlON, processing large panels with curvatures
              will be practical. Sintered AlON is expected to cost 50 percent less than
              hot-pressed MgAl2O4 of comparable size because of the ease of manufacturing
              AlON by pressureless sintering. Potential applications include high-temperature
              windows (AlON is also infrared transparent),high-pressure lamp envelopes,
              transparent armor, watch glass (AlON's high hardness makes it scratch
              resistant), furnace windows, and radiation windows in next-generation fusion
              reactors.
