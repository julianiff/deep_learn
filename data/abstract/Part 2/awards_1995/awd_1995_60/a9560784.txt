Abstract    :
              9560784    Valenzuela    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project addresses reduced use and emissions of volatile organic compounds
              (VOCs) during semiconductor manufacture.  VOCs are solvents of active
              photoresist material, and their emission is regulated by the Clean Air Act and
              by local permitting agencies.  This project is also part of NSF's 1995
              initiative for Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing.    Presently,
              photoresist is dispensed at the center of a spinning wafer.  A very large
              excess is needed to achieve uniform thickness because of the application only
              at the wafer center.  This research will apply a uniform layer over the entire
              wafer using ink jet printing technology.  With a distributed deposition, less
              photoresist is required for final uniformity during spinning.  Thickness
              uniformity will be tested by SEMATECH, which will develop plans for subsequent
              prototype hardware tests in an integrated circuit manufacturing environment.
