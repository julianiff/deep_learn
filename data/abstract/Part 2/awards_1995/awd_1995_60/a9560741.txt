Abstract    :
              9560741    Wang     The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR grant is to
              develop a fast early warning system for impending earthquake motion, called the
              Integrated Telecommunications Information System for Disaster Reduction
              (ITIS-DR).  The system integrates advanced satellite telecommunication
              technology, intelligent sensor devices, and accumulated disaster modeling
              knowledge.  ITIS-DR consists of four major subsystems:  (1) a monitor subsystem
              that collects and transmits potential disaster data to a (2) central control
              subsystem that processes the data and sends final warning via a (3)
              telecommunications subsystems to a (4) reception subsystem that displays the
              data and directly controls system shutdown for users.   The ITIS-DR will
              provide an early warning that will reduce casualties from earthquakes.  The
              systems also has the potential to be extended to include global warning from
              allied weather, flood and other disaster information.
