Abstract    :
              ***  9560501  Dhundale         Messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis is a critically
              important technique in molecular biology.  The goal of this project is the
              development of an ultra-sensitive method enabling direct measurement of
              endogenous mRNA in cell lines or primary cells present in a 96 well microplate.
               The procedure will negate the need for mRNA purification, thermocycling, or
              other forms of target amplification such as required with Q-PCR.  A defined
              biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide probe will specifically hybridize to the
              target mRNA in fixed cells.  Background or nonspecifically bound signal will be
              minimized by 1) requiring two specific hybridization events and 2) washing and
              subsequent release of the specifically bound probe which is then transferred
              and recaptured in a streptavidin coated plate.  A sandwich-type assay will be
              employed with an ultra-sensitive, novel, enzymatic amplification system to
              increase the signal and yield a luminescent end-point.  The method should be
              sensitive enough to measure an mRNA with ten copies per cell, 10,000 cells per
              well, i.e.- subattomole mRNA levels or 100,000 mRNA molecules per well.  The
              method has generic utility since each new target mRNA simply requires synthesis
              of an appropriate oligonucleotide and use of standardized fixation,
              hybridization, and signal amplification procedures.        Oncogene Science
              Inc. will offer reagent systems through the Research Products Division to
              provide a powerful             tool for the molecular and cellular bioscience
              research community.  ***
