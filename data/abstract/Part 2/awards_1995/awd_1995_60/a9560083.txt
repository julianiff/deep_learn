Abstract    :
              9560083  Sokolov    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a newly discovered characteristic of resonant tunneling
              diodes.  The University of Minnesota has been found a novel and strong stress
              dependence in the current-voltage characteristics of III-V semiconductor double
              barrier resonant tunneling devices.  The effects are attributed to
              piezoelectric properties of the materials, and the stress dependence is
              magnified by a strongly nonlinear dependence of the resonant tunneling current
              on the applied bias.  Preliminary estimates of the gauge factor, which is a
              strain gauge figure of merit, approach 1000, which is roughly five times the
              sensitivity of silicon-based piezoelectric sensors in common industrial use. 
              Phase I will assess a novel resonant tunneling strain sensor relative to
              current strain sensor technology.  With consulting support from the University
              of Minnesota, the company will model the current-voltage characteristics, model
              possible modes of operation, and study potential packaging approaches and their
              effects on performance.    Commercial applications of resonant tunneling strain
              sensor technology are expected to be large and numerous in miniaturized, highly
              sensiive sensors for both industrial and military purposes.  Applications
              include strain sensors, acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, accelerometers,
              seismic sensors, and various varioussensors capable of remote operation.
