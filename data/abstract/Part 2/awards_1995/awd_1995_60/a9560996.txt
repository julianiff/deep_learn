Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the
              fundamental problem with the application of force feedback in immersive
              environments, which is immobility. The problem is addresssed by proposing an
              extreme innovation in force feedback technology: hand-held, spatially
              unrestricted force feedback. The state of-the-art in force feedback devices are
              table mounted. These devices require mounting to generate leverage for
              forces/torques and to support large masses. Consequently, no existing force
              feedback devices allow mobility and force generation concurrently. This is a
              fundamental problem since many virtual reality applications require large
              working volumes and the ability to move freely within the volumes. Currently,
              the most immersive virtual reality systems provide realistic visual and audio
              feedback during walk through scenarios. These large environments lack one
              primary component, haptic feedback, primarily because the current technology
              will not support unrestricted motion. The proposed innovation is fundamental
              for the use of force feedback in future human-computer interactions, better
              known as virtual reality.       The development of the proposed innovation will
              have significant commercial success. Immersive force feedback has lagged behind
              other virtual reality technologies such as visualization and tracking. The
              proposed project will advance force feedback such that it can easily be
              integrated with existing commercial applications.
