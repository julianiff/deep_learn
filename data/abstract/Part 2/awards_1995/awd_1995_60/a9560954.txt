Abstract    :
              9560954  Oxley         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              aims to establish the feasibility of improved copper-base alloys as inert,
              oxygen evolving anodes for aluminum electrowinning from molten
              cryolite-alumina. The search for an inert anode has previously focused mainly
              on ceramic oxides, cermets and in situ formed ceramic oxides. The most serious
              problems with these materials are, (a) dissolution into the cryolite with
              subsequent contamination of the product aluminum, and (b) mechanical fracture.
              An alternative approach is to use a material which actually thrives in the
              hostile molten salt/O2 environment. This concept was demonstrated recently
              using metal anodes. This work included experiments with binary Cu-Al alloys.
              Under oxygen evolution conditions, these alloys should form stable, protective
              Al2O3-based films. However, the alloys exhibited only partial stability and
              suffered periodic film failure. This problem will be solved by using ternary
              and/or quaternary alloying additives to a Cu-Al base.       Retrofitting US
              aluminum smelters with inert anodes could reduce energy consumption
              significantly. Eliminating carbon anode use would also avoid formation of the
              perfluorocarbons CF4 and C2F6, greenhouse gases with lifetimes of greater than
              many thousands of years in the atmosphere. U.S. aluminum producers have
              committed to reduce emission of these gases significantly by the year 2000.
