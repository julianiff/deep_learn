Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Reseach Phase I project is addressed
              toward the isolation of antibodies which demonstrate catalytic properties by
              encapsulating cells in gel microdrops and analyzing using flow cytometry. 
              Fluorescent products will be retained within the agarose microsphere and cells
              of interest can be recovered for cloning or gene analysis using fluorescent
              activated cell sorting.  Successful completion of Phase I studies will lead to
              development of a rapid, automated method for isolating, analyzing and
              recovering cells producing antibodies of interest.  This novel technology can
              be adapted as a back end screen for recombinant and chemical libraries
              currently used in a wide array of applications.       Catalytic antibodies can
              be used to produce a virtually inexhaustible source of biocatalysts.  The
              ability to generate specific proteases would have a significant impact on
              biotechnology and medicine for use as therapeutics as well as industrial
              enzymes.  The total estimated worldwide market for catalytic antibodies is
              estimated to be in excess of $ 1.0 billion.
