Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for the Partnership for a Next
              Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program.  Automobiles capable of 80 miles per
              gallon (or the energy equivalent) and a range of 300 miles are sought at a cost
              that would be acceptable to typical American automobile buyers.       PEM fuel
              cells may provide the power source if a practical method can be found for
              on-board conversion of liquid hydrocarbon fuels to a hydrogen fuel which these
              fuel cells can use.  Presently available technology for converting hydrocarbon
              fuels to hydrogen is steam reforming.  This process is unsuited to use on board
              a vehicle for two reasons.  First, the steam reforming reaction is endothermic,
              meaning that heat must be generated and transferred to the steam reforming
              reactor, which is complex and cumbersome for on-board use.  Second, the
              hydrogen produced by steam reforming contains large amounts of CO and carbon
              dioxide and cannot be used in fuel cells without extensive purification.  Such
              purification is also complex and cumbersome for on-board use.       The
              technology under study in this SBIR project produces hydrogen via a modified
              steam reforming reaction.  This modified reaction is mildly exothermic,
              obviating the need to supply heat to the reactor, and it produces hydrogen with
              high purity.  Thus, many of the problems of conventional steam reforming may be
              avoided.  Phase I will include a series of experiments which will provide bench
              scale proof of concept for the application of the concept to on-board hydrogen
              generation.
