Abstract    :
              ***  9560150  Jannson         This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will provide an innovative method that can be used to solve
              multi-dimensional (4-D) inverse scattering problems (ISPs) in diffusion
              tomography, without artifacts.  Physical Optics Corporation (POC) will develop
              a new inverse technique with rigorously established global convergence, called
              the Globally Optimized Inverse Method (GOIM).  The GOIM is based on the
              globally convex cost function (and Carleman's estimates).  This will provide
              for the first time, the solution of time-dependent inverse problems in 3-D
              space for strongly-scattering media.  A backscattering inverse problem for
              Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is used as a quantitative example, and potential
              application scenario for Phase II.  In Phase I, POC will develop a
              time-effective inverse numerical technique based on layer-stripping procedure,
              applicable to real-life opto-medical, Radar, NDE and seismic scenarios.  Its
              features will be evaluated in the context of electromagnetic wave source type,
              specific technical parameters of a sensing device (including the grid structure
              of the boundary value set), and the computer power required (for either Work
              Stations, PCs, or parallel computers).       The GOIM can be applied to novel
              diffusion tomography (DT) devices that can effectively (i.e., with a minimal
              number of grid points) evaluate, for the first time, either backscattered GPR
              waves, or diffuse photons in turbid media; thus, providing an entirely new
              category of advanced DT devices applicable to nuclear waste monitoring, seismic
              activity monitoring, aging aircraft NDE monitoring, and early breast cancer
              diagnostics.  ***
