Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns
              the production of hydrogen fuel for use in Next Generation Vehicles.  Hydrogen
              is an environmentally clean fuel, but it is difficult to transport and store. 
              A low-cost method of producing hydrogen from natural gas in the 1,000-1,000,000
              scfd range is required, so that hydrogen can be manufactured close to the point
              of use.  This project develops a methane reformer fitted with a
              hydrogen-selective palladium-alloy membrane to separate hydrogen from carbon
              dioxide.  The process is expected to produce 99 percent pure hydrogen at low
              cost and operate in small-scale hydrogen production plants.  To be feasible,
              efficient high-temperature hydrogen-selective membranes are required in the
              process.  Palladium-alloy membranes have the required selectivity, but
              currently, such membranes are 10-25 microns thick and are very expensive for an
              industrial process.  This research explores the use of sputter-coated
              palladium-alloy membranes only 1,000 Angstroms thick.  These membranes have
              been produced in small rolls and have hydrogen/carbon dioxide selectivities of
              greater than 2,000.  The Phase I objective is to show that palladium-alloy
              membranes can be adapted for use at temperatures as high as 250 degrees C to
              allow high fluxes.  The membranes must also be mechanically strong enough for
              incorporation into membrane modules.  If approved, Phase II would scale up
              membrane production to industrial-scale modules, which would be installed with
              a small reformer to produce hydrogen in pilot-scale equipment.       These
              on-site hydrogen production units would make the use of hydrogen as a fuel much
              more attractive.  The systems are also likely to find an immediate use in the
              on-site production of hydrogen for users in chemical, metallurgical and
              electronics industries.
