Abstract    :
              9560408  Sullivan     An alarming increase in fungal infections has focused
              attention on the need to identify new compounds with antifungal activity.  This
              Small Business Phase I research project focuses on developing a rapid method
              for screening compounds for antifungal activity using gel microdrops and
              fluorescent activated cell sorting.  This technique provides a quantitative
              approach for evaluating growth and antifungal sensitivity.  Conventional drug
              screening, which is based on dilution and plating methods, is costly, time
              consuming and difficult to automate.  An additional benefit of the proposed
              method is the ability to recover microorganisms of interest for further
              analysis, such as gene sequence determination.   This project offers an
              innovative approach to drug screening.  The market potential for developing
              rapid automated susceptibility assays for screening drug candidates against
              infectious disease targets is significant.  In addition to screening cells on a
              fee for service basis, the company is also leasing CellSyTM microdrop makers
              for encapsulation and screening in individual research laboratories.
