Abstract    :
                95-60712  Yadav     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              focuses on developing significantly better varistors by the engineering of
              interfaces. The need for better varistors originates from the fact that almost
              all electronic devices are subject to noise and high voltage surges from IC
              integration, switching or electrostatic discharge. These surges and noises can
              severely affect the performance of electrical and electronic devices. Varistors
              based on metal oxides are commonly used to minimize this problem. However,
              current metal oxide varistor device technology is not well suited for rapid
              response, low voltages and high frequency applications. This program seeks to
              direct efforts to remedy this. The proposed technical approach is to synthesize
              and fabricate varistors from materials with very large interfacial area. The
              resultant varistors are expected to be dramatically smaller, lighter, and yet
              feature higher non-linear coefficient, lower leakage current, and higher
              critical electric field values. These advantages are expected from increased
              interfacial area, homogeneity, increased density, and potential quantum
              confinement effects. During Phase I, the proof-of-concept will be established.
              Phase II will develop, optimize and field test the varistors, and
              commercialization of the devices will occur during Phase III.   Proposed
              varistor technology can enable system miniaturization without sacrificing
              electronic component performance. Applications include varistors for protecting
              integrated LSIs, ICs, telecommunications equipment, electric power and
              transmission management, and for devices to dramatically improve reliability of
              energy and automotive electronics.
