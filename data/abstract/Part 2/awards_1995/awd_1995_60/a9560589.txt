Abstract    :
              9560589  Halverson    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate a low-cost manufacturing process for miniature thin
              film electroluminescent (TFEL) displays.  A TFEL head mounted display (HMD)
              will be based on passive matrix addressing and indium bump bonded drive
              electronics.  Passive matrix addressing is expected to simplify fabrication and
              improve HMD manufacturing by decreasing the number of high voltage drive
              transistors required for display operation.  Additional improvements in
              producibility are expected due to separate fabrication and test of the
              miniature TFEL panel and drive chips.  Ion implantation of multicolor
              activators through high resolution masks will be used to introduce luminescent
              centers selectively and form color pixels.  Miniaturization of the TFEL panel
              would allow high refresh rates and, therefore, a high-brightness display.   
              Low cost, miniaturized TFEL displays will be used in applications requiring
              hands-free transfer of information such as equipment maintenance, telepresence
              surgery, and simulators for training.  The largest potential commercial use
              will be high-performance virtual reality entertainment systems.
