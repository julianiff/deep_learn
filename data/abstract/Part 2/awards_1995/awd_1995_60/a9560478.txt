Abstract    :
              9560478  Lombardo         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project could significantly reduce the cost of radiological nondestructive
              assessment.  An inexpensive compact betatron will be used as a high-flux x-ray
              source for the purpose of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in civil structures. 
              The x-ray source would replace more expensive RF linacs and thereby reduce the
              cost of radiological equipment.  In conventional betatrons, eddy-current losses
              in the iron limit the frequency and the maximum field, thereby limiting the
              output beam power.  With the use of proprietary low-loss, high-frequency
              materials, it has been determined that higher driving frequencies permit much
              higher x-ray fluxes.  Radiological NDE requires just such an x-ray source to
              provide rapid, high signal-to-noise analyses.  Phase I will determine the
              necessary betatron design parameters including the electromagnet dimensions,
              the pole shapes, pole gap, and the optimum placement of the electron gun for
              injection.  Computer programs recently developed by Adelphi Technology, Inc.
              for the Department of Energy will be used for high repetition-rate betatrons.
              The analysis will attempt to demonstrate that an inexpensive betatron will
              provide the x-ray flux necessary to examine concrete structures up to 70 cm
              thick.       The proposed research will demonstrate the commercial and
              technical feasibility of an inexpensive compact betatron suitable for the NDE
              of civil structures.  Other commercial applications of such a betatron include
              cancer radiotherapy, medical imaging, microlithography of integrated circuits,
              and compact baggage scanners.
