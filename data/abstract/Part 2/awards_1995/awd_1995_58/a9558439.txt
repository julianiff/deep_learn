Abstract    :
              9558439  Newton  Protein kinase C transduces signals that promote phospholipid
              hydrolysis.  Binding of a wide variety of signals to cell surface receptors
              results in phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
              bisphosphate, producing the water soluble head-group, inositol trisphosphate,
              and the lipid backbone, diacylglycerol.  Both molecules are critical second
              messengers in the protein kinase C signalling pathway. Inositol trisphosphate
              mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ thus causing protein kinase C, which is present in
              the cytosol under resting conditions, to bind to the plasma membrane. 
              Diacylglycerol activates the kinase; activity also requires the amino
              phospholipid, phosphatidylserine.  The long-term objective of the proposed
              research is to understand the mechanism of action of protein kinase C. 
              Specifically, the role of diayclglycerol in regulating the enzyme will be
              addressed.  The hypotheses that 1) diacylglycerol targets protein kinase C to
              the plasma membrane, and 2) diacylglycerol is an allosteric activator of the
              kinase will be tested.  %%%  The effect of diacylglycaerol on the protein
              kinase C membrane interaction, and on the conformation of protein kinase C,
              will be addressed with the aim of understanding how this second messenger
              regulates the structure and function of protein kinase C, and in turn, signal
              transduction.  ***
