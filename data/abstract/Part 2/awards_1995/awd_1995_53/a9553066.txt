Abstract    :
              9553066  Li    This Presidential Faculty Fellowship award will involve primary
              synthesis,  structure characterization, and property studies of novel
              solid-state materials,  particularily the metal chalcogenides and carbides.
              Both experimental and  theoretical methods will be employed in these
              investigations. A focus on  teaching activities will include areas of chemistry
              including physical,  computational, and quantum chemistry.    %%%    The
              principal objective of this researc is to develop innovative routes to new 
              inorganic solid-state materials that can be shown to have novel functional 
              properties with a broad impact across many areas of strategic research. The 
              educational efforts are aimed at integrating research with education, making
              the  world of chemistry relevant through an enhanced knowledge of the world of
              new  materials derived by novel synthetic techniques.
