Abstract    :
              9553531  Najar    The California State University, Fresno will initiate a
              6-week, commuter Young Scholars project for 25 students entering grade twelve. 
              The disciplinary focus of the program is in mathematics with an emphasis on
              combinatorics, graph theory, group theory, and number theory.  Summer
              activities will include seminars, a computer short course, field trips,
              discussions of mathematics careers and the ethics of science.  Four one-day
              sessions during the school year will follow-up the summer component.
