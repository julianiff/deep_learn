Abstract    :
              9553846  Sadler    Spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and important
              analytical tools available to science and technology.  Used in many disciplines
              as a research tool, it plays little role in school science because of a lack of
              materials and techniques.  Due to technological advances easily available to
              schools, spectroscopy can now be used to demonstrate how properties of
              materials depend upon their molecular structure and also to address student
              preconceptions about the nature of light and color.  Since spectroscopy is
              concerned with light and color, it is an attractive way to engage students in
              scientific inquiry.  This project develops discipline specific and
              multidisciplinary activities, based on Project  STAR,  that address science
              standards, suitable for middle and high school students.  Products include
              activities, projects, teacher materials, an Internet-based database of spectra
              and an on-line support group.
