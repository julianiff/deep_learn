Abstract    :
              GER-9553458  Carroll  Virginia Tech seeks to establish a  Graduate Research
              Traineeships  program to encourage women,  minorities, and persons with 
              disabilities (Trainees) to pursue  the PhD in Computer Science with 
              specialization in Human-Computer  Interaction and Networked  Information.
              Unique program  features include:  * inter-institutional recruiting 
              arrangements with Norfolk State  University and North Carolina  Agricultural
              and Technical State  University (historically black  universities) as "feeder"
              schools,  and an aggressive plan for  retention of Trainees;  * practical
              experience and research  in five different settings       (1) three new HCI
              labs --  encompassing interactive  technologies, usability  evaluation 
              methodology, and networked  multimedia information, all created  under     a
              recently awarded NSF  Research Infrastructure grant;       (2) a wide range of 
              development and experimentation in  Computer Science    curricula,  course
              content, and instructional  technology, supported by a recently  awarded NSF
              Educational  Infrastructure grant;       (3) the Accessible Computer 
              Laboratory, Virginia Tech's  computer facility for    disabled  students,
              created and managed by  the Computer Science Department;       (4) the
              Interaction Consulting  Service, and outreach program to  help the  University
              community  learn, adapt, and apply the newest  HCI design and      evaluation 
              technologies to their development  of software and courseware;       (5) the
              Blacksburg Electronic  Village, an ambitious community-  networking    
              project;    * liaisons with foreign  institutions and the computer  industry to
              provide opportunities  for international and industrial  training experiences.
