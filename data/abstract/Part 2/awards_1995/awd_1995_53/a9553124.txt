Abstract    :
              Abstract  Clemens  CTS-9553124      The proposed effort centers on the
              fundamental studies of turbulence/flame and turbulence/diffusion interactions
              using planar laser diagnostics.  Turbulence/reaction zone interactions,
              stabilization mechanisms in planar lifted flames, and differential diffusion in
              turbulent flows will be targeted for investigation.  The studies will make use
              of laser imaging of flow field variables such as velocity, OH and CH radical
              concentrations, and fuel jet concentrations.  Velocities will be measured using
              particle image velicometry (PIV) and species concentration using planar
              laser-induced fluorescence (PLIV).  An emphasis will be placed on the
              simultaneous imaging of multiple flow variables such as velocity and OH (or
              CH), or two scalars with different mass diffusivities.  Information will be
              forthcoming which will be important for the development and validation of
              turbulent reacting flow models which seek to predict combustion efficiency and
              atmospheric pollutant levels.
