Abstract    :
              9553524  Wang    This proposal seeks support for a three week, residential Young
              Scholars project in Engineering for thirty students entering the eleventh or
              twelfth grades from Kentucky and the neighboring states.  Students will engage
              in a series of engineering activities including hands-on computer graphics
              mini-research projects, job shadowing and field trips.  These activities are
              designed to provide an integrated orientation to four areas of engineering
              including chemical and materials, civil, electrical, and mechanical
              engineering.  During the fall semester following the summer activity, students
              will complete a supervised, individualized project and will be expected to
              return to the campus for follow-up activities during Engineering Week.
