Abstract    :
              GER-9553609  Houde-Walter  The University of Rochester has a  long record of
              producing  outstanding PhDs in Optical Science and Engineering.  Students know 
              this, so there is an ample supply  of highly qualified U.S. citizens  that
              apply for graduate study at Rochester each year.  Student  support is in short
              supply,  however, and this severely limits  the number of doctorates in Optics
              produced by Rochester.  Should additional support become available through the
              NSF  GRT program, we can guarantee the admission of  additional U.S. citizens
              without in any way compromising the  academic excellence of the doctoral
              program. Three academic  departments, The Institute of Optics, The Department 
              of Physics and Astronomy, and the Department of Mechanical  Engineering, have
              joined forces to attract the GRT program  to  Rochester. Together we propose 
              several enhancements to our already strong programs. These  include  Optics
              training in technical communication, training  opportunities for GRT students
              as future mentors, and  international research opportunities for GRT students.
              We  have also developed several new approaches to  recruiting underrepresented 
              minorities and women. These enhancements will benefit the  GRT students and
              will improve the  quality of doctoral education in  Optics overall.
