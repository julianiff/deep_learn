Abstract    :
              9553517  Berken    St. Norbert College will initiate a three-week Young Scholars
              project for thirty Native-American students entering eighth grade.  The focus
              of the summer residential program will be a thematic one, Mother Earth,
              integrating mathematics and science.  The students will take part in activities
              that call for them to conduct experiments, make measurements, analyze data and
              work with computers.  Working with college faculty, local school educators, and
              Native-American mathematicians and scientists as role models, these young men
              and women will have the opportunity to build a solid foundation for a lifelong
              interest in mathematics and science.
