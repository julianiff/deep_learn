Abstract    :
              9553871   Foley    Reaching Every Teacher:  A Systemic Approach to Increased
              Student Achievement K-12    This is a 3-year project, at $899,815, by the
              Waltham Public Schools, in collaboration with Educational Development
              Corporation (EDC), to launch a multiyear, districtwide, systemic reform of the
              city's entire K-12 mathematics program.  The project will involve all 200 of
              the district's teachers of mathematics in 10 days of teacher enhancement in
              each of the 3 years.  It will focus on deepening teachers' understanding of
              mathematics,  help them view mathematics as a problem solving discipline,
              enhance their pedagogical repertoire, and promote cross-grade dialogue to make
              K-12 mathematics instruction an integrated whole.  The enhancement will include
              preparing teachers to choose curriculum materials wisely.  Administrators and
              parents are involved in the program, and local industries and universities will
              provide volunteers to substitute for teachers while they attend professional
              development.  The district reform model will be disseminated through the
              production of a manual describing the project with suggestions for adaptations
              by other small-city districts.  Cost-sharing is reported at 144%.
