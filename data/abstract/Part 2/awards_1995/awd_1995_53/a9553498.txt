Abstract    :
              9553498  Sheridan    The College of Notre Dame of Maryland is seeking funds to
              continue  an eight week project for a total of 80 rising seniors, including 
              young men and women from groups traditionally underrepresented in  science.   
              This Project is designed to engage students in a rigorous  laboratory-based
              program in biochemistry, biotechnology,  microbiology, chemistry, mathematics,
              history and ethics of  science.  Five of the eight weeks of the program will
              focus on  academic and problem-solving pursuits.  During the remaining three 
              weeks, students will participate in an Intern Program.
