Abstract    :
                   The project is a collaborative effort by six technical  institutes, a
              public land grant university, a state department of  technical and adult
              education, and industry representatives to  develop applications for multimedia
              and distance learning  technologies in Electronics Engineering Technology
              associate degree  programs in Georgia.  Forty-eight technology faculty will be 
              trained in multimedia applications.  A Curriculum Development Team  of
              technology faculty, industry representatives, and instructional  technology
              specialists will create multimedia applications for four  technical, math and
              physics courses in the electronics eneineering  technology program.  Project
              objectives target curriculum materials  development, faculty enhancement,
              student access through distance  education, and industry involvement. 
              Teaching/learning problems  addressed by the project include diverse academic
              preparation,  background and learning styles of students at technical
              institutes;  the impracticality of time and placebound instructional delivery 
              for adult students, the fast-changing technology and knowledge base  in
              engineering technology fields, and faculty need to diversify  teaching
              approaches and uses of instructional technologies  available in Georgia.
