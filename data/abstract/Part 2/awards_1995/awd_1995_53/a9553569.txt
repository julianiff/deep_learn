Abstract    :
              9553569  Sambrotto    This computer-based instructional package makes scientific
              information about the earth and its dynamic processes available to students. 
              EarthView Explorer provides students with direct access to scientific data,
              allowing them to design and conduct their own scientific investigations. 
              Students work in an interactive learning environment created though the use of
              computers with Macintosh and Windows-based operating systems.  Information is
              stored and accessed through CD-ROM and updated though linkages to the Internet.
               The project is developed for grades 7-12 and covers a variety of areas
              including earthquakes and seismology, the ocean and atmosphere, the biosphere,
              and climate.
