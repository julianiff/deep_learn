Abstract    :
              Rutherford  9553594    The publication of the National Science Education
              Standards and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy demonstrates a strong
              national consensus on specific learning goals in science.  However, developing
              a curriculum to help students and teachers become science literate requires a
              more diverse, but focused, set of materials than exists. Preservice and
              inservice professional development must prepare teachers to adequately evaluate
              and adapt curriculum materials.  Funders and policy makers involved with
              development and adoption of materials must align their decision-making
              processes with science literacy goals. A procedure is needed for evaluating the
              extent to which materials address Standards or Benchmarks.  This project is to
              refine an existing process for evaluating materials, provide an evaluation
              mechanism with examples and case studies, disseminate the process, and develop
              a cadre of developers, teachers and teacher educators who understand it and can
              advocate for its use.
