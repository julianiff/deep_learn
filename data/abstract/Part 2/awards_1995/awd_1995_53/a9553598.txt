Abstract    :
                9553598  Katims    The PACKETS Program is a system of classroom-based
              performance activities to be planned, designed, implemented, and delivered by
              the Educational Testing Service over a two year period.  These authentic
              assessment activities will promote learning and document that learning
              concurrently.  The two major goals of PACKETS are   to develop a model PACKETS
              program for students in grades 3-5 and to arrange for dissemination of the
              materials to reach as many classrooms as possible.    The development process
              is designed to ensure that the materials work well in a variety of classrooms, 
              with students and teachers from diverse backgrounds.  The process will include
              cycles of piloting, field-testing, and revising, relying heavily on input from
              teachers, students, and other practitioners.   Major national educational
              improvement efforts, including the Systemic Initiatives and the National
              Standards movement, place a high priority on integrating assessment strategies
              with instruction. As a result of this project, upper elementary teachers will
              have exemplary models of how to integrate assessment with instruction, engaging
              their students in meaningful, complex, and mathematically rich problems as a
              part of their regular instructional programs.
