Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT        The receipient has been chosen for a National Science
              Foundation Presidential Faculty Fellow Award.  The receipient will continue his
              research in the transport of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur through
              Arctic tundra ecosystems to include both physical and geochemichal transport
              mechanisms and pathways.  These studies will lead to a better understanding of
              broad environmental problems such as acid rain, eutrophication, species
              introductions, and climate change.  The research will lead to a predictative
              capability for ecosystem function to show how organisms react to each other and
              to human-imposed change.  Fundamental questions about geochemical cycling
              within organisms at both the regional and global scales will be examined.  A
              novel technique involving the use of stable isotopes will be applied at the
              scale of entire ecosystems and will be used to estimate the current carbon
              balance in arctic ecosystems.  Determination of the processes controlling the
              current carbon balance will allow the principal investigator to predict the
              changes that may occur during forecasted climate change in the arctic.
