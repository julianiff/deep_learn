Abstract    :
                   The Department of Defense (DoD) has funded the first-year  development
              activities necessary to create a two-year Community  College Associate of Arts
              Degree in Environmental Technology.   Kansas State University (KSU), as one of
              the recipients of the  funding, has assembled faculty teams to write the
              curriculum and a  media production team to produce and disseminate it. 
              Although it  was the original intent of the DoD, it is now apparent 
              subsequent-year funding will not be forthcoming.  Consequently, the  National
              Science Foundation (NSF) has a rare opportunity to fund a  program in which
              $840,000 of infrastructure is already in place.   For example, there are
              20-plus committed community colleges  prepared to implement the curriculum and
              develop second-year  courses.  A national consortium of industry supporters,
              such as  AFL/CIO, Boeing, and Allied Signal Aerospace, Inc., are on-board to 
              advise on program development.  State-of-the-art technologies, such  as
              satellite instructional delivery access, CD-ROM development  equipment, and
              media production equipment, have been purchased and  totally committed to this
              program.  Current funding from the DoD is  being used to develop curriculum
              materials, but second, third, and  fourth-year funding is absolutely necessary
              to implement the  curriculum.  Full development and implementation of the
              complete  two-year environmental technology program will not occur without  NSF
              support.  The proposal explicitly demonstrates the  infrastructures already
              created by DoD's first-year funding, and  clearly emphasizes activities
              necessary for program completion by  subsequent-year funding from the NSF.
