Abstract    :
              9553537  Shahin    The College of Misericordia in Dallas, Pennsylvania, will
              initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars program serving twenty
              students entering 10th grade in the summers of 1996 and 1997.  The disciplinary
              foci are in biology and mathematics, emphasizing the use of difference
              equations and matrices to analyze biological relationships in animal physiology
              and homeostasis. Students will interact with scientists, teachers, career
              professionals, and college students and develop an appropriate research
              proposal for an investigation to be implemented the following academic year.
