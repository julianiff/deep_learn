Abstract    :
              A  series  of  workshops  at selected sites  (4-5)  will  examine  effective 
              models  to  effect  cooperative  efforts,  as  regards  teacher  preparation
              programs, between faculty in the college  of  education  and  discipline  and 
              research  centered  faculty   in  mathematics  and  the  sciences; and between 
              these  faculty  and  faculty from K-12 schools.  The sites will be those which
              already  have  major  initiatives from the Institute and from DUE  and  so 
              have  indicated  a  commitment  to  fostering  such  cooperation.  Science  and
              education personnel from the Institute will  conduct  the  workshops  within a
              format that will insure a  report  which  includes the following: an inventory
              of current efforts in reform  of teacher preparation programs; a description of
              current working  groups; and a design for increasing effective communication
              among  the groups.  Dissemination of these reports will be encoupaged.
