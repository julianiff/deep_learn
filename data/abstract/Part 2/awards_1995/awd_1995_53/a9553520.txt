Abstract    :
              ***  9553520  Yuen    The University of Hawaii-Manoa seeks to initiate 6-week,
              summer residential, Young Scholars program in the agricultural sciences for 26
              students entering grades 11 and 12.  The Pacific Region Program (PRP) will
              select students from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, and the
              interrelated components:  classroom presentations, field trips, research with
              mentors, and small group activities.  During the summer students will conduct
              research porojects under the guidance of scientists and learn how science is
              used to solve real-world problems.  In the follow-up sessions during the
              academic year, Hawaii students will communicate with American Pacific students
              via PEACESAT, an international satellite communication network.  ***
