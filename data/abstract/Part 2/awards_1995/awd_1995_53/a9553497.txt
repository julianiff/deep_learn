Abstract    :
              9553497    9553497  Acevedo    The University of the Sacred Heart will initiate
              a five-week, summer residential, Young Scholars project for 15 students
              entering grades 9-12. The project focus is interdisciplinary and will stress
              the acquisition of research skills and awareness of environmental issues.
              Participants are exposed to a broad range of scientific issues through
              conferences, lectures and interacting with practicing scientists in different
              scientific fields. Students work on and complete research projects in the
              summer and academic year follow-up portion of the project. Ethics and
              philosophy of science activities along with career explorations complete the
              program.
