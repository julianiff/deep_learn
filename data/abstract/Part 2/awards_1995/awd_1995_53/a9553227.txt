Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is twofold: research in the area of signal 
              reconstruction, and teaching in signal processing, both components  emphasizing
              on the interdisciplinary aspect of signal processing.   The main thrust of the
              research is the reconstruction of a signal  with unknown statistical
              description that propagates through a  system with unknown characteristics,
              solely from the system's  output (blind deconvolution).  Higher Order
              Statistics are powerful  mathematical tools to be employed in this problem,
              capable of  revealing a wealth of information about the signal/process (e.g., 
              phase, presence of nonlinearities), and at the same time  suppressing noise. 
              The theoretical developments of this work will  be applied in the areas of
              digital communications, medical  diagnostics and earthquake engineering, and
              are expected to bring  new knowledge to these fields.  In the area of teaching
              the goal is  to develop and maintain a new systems curriculum, highlighting 
              principles that unite different engineering disciplines.  Towards  this goal, a
              state-of-the-art multimedia signal processing  laboratory will be developed,
              and new courses will be designed.
