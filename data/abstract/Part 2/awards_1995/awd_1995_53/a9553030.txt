Abstract    :
              9553030  Deng  This is a NSF Presidential Faculty Fellow Award.      Through
              photosynthesis, light provides the energy source for plants and, ultimately,
              for all living organisms.  In response to a fluctuating environment, nonmotile
              plants are able to sense varying light signals and to optimize growth and
              development.  Higher plants possess sophisticated photosensory and largely
              uncharacterized signal transduction and itegration systems to monitor the
              direction, quantity and quality of light signals and to adjust their growth and
              development accordingly.  This award will enable Dr. Deng to pursue those
              research directions which are important to understand the molecular and
              cellular mechanisms of light control of plant development, and to explore new
              research directions as science dictates.    As a Presidential Faculty Fellow,
              Dr. Deng is expected to be involved in the training of the next generation of
              scientists and in activities that will increase scientific literacy of
              undergraduate student populations.
