Abstract    :
              9553515  LeBlanc    This proposal seeks support for a three week residential,
              Young Scholars project in chemical engineering for 40 students entering grades
              eleven and twelve.  The workshop will be located at the University of Toledo
              and has been designed to introduce high school students to career opportunities
              available to them in engineering.  The workshop will involve a variety of
              experiences including laboratory experimentation, hands-on computer
              instruction, independent group investigations and field trips.  Follow-up
              activities planned for the academic year include conducting planned engineering
              experiments in the participants' home schools.
