Abstract    :
              9553579  Borasi    The University of Rochester (NY) targets all 48 middle school
              mathematics teachers in four area schools in an experimental model for Local
              Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics.   The four-year
              project has a concomitant "research in practice" component involving the
              ethnographic study of the reform efforts undertaken by the four schools and a
              comprehensive evaluation of the outcomes of such efforts.  The research is
              expected to yield both basic and applied findings about "best practices" for
              systemic reform in mathematics, especially at the middle school level.      
              The teacher enhancement component includes introductory and advanced summer
              institutes and academic year inservice activities that support teachers and
              school administrators as they build a shared vision for school mathematics and
              that enable teachers to implement four of the NSF-funded middle school
              curriculum projects (Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, Mathematics in
              Context, Connected Mathematics, and MMAP).   Each of the 48 teachers receives
              at least 140 hours of professional development.  Of these 48, 8 lead teachers
              receive a minimum of 220 hours of professional development.    Project
              evaluation addresses (1) the quality and effectiveness of the teacher
              enhancement component, (2) outcomes of the systemic reform efforts promoted in
              the four target schools, (3) the rigor and significance of the associated
              research.      Estimated cost-sharing from the University of Rochester,
              SUNY/Geneseo, Twelve Corners Middle School, Merton Williams Middle School,
              Honeoye Falls-Lima Middle School, Ada Cosgrove Middle School, and individual
              partners represents 165% of the NSF award amount.
