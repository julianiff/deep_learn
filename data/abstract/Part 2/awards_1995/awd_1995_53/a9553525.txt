Abstract    :
              9553525  Kohser    This proposal seeks support for a two-phase, four week,
              multidisciplinary, summer residential Young Scholars institute in engineering
              and earth sciences for twenty students entering the twelfth grade. 
              Approximately 120 high school seniors will attend the one week program (40
              students/week for three weeks).  The primary goal of this component of the
              program will be to present career opportunities in disciplines relating to
              minerals, materials, energy, and the environment.  Twenty students from this
              group will be invited to return for a three week intensive workshop consisting
              of intensive and individualized projects.  Follow-up activities will consist of
              supervised completion of individualized projects including a competition award
              for the best project essays.
