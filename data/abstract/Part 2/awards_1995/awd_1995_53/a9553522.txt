Abstract    :
              9553522  Abernethy    This proposal seeks support for a four week, residential
              Young Scholars program in computer science for thirty students entering grades
              11 and 12.  The program is designed to introduce students to computing as a
              scientific discipline by immersing them in computer science-oriented research
              projects from four primary areas: image processing, neural networks, scientific
              data visualization, and research issues associated with the Internet.  A
              primary goal of the project is to assist students in expanding their
              perspective of the computing sciences from a conventional programming paradigm
              toward a broader theoretical and research-based approach to computing.  The
              program will also include follow-up activities consisting of continuation of
              work on research projects initiated during the school year, making a
              presentation on their summer experience to students at their home school, and a
              one day Fall workshop on the Furman campus.
