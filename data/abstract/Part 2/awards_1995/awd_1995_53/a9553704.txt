                        Title: Mathematics for Technology - Laboratory Investigations        
                  Mathematics faculty at Wentworth Institute of Technology have  been
              employing active learning strategies characteristic of the  calculus reform
              movement at all levels of mathematics courses for  students of engineering
              technology since 1989.  This student  population is motivated primarily by
              perceived relevance of subject  matter to specific technical problems.        
              We propose to develop, through joint efforts of mathematics  and technical
              faculty, laboratory investigations using engineering  laboratories and
              multi-media simulations that will illustrate and  teach mathematical concepts. 
              The project will begin at the  intermediate algebra/trigonometry level and
              continue through  calculus.  50 sections per year, containing 1500 students,
              will be  affected at Wentworth.         Through an existing network of Tech
              Prep consortia, Wentworth  will take the lead in extending the secondary level
              "integrated  curriculum" reforms of Tech Prep to the college level.  
              Collaboration among faculty from Wentworth and neighboring colleges  and
              secondary schools involved in Tech Prep, as well as selected  industry
              personnel, will result in a series of workshops and  minicourses to disseminate
              materials and methods developed at  Wentworth to mathematics teachers at New
              England area institutions,  affecting a potential 25,000 Tech Prep students.   
                   The Wentworth project will serve as a national model for  colleges of
              engineering technology in integrating the learning of  mathematics with
              technical applications.  Through the American  Society for Engineering
              Education (ASEE) and the American  Mathematical Association of Two-Year
              Colleges (AMATYC), a potential  100,000 additional students ma y ultimately be
              affected.
