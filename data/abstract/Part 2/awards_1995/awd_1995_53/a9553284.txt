Abstract    :
              9553284  Nielsen-Gammon         Dr. Nielsen-Gammon is an outstanding young
              faculty member who  has been selected as a Presidential Faculty Fellow.  His
              research  involves investigations, through observational analyses and model 
              simulations, of the structure and dynamics of a wide range of  atmospheric
              phenomena, with emphasis on upper-tropospheric troughs  and symmetric
              instability.  His educational activities involve  innovative approaches to
              teaching in freshman seminars to graduate  courses, extensive use of hands-on
              computer-based diagnostic tools  and Internet resources, and the development of
              multi-disciplinary  course materials.
