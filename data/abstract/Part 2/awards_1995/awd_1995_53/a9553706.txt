Abstract    :
                   In recognition of the importance of complex technologies to  the future of
              the United States' economy, the Colorado Community  Collegeland Occupational
              Education System (CCCOES) proposes to  establish the Rocky Mountain Advanced
              Technology Education Center  (RATEC).  The purpose is to provide a
              comprehensive educational  center to ensure response to the region's identified
              needs to  provide resources to insure:  well-educated mathematics, science  and
              engineering technicians; effective development of new  educational
              technologies, internationally competitive  manufacturing; and integration of
              current research into advanced  technical education.  Collaboration for RATEC
              will include:  K-12  schools, colleges, universities, business, industry, and 
              government.  RATEC will disseminate information and provide  in-service
              programs in Colorado with invitations issued to states  throughout the Rocky
              Mountain Region and the nation.  The system of  community colleges--utilizing
              its centralized HEAT Campus--will  coordinate and disseminate curricula and
              other educational  products.  The five technologies are:  Community College of
              Aurora,  Metrology:  Community College of Denver, Precision Machining; Front 
              Range Community College, Environmental Science; Pueblo Community  College,
              Manufacturing; and Red Rocks Community College,  Biotechnology.
