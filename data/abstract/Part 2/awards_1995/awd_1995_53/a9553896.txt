Abstract    :
                9553896  Zubrowski    The project will develop a set of video and print
              materials to inform and support teachers' understanding of hands-on elementary
              science teaching and learning.  The materials are designed for use in
              in-service teacher education, preservice education, science center or museum
              training, and community-based programs.  The project will build on work of a
              previous NSF-supported project by Zubrowski that is producing a series of eight
              video tapes that depict students engaged in the free exploration of various
              science phenomena.  The follow-up project, in response from reactions from
              teachers and teacher educators using the pilot material, will produce four
              half-hour videos that will illustrate a complete teaching/learning cycle where
              students explore a single phenomenon and continue on to develop and apply
              conceptual understanding related to the phenomenon.  In the new material, the
              students will interact with materials and phenomena in a design
              engineering/inquiry science investigation.
