Abstract    :
              Brainard  9553430    Mentoring programs, albeit loosely defined, have become a
              popular national "cure-all" for  recruitment and retention issues for women and
              minorities in science and engineering in both  academic and corporate
              environments.  The goal of this project is to enhance retention rates of 
              females pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering by improving
              the current  practices of mentoring programs through training.  The effort
              builds upon the successful WIE  Undergraduate Mentoring Program at the UW.  The
              project proposes:  to develop and formalize  the existing effort into a
              comprehensive, stand-alone Mentoring Training Program for women  in
              engineering; to test the program on undergraduate and graduate students,
              faculty and  professional scientists and engineers at two institutions to
              determine the feasibility of transferring  the model to other institutions; and
              to package and disseminate the Mentoring Training Program  nationally.    The
              program will focus upon intensive learner-centered training on how to be a
              mentor and how  to be a mentee, with separate manuals for students, faculty,
              and other professionals.  Graduate  students will be added to the student
              population targeted.  The program will be modified based  on findings from
              pilot testing.  An external evaluator will evaluate the effort.  ***
