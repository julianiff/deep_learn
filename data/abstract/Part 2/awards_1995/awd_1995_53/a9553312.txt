Abstract    :
              The major objectives of the Talladega College Summer Science Camp  (TCSSC)
              program are: 1) to improve basic science skills of middle  school participants;
              2) to determine science interest and aptitude  of middle school participants;
              3) to make precollege (middle  school) students aware of the course of study,
              and the mechanisms  and processes necessary to reach and succeed in science; 4)
              to  reach out to and guide precollege (middle school) students into  courses of
              study leading to careers in science by, in part,  exposing them to role models.
                 In order to achieve the objectives above, a series of activities  have been
              designed.  If funded they will involve:     o    field trips to various sites
              of scientific interest    o    involvement in hands on scientific
              experimentation    o    lectures and seminars by role models    o    short
              courses in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics. Physics &       Computer Science
