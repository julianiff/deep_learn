                              Title: The Southeast Michigan Alliance for Reinvestment in     
                  Technological Education (SMARTE) Project    Alliance Members:         
              There are seven community colleges who are part of SMARTE         (Southeastern
              Michigan Alliance for Reinvestment in         Technological Education).  The
              Alliance also represents K-12         school systems, a major state university,
              community-based         organizations, government agencies, labor, business,
              and         industry interests in southeastern Michigan.    Overall Goal of the
              Project         1. Develop a SCANS based model for manufacturing program,      
                which will map the standards in each of the three disciplines:        
              product design, industrial controls, and manufacturing.         Specific tasks
              to be accomplished will be involve:          identification of skill standards
              which relate to engineering         technologies, organize workshops to review
              skill standards,         create model competencies, study professional
              organization         certification procedures, and provide access to the       
               information on curriculum, and certification via WWW SMARTE         alias.    
                    2. Establish pilot enrichment programs for students that will        
              begin preparation for coursework in the technologies as early         as
              elementary school grades. This would result in holding at         least one
              two-week intensified summer institute for the local         public school
              students, and at least two workshops at         community college sites to
              encourage elementary and middle         school students primarily minorities
              and females into         technology fields.           3. Develop curriculum in
              product design, and this curriculum         will be shared with faculty and
              teachers of the conso rtium         through a "hands-on" workshop.
