Abstract    :
              For four weeks during the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998, Jackson  State
              University will conduct the JSU-Summer Science Camps for  fifty rising seventh
              and eighth grade black students.  The students  will be exposed to life
              science, physical science, mathematics,  computer science, and communication
              skills in an intensive four-  week residential summer session.  This exposure
              will take the form  of classroom instruction and laboratory activities, e.g., 
              demonstrations and experiments.  These activities will involve  individual as
              well as group interaction with communication skills  (oral and written),
              applications of mathematical concepts, computer  applications, and laboratory
              experimentation and demonstrations.    Participants will identify either an
              individual or group science  project with guidance from faculty mentors.  Once
              the project has  been identified the faculty will work with students in four
              major  areas--research, laboratory work, problem-solving, and computer  skills.
               Students will attend seminars and go on field trips.  This  will provide
              opportunities to interact with practicing scientist  and observe activities at
              the planned site visits.    During the school year, students will come to
              Jackson State  University once a month on a Saturday to participate in
              scheduled  activities and continue to develop their science fair project with 
              assistance from their faculty mentor.  ***
