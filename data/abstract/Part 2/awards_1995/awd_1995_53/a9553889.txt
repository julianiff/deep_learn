Abstract    :
              This project was originally submitted to the Research and Learning program and
              has been transferred to the Studies and Indicators program.  It has been
              evaluated as a study of the reform of mathematics.  The purpose of this project
              is to document the impact of a particular effort to reform mathematics
              curriculum (Mathematics in Context) for grades 5 to 8 on the mathematical
              performance of students.  The project will examine changes in student
              performance over time and compare their results with similar students in
              different programs.  A four-year longitudinal study with comparative features
              will be conducted in four schools in three urban school districts and three
              districts.  The sites will be chosen site will use the Mathematics in Context
              curriculum and two will use a traditional curriculum. Indicator of the
              variables that will yield information about the teaching of the curriculum and
              its impact on student performance.  the study will produce technical reports,
              and articles to inform educators, policy makers, and parents.
