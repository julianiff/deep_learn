Abstract    :
              GER-9553465  Levin  A new Program in Technologies for  Learning will provide an
              innovative  learning environment for Graduate  Research Trainees, who will draw
               from five major centers of strength  at the University of Illinois:  theories
              of teaching and learning  of science and mathematics; content  area studies of
              science,  mathematics and engineering;  technology development; school-  based
              research; and technology  studies. The Trainees, who will be  advised by
              world-class researchers  in these areas, will study and do  research within the
              context of all  five centers of strength, and will  serve as mediators for
              developing  both their own expertise and a  broader contribution to the 
              knowledge necessary for improving  science and mathematics education.  Trainees
              will participate in a wide  range of cutting-edge research  efforts at the
              University of  Illinois in technologies for  learning, many of which are
              already  supported by NSF.
