Abstract    :
              9553895  Walker    This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a
              consortium  "Building Bridges to the Future."  Extensive collaboration and 
              commitment from the three school districts (West Windsor-  Plainsboro, Ewing
              and Lawrence Township) is evidenced by the fact  that the three district
              supervisors will each commit 50% of their  time to managing the project.  The
              Building Bridges partnership  consists of the three districts and seven
              research and development  centers including American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers
              Squibb and Union  Camp.  Additional science and education expertise will be
              provided  by faculty from Princeton University, scientists from Sigmi Xi, the 
              American Physical Society (APS) and AAAS, Trenton, N.J.    When this staff
              development initiative is completed every  elementary teacher including ESL,
              bilingual and special education  teachers in all three districts will be
              employing the inquiry  approach to the teaching of elementary science grades
              K-6.  The 5  year project will target 574 teachers in 15 schools.  40 mentor 
              teachers will be assigned to school districts in proportion to  size.  26
              volunteer teachers have already begun to pilot FOSS,  Insights and STC science
              modules in their classrooms.  They will  then make recommendations for adoption
              by the school board.    Total Request of $1,722,000 is from NSF.  Cost Share is
              $5,292,078.
