Abstract    :
              GER-9553623  Brown  Aspiring scientists will be trained  at the University of
              New Mexico  (UNM) to investigate questions of  complexity, scale, and spatial
              and  temporal variation in ecological  systems. These students will be 
              recruited from underrepresented  groups and populations with unusual  academic
              backgrounds. They will be  supported in their efforts to  pursue
              individualized,  multidisciplinary, and  collaborative thesis research 
              projects through the provision of  brad-minded faculty advisors,  theoretical
              and empirical training,  and the mathematical, statistical,  and analytical
              tools they need to  investigate a wide array of basic  and applied
              environmental problems.  These students will augment the  existing pool of
              graduate students  at UNM, many of who were drawn to  UNM because of its strong
              research  programs in population and  community ecology, landscape and 
              ecosystem ecology, biogeography,  evolution, systematics, and  behavior or due
              to the  opportunities provided by UNM's NSF-  LTER program (Sevilleta station) 
              and multidisciplinary training  opportunities among biologists and:  a)
              computer scientists at UNM who  are developing state-of-the-art  software for
              simulation modeling,  image analysis, and signal  processing, and  b) natural,
              social, and computer  scientists at the Santa Fe  Institute who are studying
              complex  systems.
