Abstract    :
              The San Francisco Bay Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation, led
              by San Jose State University and San Francisco State University, will implement
              a bold program that will identify incoming freshmen, especially from
              underrepresented groups who are interested in becoming teachers. These future
              math, science, and elementary school teachers will be offered newly designed
              "core" and "capstone" science and math courses, careful mentoring by faculty
              and local teachers, hands-on teaching experiences, and tutorial assistance as
              they progress from their freshman year through their credential program and
              during their first three years as classroom teachers. Major components of the
              program are: 1) promotion of centers of teaching excellence and recruitment of
              future teachers from several target populations; 2) preparation of science and
              math majors entering secondary school teaching and of all students entering
              elementary school teaching; 3) extensive early field experiences; 4)
              tutor/mentor/advisor programs; 5) workshops for science and math faculty
              resulting in their significant involvement in curriculum reform; 6) revision of
              core science and math courses, and creation of innovative capstone/integrated
              courses; and 7) a support network for new science and math teachers.
              Approximately 4000 students per year will be impacted by this project.
