Abstract    :
              9553162  Laurencin  This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a plan 
              of research aimed towards the design, fabrication and  analyses of tissue
              engineered constructs for skeletal  regeneration using connective tissue cells
              derived from  muscle.    The teaching component of the five year project will 
              introduce new initiatives for greater engineering education  opportunities for
              African-Americans, a cross-disciplinary,  cross-institutional teaching program
              in biomaterials, and an  expansion of teaching and mentor arrangements for
              individual  students.  ***
