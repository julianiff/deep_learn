                   Project    This is a planning project to pilot the use of macro, industry-
               based problems to generate themes and sub-themes for the  mathematics, science
              and engineering technology courses in advanced  technology education programs. 
              The premise is that this will not  only make instruction take on a real-world
              character, but also  serve to show the interconnections of the various
              disciplines as  well.
