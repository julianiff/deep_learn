Abstract    :
              The  overall goal of this research is to establish a science  base   for  
              automated  assembly  by  analyzing  its   basic  components. The research
              involves development of  algorithms  and  interactive systems that analyze the
              low-level geometry  of  assembly  lines  and  their  components,  such  as 
              part  feeders, sorters, and fixtures.  An underlying theme is  the  use  of
              simple sensors and actuators such as light beams and  parallel-jaw grippers. 
              Although the hardware bears a  close  resemblance  to  existing   hard 
              automation  systems,  this  research   introduces  computational  methods   to 
               rapidly  configure and reliably control this hardware.  At  a  higher  level, 
              modular  components such  as  flexible  feeders  and  conveyor  belts are
              interactively configured  to  facilitate  the  design  and  evaluation  of 
              assembly  lines  prior  to  installation.   The  research  addresses  basic 
              theoretical  questions  such  as  the  complexity  and  completeness   of 
              algorithms  and  involves several companies  in  efforts  to  transfere basic
              results into industrial practice.
