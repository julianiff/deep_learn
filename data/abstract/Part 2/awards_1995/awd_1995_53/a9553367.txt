Abstract    :
              9553367  Urban  North Dakota State University will purchase an FT-IR/FT-Raman 
              system with microscopic accessories.  This state-of-the-art  spectrometer
              system will become a key instrument in the currently  forming new initiative,
              National Science Foundation Industry  University Cooperative Coatings Research
              Center and the Materials  Science Program at North Dakota State University. 
              The  spectrometer system will introduce systemic changes, providing 
              opportunities for new research and educational directions at  NDSU, and will
              serve as an inter-college and interdepartmental  unit housed in the Vibrational
              Spectroscopy Laboratory Cluster in  the Polymers and Coatings Department.  This
              spectrometer system  is requested by the inter-disciplinary group of
              researchers from  three colleges on NDSU campus, Science and Mathematics, 
              Engineering, and Pharmacy, appointed in the Departments of  Polymers and
              Coatings, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Mechanical  Engineering.  Included in the
              equipment is the hardware necessary  for implementing the system and all
              necessary software and  licenses for the system to be brought into service.
