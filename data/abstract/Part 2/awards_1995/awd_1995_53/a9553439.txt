Abstract    :
              9553439  Subramaniam    This is a research and action program that:  (1)
              assesses the field-specific policies and practices  in four departments at the
              University of Arizona that impinge on the recruitment, retention, and 
              advancement of women graduate students, and (2) designs, implements, and
              evaluates  intervention strategies to foster a more inclusive graduate
              experience.  It involves research on  the culture of science in a selection of
              labs, engages faculty and graduate students in facilitated  small-group
              dialogue about their differing perceptions of the graduate experience;
              introduces  them to literature on gender and the culture of science; and works
              with them, and with  departmental administrations to design and implement
              changes in policies and practices at the  laboratory and departmental levels to
              address problems that have been identified.  Participating  units include the
              Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Chemistry, Ecology and 
              Evolutionary Biology, and Mathematics, and the Women in Science and Engineering
              Program  of the Southwest Institute for Research on Women.  In contrast to many
              other projects designed  to address the recruitment, retention, and advancement
              of women in the sciences, mathematics,  and engineering, the project focuses on
              changing institutions to be more responsive to women  students, rather than
              instructing women in ways to accommodate to existing institutional policies 
              and practices.  The project will be carried out over two academic years and the
              intervening  summer.  ***
