Abstract    :
              9553566  Epel    This project is to provide high school biology laboratory
              exercises  to teachers over the Internet.  New mult-disciplinary protocols in 
              biology and cell biology are to be developed, disseminated as  supplementary
              materials and maintained on the World Wide Web and in  other forms.  The
              project is a model of how research laboratories  can efficiently share
              expertise with the nation's educators.   Concepts of scientific method and
              experimentation is to be taught  through modules featuring sea urchin gametes,
              illustrating  fertilization, cell physiology, cell division, embryonic 
              development, biochemistry, speciation, and the interaction between  organisms
              and their environment.  Teacher support is to be by way  of interactive
              tutorials and Web pages over the Internet.
