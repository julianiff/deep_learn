              Two-year Associate Degree in Agricultural   Technology             Hawkeye
              Community College is preparing to develop and  distribute the curriculum for an
              associate degree in Agricultural  Technology.  In the past two years rapid
              changes have occurred in  technology in the field of food systems.  Technology
              changes  involving biotechnology, chemical usage, GPS/GIS satellites, and 
              computer/telecommunication networks will continue into the next  century.  For
              farmers to remain competitive in the food industry,  they and the food systems
              sales and service people supporting them,  must be trained in this new
              technology.  "There will be fewer and  larger farm operations, still
              individually owned and operated by  families, but more businesslike...And to be
              profitable, the farmer  will have to use technology" (KSU AE REPORT, Fall
              1994).  Hawkeye  Community College proposes to plan and test an innovative 63
              credit  hour curriculum which would link the agricultural and business 
              experience with technology.  The curriculum and all support  materials would
              then be used in expanding articulation agreements  with the secondary schools
              and four year institutions including a  land grant university who are
              interested in updating agricultural  curriculum into food systems.  The
              materials would also be  disseminated through national education associations,
              journals, and  telecommunication system.
