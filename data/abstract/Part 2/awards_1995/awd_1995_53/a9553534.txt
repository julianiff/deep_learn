Abstract    :
              9553534  Peters      Indiana University will initiate an eight-week,
              residential, Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary science for 50
              students entering grades 11 and 12. The participants will be recruited from the
              state of Indiana. Students will learn about research methodology and career
              opportunities in various fields of science through lectures, field trips, and
              hands-on laboratory experiences. Students will be provided opportunities to
              work as apprentice scientists under the auspices of university faculty on
              individual research projects. Throughout the project, emphasis will be placed
              on philosophy and ethics of science, careers in science and mathematics, and
              the interrelationships of the various scientific areas.
