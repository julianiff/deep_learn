Abstract    :
              9553316  Peak          The National Conferences on Undergraduate Research (NCUR)
              is a not-  for-profit organization dedicated to encouraging and nurturing 
              scholarship done by undergraduates in all academic disciplines and  at all
              institutions of higher learning.  The catalytic agent for  NCUR's various
              programs in support of undergraduate research is its  annual, three-day
              conference that brings together some 1200  students and 400 faculty
              representing about 300 colleges and  universities from almost every stat in the
              nation.  In addition to  being the primary showcase for the intellectual
              achievements of  American's undergraduates, this conference provides a unique 
              opportunity to build communities of scholars.  In particular, NCUR  has a
              strong commitment to facilitating the networking of minority  undergraduate
              scholars with each other and, to help meet that goal,  NCUR has an avowed
              policy of providing scholarship support for  minority students with financial
              need to attend the annual  conference.  Aided by continuing funds from the
              National Science  Foundation, scholarships at the last six conferences have
              risen  sharply from 33 to 115 and total attendance by those designating 
              themselves as being of minority ethnicity now approaches 20  percent.  The
              funding requested in this proposal will permit NCUR  to continue to actively
              seek out wide participation of minority  students and faculty (in the sciences
              and engineering) at the  annual National Conference.  It will permit NCUR to
              develop  workshops and other activities at the annual conferences of special 
              interest to these participants.  And, finally, it will allow NCUR  to develop a
              database to assess the effectiveness of undergraduate  research participation
              in influencing the career choices of  minority students.
