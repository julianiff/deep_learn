Abstract    :
                  9553068  Johnson  The research agenda is to develop a new way of solving
              bioelectric field problems using computational steering. This involves
              integrating the basic scientific formulation of the problem and its
              mathematical model with the development of computational paradigms for its
              solution and with the engineering of computer implementations that allow
              interactive design and visualization of the results.
