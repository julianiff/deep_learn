Abstract    :
              9553369  Clevenger  The University and Community College System of Nevada
              (UCCSN) will  establish the Nevada Teaching and Research - Enhancement and 
              Collaboration (TREC) Program. The TREC Program will increase  research
              capabilities and support within the UCCSN through  strengthened interactions
              between the UCCSN research institutions  and the community colleges. The
              program provides mechanisms to  establish collaborative research and scholarly
              activities between  faculty primarily involved in research and those primarily
              involved  in teaching. The TREC Program will enhance community college 
              involvement in Nevada's EPSCoR activities by (1) identifying  research programs
              within the UCCSN which could provide  opportunities for collaborative research
              for community  college faculty; (2) identifying research interests and
              strengths  of community college faculty; (3) facilitating the match of 
              community college faculty with appropriate university faculty to do  research;
              and(4) establishing this as an ongoing process over  several years so that most
              research activities would occur during  the summer months, but regular
              professional interaction would occur  during the entire year.    The TREC
              Program will strengthen and enhance Nevada's EPSCoR  Program by increasing
              UCCSN Support for building the research base;  state budget support for
              research stimulation; the numbers of  professionals within the System involved
              in the research  enterprise; commitment to the development of Nevada's science,
               engineering, and technology infrastructure through increased  research
              capabilities; the potential for current UCCSN research  developments to be
              reflected in educational programs, thereby  enriching these programs; the
              number of UCCSN faculty involved in  research; capabilities within community
              colleges to meet the  educational needs for Nevada's diversifying economy,
              especially in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and; 
              professional development and renewal activities for community  col lege
              faculty.
