Abstract    :
              9553153 Ozturk  It has become clear that the future of the electronics industry
              will be based upon a new level of semiconductor manufacturing commonly referred
              to as nanoelectronics, which implies at least a factor of ten scaling in
              dimensions is essential to increase the number of devices per chip, and to
              provide faster, more power efficient chips.  In addition, it is widely accepted
              that future semiconductor manufacturing will be based upon single wafer
              processing, as opposed to present day batch manufacturing.  This transition is
              driven by demands for cost-effectiveness, as well as meeting needs for
              real-time wafer diagnostic incorporation essential in the manufacture of
              nanoscale devices and circuits. The research and education activities to be
              undertaken as a result of this award are focused upon state-of-the-art and
              advanced device processes and tools enabling the manufacture of nanoscale
              integrated circuits using single wafer processing models.  New processes and
              devices will be investigated for use in future factories, including atomic
              level engineering and selective processing.  New approaches to engineering
              education will include interaction with industry.
