Abstract    :
                  9553208  Hering    This is an award to provide support for research on the
              mobility  and reactivity of trace metals in natural waters and soils and  the
              removal of trace inorganic contaminants by water treatment  processes.  This
              research is a continuation of work she has been  conducting under National
              Science Foundation Young Investigator  Award No. 92-58431.  The teaching
              component of this award  addresses her observation that a serious deficiency
              exists in  education of students in chemistry and integration of this  exposure
              into undergraduate civil and environmental engineering  courses.  Her plan
              includes development of a one-year  introductory chemistry course that
              introduces students to  concepts from physical, inorganic and organic chemistry
              that have  applicability to environmental engineering practice.    This is the
              initial increment of an award to provide support for  this Presidential Faculty
              Fellow who was selected through  evaluation procedures conducted by the
              National Science  Foundation and based on criteria contained in NSF 94-134
              which  contains the nomination guidelines, review procedures and award 
              conditions.  Factors that control the transport and fate of  pollutants in
              aqueous systems are of interest because of the role  they play in controlling
              the movement and fate of pollutants  through aquifers, in treatment processes
              and natural systems.  Results of this research are expected to be applied in 
              engineering design of water supply, water treatment and pollution  abatement
              systems.
