Abstract    :
              Earth 2010-Your Future:  Population Growth and Environmental Impact  is a
              four-week residential camp designed for 50 seventh and eight  grade minority
              students from Missouri.  The purpose of the camp is  to increase participant
              awareness and knowledge of environmental  issues and how science, technology,
              and mathematics are involved.   In addition, the camp will provide career
              guidance and motivation  for students to remain in school and continue the
              study of science  and mathematics.  Earth 2010 will involve a detailed
              environmental  study of Stone, Taney, and Greene Counties in Missouri.  Stone
              and  Taney Counties are rural, forested counties which are host to  millions of
              tourists each year.  Greene County is also experiencing  an increase in
              population which is related to this tourist  industry.  This influx of people
              has caused a variety of  environmental problems (e.g., increases in energy
              consumption,  waste production, and construction).  Students will be provided 
              with the background knowledge necessary to identify, examine, and  propose
              solutions to selected problems.  Lecture, discussion,  extensive hands-on
              experiential learning, and small group research  will be the primary tools used
              to examine these topics.  Social  issues and political ramifications associated
              with these problems  will also be examined.  The issues in these counties will
              be  related to issues in the students' home areas and the world.  A 
              multidisciplinary approach will be used with six academic  departments from
              Southwest Missouri State University being  involved.  Earth 2010 participants
              will have science and  mathematics knowledge and experience to become active
              members of  their community in environmental issues.  ***
