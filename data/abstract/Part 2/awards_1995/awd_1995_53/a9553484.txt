Abstract    :
              9553484  Flatt    The current Operation SMART project has been very successful
              in  utilizing methods and materials developed for out-of-school  girls'
              programs to provide training and technical assistance to  public school
              teachers, as well as to enable students to  experience equity-based, hands-on,
              math and science activities in  their classrooms.  This award enables the
              Operation SMART project  to significantly expand its efforts to include an
              additional  600-700 students and 22 elementary teachers, largely in rural 
              areas, a population not previously targeted, and to focus on  project
              evaluation.      This training and technical project is designed:  (1) to
              improve  the performance and persistence of girls in science, math and 
              relevant technology, while influencing all students' positive  performance in
              these disciplines, and (2) to increase teachers'  use of hands-on inquiry, and
              problem solving approaches while  building confidence in their teaching skills,
              which involves  increasing their awareness of and skills in addressing gender 
              equity as a cultural issue.  An evaluation of the project will  include:  a
              quantitative analysis of the project impact on  students and teachers; a
              qualitative analysis of the project  impact on teacher attitudes, perceptions
              and implementation of  project activities; and an analysis of the process of
              developing  and implementing the project--ascertaining key elements, methods, 
              and players--the "who, what, why, and how."  ***
