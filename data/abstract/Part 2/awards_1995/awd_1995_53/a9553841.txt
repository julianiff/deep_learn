Abstract    :
              9553841  Greenberg    Image processing has been shown to be a powerful medium
              for engaging diverse learners, whose needs have not been met in the past, in
              the study of science and mathematics.  The technique is an effective and
              engaging way to study the applications of science and mathematics to real-world
              situations as represented by digital imagery.  It brings science research to
              the classroom; science is learned as science is done.  Students and teachers
              are lead into exploration, inquiry and analysis using real data sets and
              state-of-the-art computer tools. These supplemental materials, useful in middle
              and high schools are based on successful materials developed in teacher
              enhancement programs and provide a context for changing traditional classroom
              structure to a learning community.  Teachers are supported by on-line services
              and a network of professional development opportunities.  Subject specific
              CDROMs are produced in physics, biology and Earth science.  The standards-based
              activities are designed to meet specific learning goals and lead to creative
              student-generated products for performance-based assessment of student
              achievement.  Students also learn about mathematical concepts that underlie
              image processing such as coordinate systems, slope and intercept, measurement
              and statistics.
