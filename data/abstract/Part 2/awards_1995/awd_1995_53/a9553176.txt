Abstract    :
              9553176  Saha  This Presidential Faculty Fellow award is to a young
              neurobiologist.  Her research is on basic issues concerning the mechanism by
              which the brain develops from a simple sheet of cells into a highly complex
              structure.  The role of several genes in mediating tissue interactions are
              studied, using the frog Xenopus as a model system, with the major focus on
              reciprocal interactions between the nerve tissue and the blood vascular system
              during early embryonic development.  Her teaching includes neurobiology courses
              and courses to non-majors on the history of biology, an active outreach program
              to elementary and middle schools, and summer courses to high school teachers
              and gifted high school teachers.  The impact of both the research and education
              will be high and extend beyond neurobiology to science education in general.
