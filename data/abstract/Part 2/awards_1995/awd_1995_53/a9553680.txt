Abstract    :
                   The University of Alaska Southeast proposes a three-year  project to
              develop and implement the Rural Alaskan Sanitation  Education Program.  The
              project establishes a centralized  educational center at the UAS Sitka Campus,
              as well as a system for  dissemination of curriculum to teachers and students
              in remote  villages throughout the State.  The program is modeled on the 
              recommendations of the Federal Field Working Group on Rural Alaska  Sanitation
              Problems and represents a cooperative effort of  secondary/postsecondary
              educators, Native leaders, and those State  and Federal agencies responsible
              for environmental sanitation  programs in the State of Alaska.       The
              program addresses a critical public health need,  throughout Alaska and other
              rural settings, for sanitation  technicians and environmental scientists.  It
              is designed to  establish cultural awareness of the linkage between the
              environment  and public health, engaging village youth as agents of change.    
                The program will provide a cross-disciplinary curriculum in an  articulated
              2+2 tech-prep format for grades 11-14.  Curriculum  components encompass an
              academic core (math, written and oral  communications, social science);
              laboratory science (chemistry,  microbiology, geology, climate) and systems
              technology (hydraulics,  mechanics, electronics.       Students will complete a
              systematic program leading from  secondary diploma to postsecondary associate
              degree, along with  field experience necessary to achieve technician
              certification  under Alaska regulations for operation of water and wastewater 
              treatment, distribution, and collection systems.  An academic and  career
              counseling program, based on professional mentoring and  service learning, will
              assure that students completing the program  are prepared both for transfer to
              baccalaureate degree programs and  for transition into the workforce in rural
              Alaska.
