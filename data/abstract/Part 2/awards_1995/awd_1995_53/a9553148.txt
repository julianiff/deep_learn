Abstract    :
              9553148  Gajdardziska-Josifovska  This  project focuses on the study of surfaces
              and interfaces of metal  oxides  by electron microscopy and electron
              holography. The goals  are  to  solve  the  atomic  structure  of  polar 
              surfaces  which  exhibit  reconstructions  stable  in air, to elucidate  the 
              reasons  for  this  unusual  stability,  to  discover new reconstructions  via 
              systematic  study  of different oxides, to explore if such reconstructions 
              enable  growth  of  novel  epitaxial  films, and tm  explore  if  these  polar 
              surfaces  have useful catalytic properties. The educational  component  of  
              the   program   will  aim  towards  fusion  of   knowledge   from 
              electromagnetism, optics, quantum mechanics, solid state physics,  and  surface
              science.  %%%  The  long  term  goal  of  this  project  is  to  form  an 
              integrated  educational  and  research  program in  structure  and  properties 
              of  condensed  matter.  The  main  theme will  be  structures  of  ceramic 
              surfaces  and interfaces. Electron microscopy and holography  will  be  the 
              primary experimental methods. The scientific goal of the  project  will  be  to
              solve the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces  which  exhibit unusual
              reconstructions stable in air. While searching for new  surface 
              reconstructions, this project will attempt to  elucidate  the  reasons  for 
              their  stability and to explore if such  reconstructions  have  properties 
              suitable  for application  in  catalysis  and  opto-  electronics.  ***
