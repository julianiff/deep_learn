Abstract    :
              9553532  Rao    Mercy College will initiate a 5-week, summer commuter Young
              Scholars project involving thirty students entering tenth, eleventh, and
              twelfth grades.  The disciplinary focus will be in mathematics with an emphasis
              on students creating mathematical models useful in solving problems in the
              physical, natural, and environmental sciences.  The students will take part in
              field trips to area research centers not mnly so that they may interact with
              scientists using mathematical modeling, but also to acquaint the the students
              with a variety of careers.  Follow-up sessions will occur during the academic
              year.
