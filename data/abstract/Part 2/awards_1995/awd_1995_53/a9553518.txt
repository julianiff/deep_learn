Abstract    :
              9553518  Austin        Howard University seeks to provide enrichment experiences
              for a four-week commuter program in microbiology for 30 high-ability and
              high-potential 8th and 9th grade students from the school district of Prince
              George's (PG) County, Maryland. The program is conducted by the Howard
              University Department of Microbiology in the College of Medicine. During the
              four-week period the students will be introduced to concepts of microbiology
              and learn experimental techniques from research scientists, university
              professors, physicians and medical technicians. The students will engage in
              small group discussions, participate in field trip activities, and work on a
              research project.
