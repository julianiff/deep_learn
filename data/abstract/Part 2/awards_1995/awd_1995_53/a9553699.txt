Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks funds to develop an interdisciplinary  program for
              electronics manufacturing education that will provide  highly-trained
              technicians to U.S. industry.  A wide range of  activities that include all
              three subcategories of "Advanced  Technological Education Projects" will be
              necessary to meet this  goal.  First, associate degree faculty expertise will
              be enhanced  with industry fellowships, workshops, and seminars.  With better 
              understanding of industry needs, these faculty, along with a  practicing
              engineer from the Electronic Manufacturing Productivity  Facility (EMPF), will
              develop three new courses that are the basis  for a new degree option.  The
              laboratories which accompany these  courses will use facilities belonging to
              industry partners, the  EMPF, and the schools, along with equipment purchased
              under the  Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement section of this grant.  
              Additional activities, centering around the Mobile Electronics  Manufacturing
              Line and the EMPF, will link secondary teachers and  students with associate
              degree faculty, practicing engineers, and  technicians.  Such activities will
              allow for secondary teacher  enhancement and curriculum development.
