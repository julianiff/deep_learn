Abstract    :
                   Fiber optics technology has an ever increasing number of  applications, not
              only in industry, manufacturing and research, but  also in the home and office.
               Over 80% of the optical fiber in use  in the United States is employed in
              telecommunications  applications.  It is anticipated the industry will grow at
              an  accelerating rate as the demands of the "information super-highway"  expand
              into businesses and homes.       The New England Board of Higher Education
              (NEBHE) proposes to  administer and coordinate a series of regional two-day
              workshops,  one-week summer workshops, two-day technical assistance sessions 
              and a final one-week summer workshop, beginning in the fall of 1995  and
              completing in the spring of 1998, designed to increase the  number of high
              school teachers and two-year college faculty who  will include fiber optics and
              related topics in their  science/technology programs.  Special attention will
              be paid to  include traditionally under-served populations such as women and 
              minorities.  The project will link with the Regional Student  Network and
              faculty mentors that are part of NEBHE's Equity and  Pluralism project.  The
              project will include faculty enhancement,  curriculum development and
              laboratory improvement.  There will also  be strong participation form
              industry, including a co-PI, members  on an advisory committee, presenters in
              the workshops, development  of laboratories, site visits and possible future
              internships for  students.
