                      Title: Advanced Biotechnology Education Project    The proposed project
              seeks to develop an advanced biotechnology  training program that can serve as
              a satellite model program for  other community colleges in California and the
              nation. The  fundamental objective is to advance and broaden students knowledge
               and hands-on experience in the area of biotechnology.  The new  laboratory
              instructions will foster technical training and will  help students gain
              marketable skills for the workforce.
