Abstract    :
              9553349  Salamo  Research in optics at Arkansas is at a crossroads.  We have
              been  successful at competing on the frontiers of optics and are now  poised to
              develop actual optical devices and corresponding ties  with industry.  While
              our laboratory curiosity has led to many  demonstrated device concepts, the
              materials we use in our studies  are too big and bulky to attract interest by
              optoelectronic  industries.  They tend to be millimeter in size and are not 
              integrable into today's submicron electronic structures.  The  objective of
              this proposal is to make it feasible for us to  develop photorefractive
              nanostructure materials and bring our  expertise to the submicron world of
              optoelectrics.  This will be  accomplished by:          (i)   Adding a new
              faculty member to the Arkansas optics          program with experience in
              nanostructure fabrication;           (ii)  Adding molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
              capability to our          program;           (iii)  Forming a collaboration
              with a strong and successful          MBE effort with Professor Gary Wicks at
              the University of          Rochester;           (iv) Focusing our proven
              expertise in optics and micro-          electronics on opto-electronics.       
                 (v)  Developing ties with industry beginning with an          Advisory
              Board.    With MBE capability, we can control our own destiny.  Our ability  to
              open doors for collaboration with industry will be exceedingly  high.  Our
              ability to produce students with research experience  on the frontiers of our
              science would rise to new levels.  Our  ability to compete for federal support
              and to produce science  that will be noticed around the world will escalate.   
               Furthermore, our capability will be unique.  At the present time  there is no
              MBE capability in the state of Arkansas or in our  geographic region.  This
              proposed venture might even mark the  first time anywhere that both MBE and
              photorefractive science  capability will be under the same direction.
