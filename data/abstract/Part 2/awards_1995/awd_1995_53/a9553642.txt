Abstract    :
              9553642  Lewis  The Annual NSF EPSCoR Conference provides a forum for the
              exchange  of information between the National Science Foundation (NSF), 
              members of the state EPSCoR programs and many other parties  with interests in
              the EPSCoR program.  During the Conference,  progress and evaluation are
              discussed as well as opportunities and  strategies for the coming year.  The
              State of Wyoming proposes to  host the 1995 Conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming
              on September  29-29, 1995.  The theme of the Conference would be "EPSCoR: 
              Design  of a Partnership for Success".  The conference will focus on  issues
              that are important for achieving the goals foe EPSCoR.   Topics for discussion
              will include: 1) Assessment and evaluation  methods at the state and national
              levels; 2)  Individual state  programs and methods for success; 3) 
              Opportunities for  collaboration between states and federal agencies to further
               advance EPSCoR goals; 4)  Private sector involvement in EPSCoR  programs; and
              5)  Federal policy changes and their effects on state  EPSCoR programs.   
              These objectives will be met through a combination of invited  speakers,
              symposia, poster sessions and displays, and adequate time  for discussion. 
              Attendance at the meeting is expected to include,  at least the following
              groups of people:  Project Directors and  Administrative Assistants, State
              EPSCoR Committee members,  University Administrators, State Officials of Higher
              Education,  EPSCoR scientists, State Legislators, Private Sector members, and 
              representatives from other Federal Agencies and Programs.
