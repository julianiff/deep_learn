Abstract    :
              9553530  Thomas      Ferrum College will initiate a 3-week, summer residential,
              Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary Life Science for 33 students
              entering grades 8 and 9. The participants selected will be of high potential or
              demonstrated talent in science. The students will be involved in a research
              project on leaf decomposition in streams. This aquatic project will develop
              knowledge and skills in biology, chemistry, statistics, and computer use.
              Activities include classroom instruction, field trips, hands-on laboratory
              experiences, and academic career advising.
