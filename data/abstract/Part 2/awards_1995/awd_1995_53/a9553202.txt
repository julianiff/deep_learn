Abstract    :
              9553202 Si  This project will establish a joint research and education program
              between Arizona State University and Motorola.  This project will iteratively
              develop and test novel general-purpose designs for control and systems
              modeling,  based on adaptive critics (approximate dynamic programming) and
              recurrent neural networks.  For testing and evaluation, it will focus on the
              modeling and run-to-run control of the Reactive Ion Etching process.  A new
              course will be developed in electrical engineering curriculum on fundamental
              signal analysis and control applications to semiconductor manufacturing.
