Abstract    :
              ESI 9553908  Davenport, Linda     The Network for Inquiry in Mathematics
              Education (NIME) is designed to pilot a   case-based, professional-development
              curriculum which was created by teachers   and staff participating in the
              Teaching to the Big Ideas project.  Written for   elementary teachers, the two
              modules of the curriculum, Building a System of   Tens and Making Meaning for
              Operations, comprise a 48-hour course.  The pilot   has been designed to
              address the following questions:  What do teacher-  participants learn from the
              curriculum?  When participants in the course are   teacher-leaders, what do
              they learn to support their work in that role?  What   issues are faced by
              facilitators as they teach from the curriculum?  Our   findings will guide
              curriculum revisions.
