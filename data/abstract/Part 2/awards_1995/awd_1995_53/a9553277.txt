Abstract    :
              The Wildlife Conservation Society, founded 1895 as the New York  Zoological
              Society, requests a grant from the National Science  Foundation, to launch and
              exciting two-fold science education and  career exploration project for
              undeserved youngsters entering 8th  and 9th grades.  This commuter summer camp
              experience, serving 35  children annually over a three year period, will be
              held at the  internationally acclaimed Bronx Zoo and be based on one of the 
              exemplary and PEP1 validated life science curricula developed by  the Bronx Zoo
              Education Department, Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo  Education (WIZE).  To date,
              over 1,000 teachers in 40 states and  U.S. territories have adopted the
              curriculum in grades 7-10.  WIZE,  a science program targeted for adolescents,
              became available in  1987.  Initially funded by NSF, WIZE has been successfully
               disseminated nationally through two consecutive grants from the   U. S.
              Department of Education National Diffusion Network, and  continually evaluate
              over the past seven years.    The goals of Wildlife Conservation Society, the
              Bronx Zoo Education  Department, the WIZE curriculum, and the proposed WIZE
              Teens Summer  Science Camp closely coordinate with those of NSF's division
              Human  Resources Development:  We are actively seeking to: 1) promote an 
              interest in science and mathematics in middle school students that  will remain
              with them beyond their school years; 2 prepare  adolescents to understand and
              participate as informed citizens in  public policy debates and decisions on
              issues involving the  environment, habitats, and wildlife preservation; 3)
              encourage  middle school students to value and continue their science 
              education throughout secondary school and consider higher education  leading to
              careers in science, mathematics, or technology.  ***
