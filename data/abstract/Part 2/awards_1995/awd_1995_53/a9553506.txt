Abstract    :
              9553506  Florey    The University of Wisconsin - Superior will initiate a 5-week
              Young Scholars project for twenty students entering grades eleven and twelve in
              the summers of 1996 and 1997.  The disciplinary foci of the program are
              mathematics, chemistry, and biology with emphasis on the deposition of acid
              rain and mercury in Wisconsin and Minnesota lakes.  Students use exploratory
              data analysis and multiple linear regression to develop mathematical modelsof
              acid rain pH.  Students are introduced to ethical issues and career
              possibilities, as well as developing a follow-up research project.
