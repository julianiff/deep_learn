Abstract    :
              The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) administers, for the 
              National Science Foundation (NSF), the NSF Project Showcase.  NSF Project  
              Showcase is an exhibition of products and findings resulting from projects  
              sponsored by NSF s Division of Undergraduate Education.  NSF Project Show- 
              case takes place at the 1995 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition in  
              Anaheim, California, on June 25-28, 1995.  The NSF Project Showcase con-  sists
              of 20 booths in the exposition hall and will be set apart from the   rest of
              the exhibits.  The exhibit showcases 20 project, on two successive   days, for
              a total of 40 projects.  Each Principal Investigator will have   their own
              exhibit booth and will display the results of their NSF spon-  sored projects
              to the attendees of the conference.
