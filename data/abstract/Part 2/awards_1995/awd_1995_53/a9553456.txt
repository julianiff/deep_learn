Abstract    :
              GER-9553456  Vermaas  With exciting advances in plant  molecular biology, many
              graduate  students in the molecular plant  sciences have focused their 
              research efforts on narrow issues  that are currently in vogue;  examples
              include detailed  characterization of regulation of  gene expression or
              identification  of new genes. Consequently,  graduate students who are 
              interested in molecular biology of  plant systems often do not receive 
              sufficient training in important  aspects of biochemistry,  bioenergetics, cell
              biology, and  physiology. However, integrated  knowledge in these areas will be
               essential for further progress in  the basic plant sciences. This  proposal
              seeks to reverse the trend  of narrowing the research focus of  graduate
              students; an effort is  described in which 15 PhD students  will be trained to
              creatively and  synthetically integrate various  disciplines bearing on the 
              molecular plant sciences and  addressing critical questions in  the field.
              Several of these  students will be minorities. The  common denominator of
              research  areas described in this proposal is  energy transduction in plants. A
               major emphasis is on photosynthesis  and its regulation, as this is an  area
              of particular  interdisciplinary strength at  Arizona State University. Our
              goal  is to provide training that will  optimally prepare graduates for  truly
              imaginative and integrative  research in the molecular plant  sciences.
