Abstract    :
              9553648  Hall    This 36 month project will identify the knowledge and abilities
               that are needed in real life problem solving situations in which  mathematics
              is useful.  Special attention will be given to  organization of mathematical
              practices in school and work settings  where design is a leading activity.  The
              project will use case  methods to compare the activities of students working on
              design  projects with those of adult practitioners working in related  areas,
              as well as examining teachers' experiences in the preceding  work settings and
              in related classroom activities.  The project  will focus on qualitative
              reasoning and modeling in three types of  design-oriented work:  architecture,
              population ecology, and  cryptology.  ***
