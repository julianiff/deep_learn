Abstract    :
              Wells  9553701    Precision manufacturing, particularly tool, die and precision 
              machining and related manufacturing technologies including  plastics molding
              and metal stamping are important segments of  the Rio Grande Valley economy.  A
              new model educational  program to create skilled workers who can participate on
               workplace teams who do concurrent engineering.  The model is  based on the
              historical guild with master technologists and  students working side by side
              performing productive work in a  learning environment.  A consortium of other
              colleges and  local industries is developed.
