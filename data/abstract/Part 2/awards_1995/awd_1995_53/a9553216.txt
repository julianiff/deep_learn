Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9553216    Fundamental studies of the rheology of  complex fluids
              such as suspensions and polymeric liquids will be undertaken.  Special focus
              will be on measurement of two-phase flow mechanisms, investigation of the
              non-Newtonian fluid dynamics associated with the onset of flow stabilities in
              polymer processing operations, and their impact on ultimate structure-property
              relationships.      Theoretical concepts drawn from two-phase flow theory,
              polymer science and nonlinear dynamics coupled with experimental techniques
              such as digital imaging and electro-optics, will be integrated into the
              undergraduate applied sciences curriculum.  ***
