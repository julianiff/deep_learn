Abstract    :
                   This proposed project focuses on (a) bringing together a  coalition of
              educators, scientists, industrial partners, and  curriculum developers to
              establish a strategy for the TPAD  technician preparation program; (b)
              developing a curriculum to  provide "hands-on" enhancement opportunity to
              college instructors  in the area of biotechnology; (c) assessing the strategy
              on an  annual basis by the coalition together with outside expert advice  and
              input; and (d) collaborating with industry to develop the  required 2-year TPAD
              reagents and equipment.  At the commencement  of the project, the Coalition
              will meet to determine the most  effective strategy to initiate and address the
              project' s specific  goals and objectives previously outlined.      
              Undergraduate 2-year college faculty for the project will be  recruited locally
              for each of the summer workshops.  The emphasis  will be on the East and West
              Coasts, where the biotechnology  industry is concentrated and where the need
              for technicians is  greatest.       At the completion of summer workshops, the
              faculty  participants will complete a general evaluation and questionnaire.  
              The faculty practical implementation of experiments in technician  TPAD
              curriculum.  There will be a total of 102 faculty  participants, over a
              four-year period.       Other institutions which will participating in this
              project  include Seattle Central Community College, Cerritos College,  Northern
              New Mexico Community College, and Prince George's  Community College.
