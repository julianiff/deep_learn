Abstract    :
              9553423  Green    The phenomenon of science/math avoidance closes off chances
              for future career choices and  diminishes earning potential for young women,
              especially for Hispanic females.  To reverse this  trend, the
              Engineering/Science/Mathematics Increases Job Aspirations Program (ES.MIJA) 
              proposes to target 60 Hispanic girls in the sixth grade who have not made plans
              to pursue higher  level courses in science or mathematics.  Through an
              educational partnership with the University  of Texas at San Antonio/Alliance
              for Education, Harlandale Independent School District in San  Antonio, Texas,
              and the business community, Intercultural Development Research Association 
              (IDRA) will provide a support system that will promote Hispanic girls'
              continuing participation  and achievement in advanced science and mathematics
              courses and increase their career  opportunities.      The program seeks to
              achieve this goal through four components:  (a) curriculum, (b)  instruction,
              (c) professional development and technical assistance, and (d) support from a
              number  of sources, including parents and businesses.  IDRA also will be
              collaborating with the  University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)/Alliance for
              Education, as appropriate, in increasing  awareness of engineering, science and
              math in this population through mechanisms such as  UTSA's annual Expanding
              Your Horizons Conference.  IDRA and ES.MIJA also will be  working with UTSA on
              the San Antonio NSF-funded Urban Systemic Initiative.  ***
