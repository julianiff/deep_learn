Abstract    :
              GER-9553475  Kowel  UAH has created a multidisciplinary  doctoral program in
              Optical Science  and Engineering which admitted its  first students in the
              Fall, 1993.  This program addresses the growing  national need for advance
              training  in basic and applied optics. The  trend of strong integration of 
              optical components with electronics  is the basis of a vast new  technology.
              Our program was  developed to prepare students to  contribute across the broad 
              boundaries of traditional optics  including photonics.  The unique strengths of
              our program  derive from the support of the base  disciplines, physics,
              electrical  engineering, computer engineering,  materials science, and
              mechanical  engineering, as well as the strong  technology transfer activities 
              focused in the Center for Applied  Optics. A common facility for  research and
              teaching, together  with the shared doctoral degree,  provide an unusual
              concentration of  resources for our students. We are  working to strengthen the
               cooperative nature of the program,  involving the University of Alabama  at
              Birmingham, with particular  focus on biomedical applications,  as well as
              Alabama A&M University  (a HBCU), with a focus on nonlinear  optics and optical
              materials.  We are requesting five NSF Graduate  Research Traineeships to
              support  students for the first two years of  their studies in the program.
