Abstract    :
              Abstract: This project is a collaborative effort of the University  of Alabama -
              Birmingham (UAB), Auburn University (AU), the  University of North Alabama
              (UNA), and Miles College (MC). The  project features intra-institutional
              collaboration on courses: an  innovative course developed and taught by a
              faculty member in  Materials Engineering and a faculty member in Education for 
              preservice teachers at UAB will be disseminated to other  institutions. In
              addition, the project will support the development  of an analogous
              collaboration targetting General Chemistry at UAB  which involves faculty from
              Chemistry and Education. Inter-  institutional collaborations on teacher
              preparation programs will  also be supported and or developed. The first is a
              strengthening of  an on-going relationship between Miles College and UAB in
              which  students can cross-register for classes. The project will also  develop
              two new collaborations which pair Auburn University and  Tuskegee Institute and
              UNA and Alabama A&M.
