Abstract    :
              Evans  9553727    The Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies coordinates a 
              network of collaborative partnerships of Bellevue Community  College with the
              Boeing Corporation, Microsoft, other industries,   two- and four-year colleges
              and universities, tech prep consortia   and secondary schools to support high
              standard advanced  technological education in information technology and its 
              application to other emerging technologies. One goal of the Center  is to
              strengthen science, mathematics and technical curricula,  pedagogy and student
              support systems to provide the knowledge and  skills base required for advanced
              technological education.   Curriculum templates are designed to provide a model
              for  articulation of advanced technological education from high school  through
              four year college. The program also includes refresher and  remediation options
              for students lacking the college level skills.   A comprehensive system is
              developed attract and retain students as  well as monitoring and assessing
              their progress through core  competencies, job placement and career
              advancement.   A second  goal is to improve technological education through
              development of  courseware and the coordination of professional development 
              programs for faculty and for professional technicians.  Computer  technology is
              applied to core science and mathematics, as well as  to specific technological
              curricula.  The Center has strong  commitments of time, personnel and financial
              support from major  industrial partners.
