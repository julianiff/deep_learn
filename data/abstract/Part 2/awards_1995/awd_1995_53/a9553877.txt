Abstract    :
              9553877  Thier    THis is a four year grant to the Science Education for Public 
              Understanding Program (SEPUP) to develop, field test, and publish  a life
              science curriculum for middle school science.  The SEPUP  design is an
              issue-oriented activity-based curriculum that is  developed by science
              educators and scientists with continuous input  from classroom teachers and
              their students.  The curriculum is  based on major life science concepts as
              they apply to real-life  decision making by the individuals and along with the
              SEPUP  physical science curriculum, Issues Evidence and You, forms two  years
              of middle school integrated science.    The proposed curriculum has three major
              content areas, My Body and  Me-including reproduction and development and
              maintenance of the  human body; Living Partnerships-including evolution and
              ecosystems;  and Using Tools and Ideas - the ways which humans use tools and 
              ideas to adapt the external environment.  Four process-oriented  components,
              Scientific thinking, Personal and Societal Decision  Making, Science and
              Technology as Professions, and Futures Study,  is integrated throughout the
              curriculum.  The curriculum includes  embedded assessment that allows teachers
              to measure the growth and  development of students.
