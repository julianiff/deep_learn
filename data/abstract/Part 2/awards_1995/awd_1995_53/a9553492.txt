Abstract    :
              ***  9553492  Taylor    Arizona State University will initiate a four-week,
              summer residential, Young Schoalrs project in science, mathematics and computer
              science for 60 students entering grades 8 and 9.  Students from the Navajo
              reservation will be involved in an enriching experience in mathematics. 
              Students will be introduced to the experimental nature of mathematicvs and
              write computer programs to support the mathematics.   Field trips will be made
              to local museums, planetariums, and research laboratories at universities. 
              theics and career exploration discussions are also featured.  ***
