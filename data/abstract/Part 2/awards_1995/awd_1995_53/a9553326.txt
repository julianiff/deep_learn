Abstract    :
              Santa Fe Community College, in Gainesville, Florida, in the rural  north central
              part of our state, will provide an intensive four  week Summer Science and
              Mathematics Camp (SSMC) and follow-up  activities during the academic year for
              60 seventh grade African-  American students from the School Board of Alachua
              County School  District.  Students are expected to continue through ninth
              grade.    the goal of SSMC is to provide academic enrichment and career 
              exploration experiences to stimulate interest in science,  mathematics,
              engineering and related areas.  Students are actively  involved in doing
              experiments using the variables, length, area,  volume, mass, density,
              velocity, acceleration and force, and  probability and statistics.  Experiments
              provide problem solving to  facilitate understanding of the relationship
              between two variables,  functions and graphs, proportional reasoning,
              non-linear  relationships, measures of central tendency, and probability of the
               occurrence of events.  Students are required to write about the  process and
              results of each experiment.  Additionally, students  develop four-year
              individual career plans to facilitate learning to  articulate career goals and
              choose educational paths to accomplish  these goals.  ***
