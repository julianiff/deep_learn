Abstract    :
              9553902    diSessa    This project will investigate the strengths and
              limitations of students' meta-representational competence-that is, thier
              knowledge about representing scientific concepts and phenomena in a pictorial
              form. Foci will include student capability to: (a) design new
              representations;(b) to critique, compare and refine them;(c) to select
              appropriate ones and learn to use them efficiently; and (d) to understand what
              represents are for and how they work.  The project will investigate the
              relation of meta-representational competence to conceptual development and will
              also design and research classroom instructional activities that effectively
              utilize and develop meta-representational competence.  Results will help
              teachers better understand students' strengths and weakness in learning
              representations in mathematics and science, and will open up an attractive new
              genre of authentic scientific learning activities that can involve students
              have a wide range of intellectual styles and abilities.    ***
