Abstract    :
              9553542  Kahn    The Burke Museum at the University if Washington will develop 
              Pacific Voices, a 5500 sq. ft. exhibit that will focus on the issue  of
              cultural identity.  It will encourage visitors to examine the  definition of
              American cultural identity, the integration of  diverse cultural elements
              within American communities, and  questions regarding interactions between
              Native peoples and Euro-  Americans.  Four themes (Teachers, Elders, and
              Authority; Language;  Oral Traditions; and Ceremonies) will be developed to
              help visitors  understand cultural identify, tradition and change in the
              context  of Pacific Region cultures.  The extensive collections and 
              professional resources of the Burke Museum will be used and the  exhibit will
              be used.  Building on established linkages between the  Seattle school systems
              and the museum, the Burke staff will  introduce new teacher/student guides and
              a varied menu of teacher  training activities including for-credit courses and
              in-serviced  programs that will address the social science literacy benchmarks 
              of Project 2061.  Other outreach activities will include traveling  study
              collections, weekend family programs, a resource bank in the  museum's
              Department of Education and locally and nationally  disseminated radio and
              television news and feature programs related  to the theme of Pacific Voices.
