Abstract    :
                   Stark Technical College (STC) proposes an Advanced  Technological Education
              project in Environmental Technology which  will result in the development of an
              Environmental Technology  option within Civil Engineering Technology. The
              project will  address northeastern Ohio's business and industry needs for 
              technical expertise in environmental instrumentation, regulation  and
              compliance areas as well as waste minimization/pollution  prevention concepts.
              This need is critical due to the heavy  concentration of manufacturing in the
              region and the fact that  northeastern Ohio is the most polluted quadrant of
              the state. The  College's established ties with business and industry in the
              region  will facilitate the design of a program that will produce uniquely 
              qualified graduates who can help the public and private sectors  address
              growing environmental regulations and concerns. The AAS  degree curriculum will
              be tied into secondary Tech Prep programs in  the region and related bachelor's
              degree programs at Youngstown  State University and the University of Findlay.
              An integral part of  the curriculum will be advanced communications
              technologies which  will enable students (high school, two-year college and
              university)  to communicate with each other on collaborative projects. It also 
              will serve as the basis for an Environmental Resource Center (ERC),  to be
              operated by students, which will facilitate and enhance  instruction, as well
              as respond to business/industry and community  questions and concerns. A major
              component of the project will be  Summer Institutes and academic year
              follow-ups for teacher/faculty  enhancement in several key areas:  pedagogy;
              technical expertise;  and math, science and communications-related instruction.
