Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation and the Annenberg/Corporation for  Public
              Broadcasting, a private foundation, are cooperating on an  initiative to
              support national and international faculty networks  that can help individual
              faculty across the country to rethink  their own courses.  The curriculum in
              mathematics and sciences has  changed to incorporate student use of technology,
              and must change  more.  Professionals increasingly use computers, video and/or 
              telecommunications as tools of analysis, design, construction, and  research. 
              Students who do not learn the associated new skills of  thought are at a
              disadvantage.  In many fields, pioneering faculty  have made substantial
              progress in rethinking courses of study.   However, the work of these pioneers
              is often unknown, even to one  another.  Most faculty, even at institutions
              with the needed  equipment and logistical support, do not know what the leaders
              of  their discipline have accomplished.  In this initiative, project  teams
              will gather useful information about how selected courses of  study are already
              being improved at widely scattered institutions;  analyze that information; and
              widely share their findings through  data bases, on-line seminars, workshops,
              print materials, and  other media.  Heavy use of the Internet will be necessary
              in order  to reach large numbers of faculty.
