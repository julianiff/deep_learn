Abstract    :
                   Today, most community colleges are not offering a broadly  accepted
              portable associate degree in manufacturing.  This project  will develop
              instructional modules that can be infused into  existing curricula and,
              thereby, create the foundation for such a  degree.  Students will be brought to
              22 generic standards developed  by a national panel of educators and employers
              in 1994.  The  standards are based primarily on the competencies defined by the
               Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS).  
              Multidisciplinary teams of mathematics, science, and technology  faculty will
              design a series of CD-ROMs and print materials for 16  instructional modules
              and design a 17th work-based module.  The  materials will be produced by the
              Educational Film Center The  design teams will come from five Lead Colleges
              representing five  consortia of community colleges, which include over 130
              colleges.  The Lead Colleges will implement the revised curriculum and 
              disseminate the results to consortia members.  Two consortia are  state systems
              -- California and New Hampshire, two are  industry-based -- Boeing and the
              Alliance (of AT&T and its unions),  and the last is the Consortium for
              Manufacturing Competitiveness.   Affiliate Colleges will also implement the
              instructional modules  and, already, 25 colleges have been nominated or have
              indicated  that they want to participate.  National boards, which include 
              representatives of the American Association of Community Colleges,  the
              National Association of Manufacturers, the five consortia, IBM,  Ford, the
              Public Broadcasting System, and institutions at the  forefront of related
              efforts such as Sinclair Community College,  will guide the design and
              implementation activities and help  disseminate the results to community
              colleges and employers across  the nation.  A formative and summative
              evaluation will be  undertaken by the American Institutes for Research.  A
              successful  project will have a significant impact on technical education and 
              on the comp etitiveness of American manufacturing.
