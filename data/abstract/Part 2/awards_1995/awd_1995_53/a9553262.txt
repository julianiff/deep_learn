Abstract    :
              With funding from this Presidential Faculty Fellow award, Professor   Nowick
              will elaborate the factors affecting the structure and   interactions of
              biologically relevant molecules. For example, the aim of   this work is to
              develop new strategies for the delivery of biologically   active nucleic acid
              derivatives across cell membranes and to gain   fundamental insight into
              protein structure. This is accomplished by   modifying a micelle with a
              receptor molecule such as a nucleic acid   component thymine. Subsequent,
              introduction of a complimentary drug which   hydrogen bonds with the base
              provides a means for transporting a rather   polar compound across lipid
              bilayers or biological membranes. By   exploring inhibitors and a variety of
              other molecular probes it will be   possible to gather information on 3
              dimensional peptide structure and how   it effects molecular transport. In
              specific, this research addresses the   subject of protein folding which is a
              problem on many investigator's   palettes.  Understanding the principles by
              which physiologically active compounds   are bound and transported across cell
              membranes would provide scientists   with tools for making new drugs, making
              those presently known more   effective and creating new artificial systems
              which are medically   beneficial to mankind. This awardee and this project are
              destined to have   a major impact on this subject area and thereby is highly
              significant.
