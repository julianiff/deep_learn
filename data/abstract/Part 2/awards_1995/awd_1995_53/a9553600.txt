Abstract    :
              9553600  Lowery    The principal investigator proposes to develop, evaluate,
              publish, and disseminate nine minicourses to fulfill requirements for all three
              years of the middle school general science curriculum.  Each minicourse will
              take nine to twelve weeks to teach.  The new materials from the proposed
              project will combine with the K-6 materials of Full Option Science System
              (FOSS), developed previously with support from NSF, to produce a comprehensive
              set of materials for grades K-8.  The three year project will start on 1
              September 1996.  The curriculum development process includes the following
              steps: (1) exploration of ideas in classroom, (2) local trial of activities,
              and (3) national trials in 20 locations throughout the nation.  Each step of
              the process is followed by revision of the materials.  Minicourses will include
              the following resources for teacher use: (1) kit of laboratory materials for up
              to 32 students, (2) teacher guide, (3) optional measurement tools, (4) student
              resource book, (5) multimedia program, (6) assessment package, and (7) teacher
              preparation video.
