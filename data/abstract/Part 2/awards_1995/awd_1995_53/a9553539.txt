Abstract    :
              ***  9553539  Hamilton    Loyola University will initiate a 6-week, summer
              commuter, Young Scholars project with an extensive 8-month follow-up activities
              during the academic year for 18 students entering grades 11 and 12. The program
              is interdisciplinary, integrating computer science, physics and mathematics.
              the students are introduced to basic computer architecture, after which they
              assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers that are given to them to keep at the
              completion of the program. Other activities involve students performing labs in
              digital electronics, engineering and computer architecture, under the direction
              of a research physicist. The students also perform experiments on mathematical
              objects using computer programs they write in Pascal. Field trips are an
              integral part of the project. Career-oriented field trips will be made to R&D
              and production facilities such as AT&T Bell laboratories, Motorola, Rockwell
              International, and General Motors.  ***
