Abstract    :
              9553580  Apostol    The award winning, computer animated, broadcast quality
              videotapes on a number of  mathematics topics developed at California Institute
              of Technology under two previous NSF grants are the basis of this project that
              produces interactive multimedia lessons distributed on CD-ROM.   The videotapes
              use live action footage to relate mathematics to the real world and the
              interactive, multimedia version moves these materials more firmly into the
              hands of students.
