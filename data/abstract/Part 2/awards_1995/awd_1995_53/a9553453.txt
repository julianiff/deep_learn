Abstract    :
              GER-9553453  Ward  The Globalization and  Democratization training program is  a
              new interdisciplinary graduate  training and research effort which  focuses on
              how transformations of  the global economy affect the  practices and prospects
              of  democracy in different societies.  This program builds upon our  individual
              and collective teaching  and research interests, and the  strengths of the
              Research Program  in Political and Economic Change in  the Institute of
              Behavioral Science  at the University of Colorado. It  will forge a strong
              program of  training and research aimed at  producing a top-flight cohort of 
              interdisciplinary social science  scholars who will be trained in  behavioral
              science approaches that  emphasize both globalization and  democracy. These
              scholars will have  training in individual disciplines  as well as training
              that transcends  contemporary departmental  structures; they will be integrated
               into ongoing interdisciplinary  research projects on a variety of  level of
              social organization,  ranging from the workplace to the  international system;
              some will  work actively on developing new and  innovative curricular spin-offs
              on  the topics of globalization and  democracy at the graduate and 
              undergraduate levels; and some will  also be involved in international 
              exchanges.  A separate research proposal on the  manner in which democratic
              norms  and practices have spread since  1815 is appended to this training 
              grant proposal.
