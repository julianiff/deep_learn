Abstract    :
              9553157  Selen       This Presidential Faculty Fellow award supports  research
              on the properties of B-meson decays observed in the  CLEO detector at the
              Cornell University colliding beams  facility CESR.  The PI will continue a
              program of detector  research and development to improve particle
              identification  techniques.  He will maintain and expand a community-  outreach
              educational effort in the local area and develop  materials for a freshman
              level introductory mechanics course  at the University of Illinois.  ***
