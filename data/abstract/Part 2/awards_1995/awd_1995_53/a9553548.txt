Abstract    :
              9553548  Mark Wilson    This project will build on former work (creating SEPUP
              materials and assessments) and conduct research on the implementation of the
              embedded assessment component.  Questions to be answered in the project are:
              (1) How can technology assist teachers with assessment implementation?  (2) How
              can teachers use the full assessment system with maximum efficiency?  (3) What
              are the most effective means of providing professional development  in using
              and adapting the SEPUP assessment system?  (4) What is the impact of the
              assessment system on teachers' professional development?      The project will
              develop:  (1) materials for teacher discussion; (2) adapt computer and other
              technologies for use in classrooms; (3) design teacher support and professional
              development strategies; and (4) field test and evaluate the first three.
