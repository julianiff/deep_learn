Abstract    :
              ***  9553538  Morrell    Atlanta Metropolitan College will initiate a
              5-week,summer commuter, Young Scholars project in chemistry and mathematics for
              36 rising students entering grades 7 and 8.  The goal of Project SMART is to
              spark the sense of wonder, intrigue, and challenge concerning mathematics and
              the sciences in students who have been identified as having potential in these
              areas.  This goal will be accompllished through classroom  lectures and
              discussion, laboratory and field experiences stemming from an investigation
              into the chemistry of the environment and an investigation into the mathematics
              arising from these experiences.  Students will also investigate the concepts
              involved in mathematical modeling.  ***
