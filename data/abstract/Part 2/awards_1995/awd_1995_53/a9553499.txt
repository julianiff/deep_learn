Abstract    :
              9553499  Fleischman      Villanova University will initiate a six-week, summer
              residential, Young Scholars project with MSTP in biology and mathematics for 8
              teachers and 40 students entering grades 11 and 12. The summer component
              combines course work with extensive laboratory research experience. The subject
              matter in the two disciplines is presented in an innovative, unified manner
              that emphasizes interdisciplinary connections, scientific inference,
              quantitative thinking, and techniques of visualization. Other activities
              include field trips and panel discussions. Academic year follow-up activities
              include the implementation of individual research projects designed by the
              students during the summer.
