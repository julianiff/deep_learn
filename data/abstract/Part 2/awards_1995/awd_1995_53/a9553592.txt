Abstract    :
                9553592  Vesel    The principal investigator proposes to design, field test,
              evaluate, publish, and market new material to extend the scope of the seven
              units in the NGS Kids Network series for Elementary Grades.  Kids Network is a
              telecommunications-based science curriculum that allows students in grades 4
              through 6 to learn science content and process as they conduct hands-on
              investigations and share data and ideas with students on a computer network. 
              The new product will supplement each of the extant units with new material that
              will include: (1) open-ended, student-centered activities, (2) activities for
              using the Kids Network software and other available, recently developed
              technology, (3) diskettes with text files to be read or printed with the Kids
              Network software, (4) open-ended activities that extend the program into
              mathematics, language arts, and social studies, (5) flowcharts and tables to
              help teachers plan and to see how a unit supports the national standards, and
              (6) authentic assessments.  The project will be a collaborative effort of three
              partners: TERC, The National Geographic Society (NGS), and the NETWORK.  TERC
              will be responsible for the development of the supplemental material, The
              NETWORK will be responsible for the field testing and evaluation, and NGS will
              be responsible for publication, marketing, and dissemination.
