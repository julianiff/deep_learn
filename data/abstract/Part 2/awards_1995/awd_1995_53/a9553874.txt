Abstract    :
              9553874  Wallace    The Arizona Mineral Museum and the Flandrau Science Center
              at the  University of Arizona will use this planning grant to develop a new 
              interpretive exhibit "Minerals, Mining, and Mexico: A Cultural  Bridge to
              Science."  The University of Arizona Mineral Museum is  about to receive the
              Miguel Romero mineral collection which is one  of the most complete collections
              of Mexican minerals that exists.   It contains over 8500 specimens and this
              collection plus their  present collection will bring into being one of the
              finest regional  mineral collections available.  With it they will develop
              exhibits  and programming that explore minerals and mining of Mexico and the 
              southwestern U.S.  With this planning grant, they will explore the  exhibition
              and programming opportunities to realize their vision of  creating a "living
              and engaging museum that promotes an  understanding of basic science principles
              and an appreciation for  the beauty and economic importance of minerals in the
              context of  the historical and cultural perspective of the New World."  The 
              planning activities will include meetings of the advisory  committee, visits to
              other museums, and development of two  prototype exhibits.  At the end of the
              twelve-month planning period  they will have an overall script for the exhibit
              and  recommendations for individual exhibit units, a traveling exhibit 
              version, and curriculum materials for use by formal educators.
