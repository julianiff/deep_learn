Abstract    :
              9553330  Bartlett    This proposal is to build a global patchwork of students to
              be  involved in compiling data for use in monitoring global land cover  and use
              patterns in "Earth Day: Forest Watch".  This activity is  part of the GLOBE
              (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the  Environment) Program, a
              developing international program, housed in  an office in the White House. 
              Goals of GLOBE are to link  scientists and school children in a global
              information network,  with the shared goal of better understanding the Earth's 
              environment and changes that take place within.  The New Hampshire  team will
              develop teacher enhancement materials, provide training  to teachers and other
              instructors, and develop data integration and  program assessment materials
              following the initial April, 1995  sampling activities.  Data collected by
              students and evaluated by  scientists will be part of a study of the health of
              the white pine  trees, a known bioindicator for tropospheric ozone damage. 
              This  data will be linked to the international effort of the GLOBE  Program.
