Abstract    :
              9553857  Heard    The Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education plans
              a three year project designed to develop a set of 16, 18-minute motivational
              videotapes titled, The Eddie Files.  The Eddie Files is designed to be
              integrated into the elementary mathematics curriculum by providing teachers
              with resources that will engage, motivate and involve their students.  Each
              episode is accompanied by a teacher's guide, student activities, a related
              teacher enhancement video, and a set of Math at Home activities.   On-line
              activities serve the dual purposes of facilitating interaction among teachers
              and students, as well as, providing an additional distribution avenue for new
              lesson plans.    Major national educational improvement efforts, including the
              Systemic Initiatives and the National Standards movement, place a high priority
              on making mathematics accessible to all.  As a result of this project, upper 
              elementary teachers will have exemplary models of how to increase their
              students'  interest in mathematics and their students' knowledge of careers, by
              engaging their students in meaningful, complex, and mathematically rich
              problems  as found in The Eddie Files video tapes and accompanying ancillary
              materials.     The Eddie Files is designed to be integrated into the elementary
              mathematics curriculum for children aged 8-11.  The Eddie Files is presented
              from the viewpoint of a lively sixth grader.  Eddie's character is established
              through voice-over narration and  point of view camera shots.  We never see
              him, only hear his voice. In the videotaped series, Eddie and his classmates
              discover real-world uses of the mathematics they are studying in the classroom
              of East Harlem teacher, Kay Toliver.  In each of the sixteen video tapes, Ms.
              Toliver presents a lesson to real students and presents a workplace visit.  
              Eddie's mathematics assignments take him into the world beyond the classroom,
              where he meets a variety of professionals whose varied and challenging careers
              involve mathematics and s cience.
