Abstract    :
              9553905  Nye    This is a five year Local Systemic Change project to improve
              science education for all 1715 K-5 teachers in 84 elementary schools in Metro
              Nashville Public Schools District. This will be accomplished by providing
              intensive summer institutes and continuing school year collaborative sessions. 
              The District and Tennessee State University (TCU) will collaborate to initiate
              and sustain the reform through a partnership by creating site-based and
              cross-district learning communities with an enduring infrastructure to sustain
              the reform.  Leadership development will be a component of the project. There
              will be 11 Teachers in Residence to assume the role of professional development
              for a cluster of schools (each cluster will serve seven or eight elementary
              schools) and there will be teams of three school facilitators at each school. 
              The Teachers in Residence will provide professional development opportunities
              for teachers in  their  cluster of schools and the facilitators will be
              available on a day to day basis for the teachers in their respective schools.  
               Principals play an important role in the project.  Each will receive 50 hours
              of professional training which will be provided by the Co-Principal
              Investigators.  The intent is that the principals will become the instructional
              leaders of their schools.    The curriculum will be modular based and includes
              Science and Technology for Children (STC), INSIGHTS and FOSS units. All the
              science disciplines are included in the curriculum.  A Materials Resource
              Center has developed TSU and will be the distribution center for the kits. The
              Center maintains, refurbishes, and distributes the kits to the classrooms.   
              Scientists will work with teachers to develop skills in inquiry and to provide
              support and enhancement of the content for the curriculum.    The project
              requested $5,145,000 from NSF with institutions/agencies and  the Metro School
              District providing $14,011,353 in cost sharing.
