Abstract    :
                9553845  Irwin I. Shapiro    The principal investigator proposes to complete
              the development of an astronomy-based physical science curriculum (Project
              ARIES) for elementary-school students in grades three to six.  This three-year
              project, which begins 1 March 1996, is a follow-up to a previous NSF grant that
              is producing three modules on (1) Time, (2) Light and Color, and (3) Astronomy
              I.  The new project will produce five additional modules on (1) Astronomy II,
              (2) Waves, (3) Navigation, (4) Forces and Motion, and (5) Energy and the Sun. 
              Central features of the proposed materials are the use of innovative, simple,
              and affordable apparatus to carry out hands-on activities and basing science
              lessons on everyday experiences and observations shared by all students.  The
              specific educational objectives are to:  encourage students to learn and master
              a limited number of powerful scientific concepts;  communicate to students the
              excitement and challenge of science;  establish an environment where students
              are driven by their own curiosity;  empower students with the reasoning skills
              which can help them take an organized and logical approach to acquiring new
              information.
