Abstract    :
              GER-9553454  Gittell  We propose a graduate research  training program in the
              area of  Human Capital in Urban Communities  which will take an 
              interdisciplinary approach, and  draw upon faculty in political  science,
              sociology, environmental  psychology, social/personality  psychology, urban
              studies and  cultural anthropology already  conducting Human Capital related 
              research. The program is oriented  toward African-American and  Hispanic
              doctoral students, and  will involve an initial cohort of  five trainees. Our
              doctoral  programs have successfully  recruited and graduated substantial 
              numbers of minority doctoral  students in the social sciences for  two decades.
              We will use existing  recruitment bridges to outstanding  minority students in
              the senior  colleges of the City University of  New York, as well as national 
              searches. Seven of the training  program faculty will be minority  scholars.
              The program involves a  sequence of courses on research  methodologies,
              theoretical  approaches to understanding human  capital, and institutional
              studies  on families, neighborhoods,  schools, work places and labor  markets.
              It includes student  apprenticeships in existing faculty  research projects.
