Abstract    :
              9553348  Dimmock  The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), Auburn
              University  (AU), The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and Alabama 
              A&M University (AAMU) have teamed to create the Alabama Consortium  for Optical
              Technology (ALCOT) to develop optoelectronic materials  and devices critical to
              imaging,display, and energy conversion  technologies. The consortium's
              objectives are to significantly  improve Alabama's research and educational
              infrastructure and  develop optoelectronic enabling technologies for
              application in  commercially important devices.    By combining the resources
              of the consortium, we will be able to  significantly enhance the development of
              optoelectronic materials  and devices in the state of Alabama.    Research to
              be performed by the consortium will address a number  of key optoelectronic
              technologies toward the development of  demonstration devices. These include:  
                     (1)  Two- and three- dimensional liquid crystal flat panel         
              displays on the surface of VLSI chips for ultra-high          resolution
              projection systems, high definition television,          head-mounted displays,
              medical imaging, and virtual reality          systems.          (2)  High
              resolution, broad spectrum optical 3-D imaging          for safe, noninvasive
              interferometric measurement of                biological tissues. This has
              application to skin cancer             detection, detection and
              characterization of coronary               artery disease, endoscopic optical
              biopsies, periodontal          diagnosis of the level of bone attachment to
              dental                implants, and as a safe alternative to radiographic      
                        mammography.          (3)  Optoelectronic materials development,
              patterning, and           characterization directed toward the development of  
                            enhanced photovoltaic devices to power earth- and                
               space-based systems.          (4)  Development of novel heterostructure
              photodiodes and          broadband photodetectors b ased on quantum size
              effects.    The combined multilayered optical device fabrication capabilities 
              at UAH and AU, the ion beam tailoring capability of AAMU, and the  diagnostic
              and modeling capabilities at UAB will be used to sup-  port these efforts.
