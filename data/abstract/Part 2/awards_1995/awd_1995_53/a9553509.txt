Abstract    :
              9553509  Rosenstein    Rutgers University will initiate a four week residential,
              Young Scholars project in discrete mathematics for forty-five students entering
              grades 10-12.  The program will introduce students to discrete mathematics, an
              accessible field with many applications and many open problems; will increase
              students' problem solving ability; will expose them to a wide variety of
              mathematical scientists as role models; and will encourage them to consider
              careers in mathematics and the sciences.  Workshops conducted by college
              faculty will focus on applications of graphs, algorithms in graph theory,
              iteration and fractals, and applications.  A variety of technology environments
              will be used for explorations and demonstrations related to these topics. 
              Research projects will be mentored by university and industry mathematicians
              and computer scientists.  The program will include speakers from industry,
              field trips, career orientation workshops and discussions of ethics in the
              mathematical sciences. Follow up sessions will be held on four Saturdays during
              the school year.
