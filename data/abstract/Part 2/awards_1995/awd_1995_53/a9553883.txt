Abstract    :
              9553883  Stanley    Computer visualization and modeling techniques from current
              multidisciplinary research are used in simulation experiments to provide a
              basis for students to learn how microscopic processes such as intermolecular
              collisions determine macroscopic processes such as temperature, pressure, and
              the laws relating them. A modular set of materials is produced that allows
              students to discover a molecular-scale view of a wide range of materials from
              liquids to proteins and other polymers.  Special emphasis is placed on
              investigations of water.  Students compare the results of  computer simulations
              with closely integrated, hands-on laboratory activities and are challenged to
              think as research scientists do about scientific theory and modeling.  The
              simulations run on Pentium-based computers.  The materials include a CDROM
              containing complete teacher support material for installing and running
              computer programs, for performing hands-on activities, and for constructing
              experimental apparatus.  Materials are also available on the WWW which provides
              teacher support and exchange of ideas.  Experimental materials demonstrated
              that teachers changed their practice from lecturing to mentoring and concrete
              learners increased their understanding of the microscopic world.
