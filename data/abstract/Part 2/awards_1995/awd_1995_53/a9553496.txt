Abstract    :
              9553496  Adelani      Harris Stowe State College will initiate a five-week,
              summer commuter, Young Scholars project in physics and mathematics with
              applications to robotics for 32 high potential and high ability students
              entering grade 8. Students will be engaged in hands-on problem solving
              activities, classroom lectures and discussions, field trips and research
              involving applications of physics and mathematics. An extensive academic year
              follow-up component is planned for the middle school students designed to help
              them sustain their interest and commitment to seeking careers in science and
              mathematics.
