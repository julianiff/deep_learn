Abstract    :
              GER-9553409  Odom  An Industry Graduate Research  Traineeship Program (IGRT) is 
              described to increase the number  and quality of advanced degree  graduates in
              science and  engineering who are performing  research directly related to 
              industrial interests. The major  objectives of this program are to  foster
              increased linkages between  academic researchers and their  counterparts in
              industry, and to  introduce students to industrial  research and development
              (R&D) as a  viable career alternative. These  objectives will be accomplished
              by  requiring that the graduate  trainees perform at least 50% of  their
              dissertation research on-site  in an industrial R&D laboratory.  Research
              faculty who have developed  close ties to the private sector  will serve as
              directors of the  chosen trainees. The means by which  the trainees are
              recruited,  selected, maintained, and evaluated  are described. Support for
              five  trainees per year for each of five  years is requested from the NSF.  The
              project will be directed by  administrative personnel currently  serving on the
              South Carolina State  EPSCoR Committee.
