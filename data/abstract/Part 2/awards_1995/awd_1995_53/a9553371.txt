Abstract    :
              9553371  Fischer    The research methodology of our proposal rests on a tight 
              integration of theory, innovative system development, and  assessment. To
              achieve the focus on theory development, we will  focus the innovative system
              development on one project, namely the  Remote Exploratorium which combines
              design environments with  networking.    Our theory development will be
              supported through our strategic  alliances-alliances that we have developed
              over the last few years  ranging from K-12 schools (New Vista High School,
              Boulder),  universities (Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory, CU 
              Boulder), and corporations (NYNEX Science and Technology; and Apple  Computer).
              In the context of these alliances we will study  specifically.         *   
              teachers as lifelong learners, and        *    the integration of learning into
              working rather than            regarding learning as a separate activity.    We
              will develop a conceptual framework founded on the objective  that learners of
              all ages should be engaged in authentic, self-  directed learning supported by
              innovative technologies. This  framework, as it develops, needs to be radically
              different from  most other approaches of using computers.  ***
