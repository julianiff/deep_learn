Abstract    :
              The CESME Demonstration Project will demonstrate a portion of our  original
              Hawaii Collaborative for Excellence in Science and  Mathematics (CESME)
              proposal submitted in June 1995 to the NSF CETP  program.  We propose to
              develop, test, and evaluate a small-scale  model for effective collaborative
              reform of science and mathematics  preparation for pre-service elementary
              teachers in the University  of Hawaii system.  The Project brings together
              scientists and  mathematicians from the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and
               Kapiolani Community College (also within the University of Hawaii  system),
              science and mathematics educators from the College of  Education at UHM, and
              specialists and inservice teachers from the  Hawaii Department of Education. 
              The Project aims to restructure  four existing courses to reflect reforms in
              science and mathematics  content, teaching, and assessment standards; to better
              integrate  science and mathematics in these courses; and to better articulate 
              these content and education courses.  Hawaii has both a statewide  higher and a
              lower public education system that makes the proposed  Project collaborations
              possible.
