Abstract    :
              9553567  Bond    Through this project, the National Board for Professional
              Teaching  Standards (NBTPS) will conduct the necessary research and 
              development to build a Science Certificate for teachers of students  ages 14
              through 18+.  The components of the assessment will be a  teacher portfolio and
              activities undertaken at an assessment center  which focuses on issues science
              teachers regularly encounter.    During the project, systematic pilot tests
              will be conducted,  scoring rubrics developed, and procedures invented for 
              administration of the assessment center exercises along with the  training of
              examiners.  The project will advance the state-of-the-  art in teacher
              performance assessment, and results will inform  policymakers, teachers,
              administrators and scholars interested in  teacher preparation and continuing
              professional development.
