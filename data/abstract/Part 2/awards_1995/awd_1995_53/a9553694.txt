                            Title: Advancing Geo-technology Education:  Providing GIS  Remote
               Skills for the Workforce of the Twenty-First Century           The Department
              of Geography and Geology of Indiana State  University, is introducing
              twenty-five community college  instructors to the principles of Geographic
              Information Systems  (GIS), one of the fastest growing employment fields in the
              19990s.   Designed to promote the adoption of GIS as an integral part of 
              numerous technically-oriented instructional programs in two-year  colleges,
              this model program is taking the needed first step in  supplying the workforce
              in the Midwest with technicians educated in  the use of this rapidly growing
              technology.  Working in teams of  two or three community college instructors
              from the same  institution, participants are acquiring the basic principles of
              GIS  in two 3-week summer institutes and in one continuing education  class. 
              They are learning of the many ways in which this technology  is used today in
              business, government, and industry.  The immediate  aim of this project is to
              give participants sufficient familiarity  with GIS principles and knowledge of
              software and its utility so  that they can return to their campuses with enough
              expertise to  begin to incorporate this technology into existing courses.  The 
              long-term aim envisions participants establishing discrete GIS-  education
              programs at their institutions. To ensure realization of  project goals,
              consultants from two-year colleges with successful  GIS programs are advising
              in organizing all instructional programs  and are part of the summer
              institutes' teaching teams.  A two-year  college faculty member is serving as
              project evaluator.    Close cooperation of the Robinson, Illinois campus of
              Illinois  Eastern Illinois Co mmunity Colleges and the Terre Haute campus of 
              Indiana Vocational Technical Institute is assured with the  inclusion of
              faculty teams from those two institutions receiving  GIS instruction in the
              summer institutes and by providing them with  hardware and software to help
              facilitate employment of GIS into  their existing courses.  Development of
              introductory courses in GIS  and integration of GIS into existing courses at
              these two  institutions is a primary aim of the project.
