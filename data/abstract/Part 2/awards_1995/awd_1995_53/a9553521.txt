Abstract    :
              *  9553521  Reinhall      The University of Washington will initiate a
              four-week, summer commuter, Young Scholars project for 40 Seattle high
              potential and economically disadvantaged students in grades 7th and 8th. The
              project provides students with an opportunity to engage in classroom,
              laboratory, field trips, and research activities with university faculty during
              the summer. The project terminates during the academic year with the design and
              construction of a complex engineering system involving a robot.  ***
