Abstract    :
              A core group of mathematics and science content and education  faculty from the
              University of Delaware, Delaware State University,  and Delaware Technical
              Community College are collaborating with K-  12 teachers in an initial effort
              to reform ten existing courses  that make up parts of the pre-service teacher
              preparation programs  at these three institutions. Work is also planned on
              three new  courses for in-service teachers. In this project K-12 teachers will 
              work with higher education faculty, leading to the development of  a K-16
              community of mathematics and science educators, dedicated to  the continual
              improvement of its pre-service teacher preparation  programs. These reform
              efforts also leverage the considerable  momentum towards reform engendered by
              the Delaware State Systemic  Initiative project.
