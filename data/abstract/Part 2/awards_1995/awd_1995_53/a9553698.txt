Abstract    :
                   Regional Technology Strategies, Inc. proposes to design,  support and
              implement, in partnership with the American Association  of Community Colleges,
              National Association of Manufacturers, and  the Southern Growth Policies Board,
              two major symposia, one in the  South and the other in the Northeast that will
              focus on how  two-year educational institutions can better meet the technical 
              skill needs of modern, high value, high performance manufacturers.   The
              proposed symposia are intended to inform education and training  policy makers
              about changes and opportunities in technical  occupations in advanced
              manufacturing, to deepen their  understanding of the emerging industrial
              modernization system, to  identify obstacles and opportunities to improve
              performance, and to  develop a clear vision of how to make those improvements. 
              Those  invited will include presidents of member colleges, chancellors of 
              state systems, and directors of state modernization programs,  school-to-work
              transition programs, and economic development  agencies.  Each chancellor will
              be asked to submit names of others,  e.g., presidents, legislators, board
              members, to be invited from  their respective states.       The host
              organizations in the South will be the Consortium for  Manufacturing
              Competitiveness, a group of leading technical  colleges started and incubated
              by the Governors and legislators of  the southern states under the Southern
              Growth Policies Board and,  in the Northeast, a new alliance of college
              systems.  The objective  of each is to accelerate and support industrial
              modernization with  improved technical education and services that build demand
              for and  help small and medium sized manufacturers better utilize technical 
              skills
