Abstract    :
              9553140  O'Shea  Yeast growth is sustained by the availability of nutrients. 
              Phosphate is a required nutrient.  When phosphate is limiting transcription of
              an acid phosphatase occurs.  This enzyme which is secreted hydrolyzes
              phosphoryl groups of organic molecules to yield phosphate ion.  The PHO5 gene
              encodes the phosphatase; transcription is tightly repressed when yeast are
              grown in medium containing Pi.  Three positive regulators and two negative
              regulators of the gene have been identified.  Two of the positive regulators
              have been shown to be transcriptional regulators that bind to the promoter. 
              Both of the negative regulators are essential; deletion of either results in
              high levels of gene expression.   One of these, PHO80, is homologous to a yeast
              cyclin (which regulates cell division).  The other negative regulator, PHO85,
              is a CDC related protein kinase.  The complex of negative regulators
              phosphorylates transcription factor PHO4 only when yeast are grown in high
              phosphate.  This phosphorylation is correlated with gene repression.  Growth in
              low Pi results in one of the positive regulators, PHO81, inhibiting the kinase
              complex.  The reduced activity of the kinase is correlated with derepression of
              the gene; this is assisted by the action of PHO4 whose biochemical activity is
              not characterized.  %%%  Yeast require phosphate to grow and multiply.  When
              phosphate amounts are low the yeast secrete a special enzyme that breaks down
              organic compounds that contain phosphate to renew the supplies.  The
              investigator has found that the same molecules that regulate the production of
              the special enzyme also regulate cell division.  This is a remarkable example
              of  adaptation to the environment.  The use of the same or similar molecules
              that control phosphate use which is necessary for growth and division also
              direct the cell to reproduce itself.  ***
