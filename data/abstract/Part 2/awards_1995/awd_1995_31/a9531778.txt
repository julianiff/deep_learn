Abstract    :
              This project will use magnetogram and filtergram sequences to derive flow maps
              and time histories of displacements of concentrations of magnetic flux.  In
              addition, the PIs will study the dispersal of flux over the solar surface on
              scales of several supergranules and below, particularly the reaction of flows
              to the presence of fields.  The central goal is finding an appropriate model to
              describe the transport phenomena associated with photospheric magnetic flux. 
              Specifically, the PIs hope to gain understanding of the differences in the
              diffusion coefficients, to the deviations from classical random walk, and to
              the dependence of the flow pattern on the local mean magnetic flux density. 
              The project will combine high-resolution data to allow a detailed study of
              subarcsecond topology and flux dynamics with uninterrupted long-duration
              sequences with large fields of view, allowing a statistical study of flux
              displacement histories.  The program will provide a means for systematic  and
              coherent analysis, specifically focusing on magnetoconvection.***
