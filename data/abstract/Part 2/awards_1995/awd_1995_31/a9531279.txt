Abstract    :
              9531279  Pirmez  This project by researchers at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
              of Columbia University in New York will develop a high-resolution gamma-ray
              logging tool for use in ocean drilling, and specifically for studies carried
              out onboard JOIDES Resolution, the deep-sea drilling vessel operated on behalf
              of the international partnership of the Ocean Drilling Program, of which NSF is
              the lead partner.  This development of improved resolution of loggilg provides
              a key element for improving fine-scale correlation between recovered cores and
              precise depth in section, and is of special importance to detailed studies of
              climate and ocean history.  It is anticipated that the new design will improve
              resolution by at least a factor of 2-3 over present technology, allowing
              recognition of climatically-induced cycles in the borehole in many regions
              where this is not presently possible.  The combined development of a
              "universal" downhole telemetry system will make the system compatible with the
              existing shipboard logging system on JOIDES Resolution, and the telemetry
              system will be compatible with other systems, expanding the capability of
              JOIDES Resolution to run multiple-tool logging experiments.  ***
