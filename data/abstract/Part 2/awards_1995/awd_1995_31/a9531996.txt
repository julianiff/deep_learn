Abstract    :
              9531996  TOWNSEND    An  X-ray mapping, analytical microprobe technique will be 
              tested to  measure  Sr/Ca ratios in the otoliths of larval  cod  fishes.
              Success  with  this  procedure will  identify  the  relationships between
              successive daily growth  increments,vertical distribution/diel migration
              patterns,  and hydrographic  structure in  the  water  column.  Specimens
              collected  from  Georges  Bank during the spring  and early summer period when
              thermal stratification  develops  will provide  information  that  should
              broaden  an  understanding  of  larval  transport,  survival  and  recruitment.
