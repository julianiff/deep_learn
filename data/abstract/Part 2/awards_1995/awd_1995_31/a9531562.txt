Abstract    :
                Abstract    9531562  May    The GT-SUPREEM is an eight week summer REU Site
              program designed to attract qualified minority students into electrical
              engineering.  Ten students will be recruited annually on a nationwide basis and
              paired with faculty and a graduate student mentor to undertake research
              projects in electrical engineering.  Examples of research projects include: 
              1.) Theoretical studies of electronic state in finite quantum wells and
              superlattices, 2.) Four-wave mixing: cross talk behavior in optical fiber, 3.)
              Focal plane image processing and signal amplification, 4.) Implementation of
              context cache for pica architecture, and 5.) A quadrature oscillator using
              sliding modes.
