Abstract    :
              This award provides support to the University of Memphis for an REU Site which
              offers students research experiences in sociology.  Twelve students each year,
              over a three year period, will be selected for eight week sessions in the
              summer.  The thematic research experience examines the issue of
              underrepresentation of women and African Americans in physical sciences and
              engineering majors and science careers.  Using both quantitative and
              qualitative methods, teams of students will approach the issue from three
              angles:  (1) the process by which students commit to science majors, the
              factors in performance and persistence, and the process by which students
              commit to graduate study and careers in science; (2) the impact of a pilot
              curriculum transformation in the introductory physics course for science and
              engineering students on performance,  persistence, and plans of women and
              African American students; and (3) science faculty attitudes toward science
              students and the teaching of science.  The students will have access to
              research data generated by at least three ongoing research and intervention
              projects funded by NSF and NIH.  Activities of the Site will include
              orientation seminars, research seminars, and graduate education/career planning
              seminars.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
              attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
              research experiences.
