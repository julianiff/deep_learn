Abstract    :
              9531997  Chang  The Great Hanshin earthquake which struck Kobe, Japan on January
               17, 1995 killed over 5,000 residents and caused over $100 billion  in losses. 
              The magnitude of this disaster exceeds any experience  in the modern history of
              the U.S. and represents an opportunity  to learn lessons relevant to the
              earthquake threat to this  country.  This project will investigate selected
              aspects of  economic impact in the Hanshin earthquake in order to develop a 
              methodological framework for estimating the economic impact of a  catastrophic
              urban earthquake in the U.S.  The investigation will  also involve comparisons
              with the moderate Northridge and Loma  Prieta disasters, accounting for
              relevant differences between the  U.S. and Japan.  The project will build on
              on-going research  being carried out by the investigators on the Hanshin
              earthquake.  The project focuses on two issues which may  be especially 
              important in extrapolating economic impact from moderate to major  urban
              disasters:  nonlinear effects and structural change in the  economy.  ***
