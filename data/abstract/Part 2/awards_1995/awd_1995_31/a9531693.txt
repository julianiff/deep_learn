Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Raftery will develop a magnetic resonance technique   to
              enhance surface signals in catalyst materials.  The technique, called   Optical
              Pumping Enhancement for NQR of Surfaces (OPENS), overcomes the   usual
              limitations of sensitivity by combining optical pumping with   nuclear
              quadrupole resonance (NQR) detection in zero magnetic field.    Surface signal
              enhancements of five orders of magnitude are expected   compared with normal
              NQR detection.  Polarization transfer from xenon   atoms to surface quadrupolar
              nuclei will be employed.  Detection limits   will be investigated using an
              isotopic nitrogen-14 compound.    Selective oxidative catalysts are used in
              many chemical production   processes world wide, translating into billions of
              dollars of commerce   annually.  Industrial applications of catalytic materials
              range from new   routes for the synthesis of important materials to elimination
              of harmful   waste by-products.  In these studies the structure of catalytic
              materials   will be studied using a new magnetic resonance technique in order
              to   learn how they function and to be able eventually to improve their  
              manufacture and use.  Initial materials examined will be those from   catalytic
              systems of practical importance, copper oxide and titanium   dioxide.
