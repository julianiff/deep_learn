Abstract    :
              9531373  Gallian   This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate
              researchers in   mathematics working under the supervision of a faculty
              advisor. The area of research is   discrete mathematics. The program will run
              for ten weeks. Students each give a   presentation of their work during the
              summer. At the end of the program, the students will   prepare their work for
              possible publication.
