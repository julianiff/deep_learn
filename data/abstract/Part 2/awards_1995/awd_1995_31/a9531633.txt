Abstract    :
              9531633  Findley       This award provides funding to purchase shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The  instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V SEWARD JOHNSON,  a  176 foot vessel, which is owned by
              Harbor Branch  Oceanographic Institution (HBOI).  Under the terms of a 
              coopeartive agreement, HBOI operates the R/V, and RSMAS  provides technical
              support for research cruises.  Instrumentation funded includes some network
              upgrades for  the ship, a CTD and water sampler, slip rings, a transducer 
              array, and data acquisition hardware.  The instrumentation  requested is for
              support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the  R/V SEWARD JOHNSON during 1996 and
              will enhance the  scientific capability of the vessel in the future.  ***
