Abstract    :
              9531396  Jacobsmeyer   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              investigates a channel hopping mobile data base station for use on cellular
              radio networks. Because voice cellular radio systems must maintain low blocking
              probabilities, more than 20% of cellular channel capacity is unused, even
              during the busy hour. A packet radio system can capture this unused capacity by
              hopping between idle voice channels, working independently of the voice base
              station and the cellular telephone switch. To optimize performance, the mobile
              data base station should select the idle channel with the least co-channel
              interference. By doing so, the base station will maximize the
              carrier-to-interference ratio at the mobile terminal and maximize throughput
              when automatic repeat-request protocols are used. For example, if the offered
              voice traffic at an 18-channel sector is 9 Erlangs, the data base station can
              achieve a throughput improvement of 42% and a coverage area increase of 28%.
              This study extends the Phase I research by collecting interference data from an
              actual cellular radio system and testing new hopping algorithms against this
              data. The firm will also use the data to develop better models of the cellular
              voice multiple access system and co-channel interference. If successful, the
              project will result in a working prototype of a smart channel hopping radio
              receiver and controller that will substantially increase the throughput and
              geographical coverage of the Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) system.   The
              principal commercial applications of this research are wireless multiple access
              communication networks, including cellular radio, mobile satellite, and
              wireless local area networks. The primary benefit of the proposed research is
              more economical use of packet radio base stations, resulting in more affordable
              mobile data service for the U.S. consumer.
