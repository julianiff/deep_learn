Abstract    :
              A `Research Experiences for Undergraduates` Site will be  initiated at Oregon
              State University.  Through a national  recruitment process, 8 undergraduate
              students will be  selected to be involved in a 10-week summer research program 
              in physics.  Fields of physics to be emphasized include AMO,  computational,
              solid state, and nuclear.  Students will be  housed together in campus
              dormitories.  Each REU student  will work in a close mentoring relationship
              with one of the  faculty in their research labs.  In addition to the research 
              experience, the participants will complete a special short  summer course in
              interfacing computers to laboratory  devices, a skill that is essential in many
              research  programs, and they will also receive instruction in machine  shop
              techniques.  An informal `physics literary club` will  meet weekly and will
              feature discussion of works of  literature that have a significant physics
              content.  A final  `mini-conference` will give the students an opportunity to 
              describe their research to their colleagues and to the  faculty and students of
              the Physics Department.  The program  will be evaluated through written surveys
              as well as through  oral interviews.
