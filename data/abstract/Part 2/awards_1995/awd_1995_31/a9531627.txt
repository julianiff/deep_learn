Abstract    :
              9531627  Kalka   This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
              researchers in   mathematics. The site focuses on providing a research
              experience for upper level   undergraduates in geometry and topology within a
              seminar setting. Research projects in   the areas of scalar curvature,
              Reidemeister torsion in geometric topology, harmonic forms,   and complex
              dynamics are being offered within the context of an overall seminar program  
              involving the students in basic study of geometry and topology. The program
              will run for   eight weeks.
