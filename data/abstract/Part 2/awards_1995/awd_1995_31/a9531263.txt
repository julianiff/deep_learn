Abstract    :
              9531263  van Dam  Computer-human interfaces is an area of increasing importance
              throughout the sciences.  In recognition of this, MIT is planning to host a
              symposium on CHI issues, designed to be both a retrospective of the field, and
              a view toward the future of this field.  One aspect of this symposium will be a
              celebration of Vannevar Bush's landmark paper "As We May Think," which 50 years
              ago foresaw a whole sequence of modern developments, including modern computer
              interfaces, hypermedia, laser printers, networking, knowledge repositories, and
              so on.  It is interesting to ask what factors lead to the success of "far out"
              ideas like these, and the complete failure of others whih seemed equally
              plausible at the time.  The other aspect of this symposium is a focus on the
              future; where will today's technologies lead, what can be said about the future
              of CHI research?  A distinguished set of speakers from the computer science and
              engineering communities will offer their views on the future of CHI, and on the
              most fruitful directions for future research.
