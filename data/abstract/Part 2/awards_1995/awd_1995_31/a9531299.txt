Abstract    :
              INT 9531299  Bazant        This U.S.-Czech research project between Zdenek
              Bazant of Northwestern University and three researchers from Czech Technical
              University, Zdenek Bittnar, Milan Jirasek and Jan Vitek, will focus on
              inelastic hinges in frames of buildings and bridges that undergo progressive
              damage and exhibit softening resulting from dynamic or cyclic loading such as
              that caused by earthquake, blast or impact.  Such damage can remain distributed
              over many inelastic hinges or it can localize in only some of them.    Dr.
              Bazant and his Czech partners note that localization is a dangerous phenomenon
              because it can cause collapse to occur more rapidly.  This project will involve
              a systematic, theoretical and numerical study of the localization problem.  The
              progressive degradation and fracture of concrete in compression under lateral
              confinement simulating the effect of reinforcement will also be studied, with
              analysis of localization and fracture extended to the shear failure of beams. 
              Particular attention will be devoted to the size effect brought about by
              localization of softening and by fractures in tension, shear and compression. 
              Results are expected to help make predictions of concrete structures'
              resistance to dynamic and cyclic loading more realistic and subsequently
              contribute to safer designs.    This project in mechanics and materials
              engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.   ??
