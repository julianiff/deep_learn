Abstract    :
              The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) process technology has matured to
              the  point where it is possible to fabricate a chip with both electrical and 
              mechanical pomponents on it.   However, tools and design methodologies are 
              lacking.  This worksho is to bring together design researchers from the VLSI
              CAD  and MEMS design fields to discuss and develop ideas for a new design
              methodology  for combined MEMS/VLSI structures.
