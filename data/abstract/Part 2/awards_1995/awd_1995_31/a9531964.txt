Abstract    :
              9531964  Kronheimer     The proposed  research deals with geometry and gauge
              theory in dimensions three and four, with an emphasis on the study of the
              monopole equations recently introduced by Seiberg and Witten. These equations
              have been used to define new differential invariants of manifolds, and the
              investigator wishes to examine these invariants in isolation as well as in the
              presence of various geometric structures on the underlying manifold. In
              addition, the proposed research seeks to understand the internal structure of
              these invariants in relation to other closely related invariants such as
              Donaldson invariants.     The study of four dimensional curved spaces has
              received a boost in recent years due to ideas coming from theoretical physics.
              In the early eighties Donaldson came up with a set of differential invariants
              (these are used to distinguish and classify different four dimensional spaces)
              using ideas from particle physics; in 1994 Witten and Seiberg came up with
              another set of invariants which are considerably easier to calculate.
