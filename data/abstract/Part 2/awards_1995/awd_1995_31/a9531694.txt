Abstract    :
              9531694  Meerkov   This research concerns the application of rigorous
              mathematical analysis from systems theory to improve output rate of production
              lines by better allocation of resources.  It is an innovative approach to the
              "bottleneck " problem.  The researchers have developed a theory of
              improvability, where a production system is considered improvable  under
              constraints if limited resources such as work -in-process  or workforce can be
              redistributed so that a performance index (usually production rate) can be
              increased.  Here, improvement, rather than optimality, is looked for, since it
              is often impossible to determine optimality due to the extremely complex
              mathematical nature of production systems.  The research will also investigate
              unconstrained improvability, namely determining the machine, device, or
              assembly station that impedes the systems performance in the strongest manner,
              i.e., the bottleneck.   The approach of the research is based on sound
              mathematical principles which result in usable operating rules for the "shop"
              floor.  The researchers have excellent industry ties, and the theoretical
              results are constantly evaluated in real industrial environments.
