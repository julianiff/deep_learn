Abstract    :
              9531874    Spall    This project is a contribution to the modeling component to
              be  carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate  Experiment
              (ACCE) under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment  (WOCE).  The focus will be
              on upgrading existing isopycnal  models, data assimilation, and integrating
              different types of  regional models.  Comparisons will be made among different 
              modeling approaches in order to assess the strngths and  weaknesses of each,
              and to determine the best overall approach  for including ocean variability in
              climate modeling.  Particular  attention will be paid to assimilating, into the
              models, data  from the field phase of ACCE, as well as from historical data 
              bases.  In this particular project, the PI will focus on the  physics that
              control the time dependent spreading of intermediate  and deep waters away from
              their source regions in the subpolar  gyre, and the influences of these water
              masses on the basin-scale  upper ocean flow and Sea Surface Temperature. 
              Specific  influences include baroclinicity, bottom topography, isopycnal  and
              diapycnal mixing, eddy fluxes, and time dependence in  partitioning the waters
              into boundary current transports and  interior recirculation gyres.
