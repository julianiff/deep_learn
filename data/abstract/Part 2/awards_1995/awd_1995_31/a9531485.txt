Abstract    :
              9531385  Antsaklis                This is a request for block international
              travel funds for  the 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) to be
              held  in Kobe, Japan from December 11th to 13th, 1996.  The CDC is one  of the
              world's largest and most important conferences on control  theory and
              applications.  The Kobe location will be only the  third time the CDC has been
              held outside the United States.  The  requested funds will be instrumental in
              improving the technical  success of the conference by enabling participation of
              sufficient  numbers of key U.S. authors.  ***
