Abstract    :
              ***  9531282  Chenausky    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will fabricate and demonstrate a prototype air cooled, sealed-off,
              33-cm gain length carbon dioxide laser, having a 40-watt average output power
              and a peak output of 1 kilowatt.  To achieve this output, the laser will use an
              innovative excitation geometry that generates a rectangular cross section
              transverse RF discharge between a pair of narrow, low area, closely spaced
              ceramic side walls, that transfer heat by collisions from the discharge and
              guide the intra-cavity mode in the small transverse dimension.  The widely
              spaced, low capacitance electrode permits efficient RF discharge pumping with
              27 or 13 MHz excitation.  This moderates standing wave effects with
              longitudinal discharge uniformity but without the use of intra- or extra-vacuum
              inductive elements.  This unique excitation geometry forces the gas discharge
              into a shape that naturally suppresses the tendency of the discharge to
              transition into the undesirable gamma or high current mode of operation.   
              Potential commercial applications are expected in emerging medical-dental
              procedures using a simple, low intra-vacuum part count, low cost laser device
              approach.  ***
