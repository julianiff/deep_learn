Abstract    :
              9531998  Engel  This award is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) 
              project.  The objective is to investigate the resin transfer  molding of class,
              two dimensional fiber reinforced plastic grids  for use in reinforced concrete
              panels such as curtain walls and  bridge decks.    The investigation will focus
              on:  specifying the perform  architecture and grid pattern for the resin
              transfer mold  production of a two-dimensional fiber reinforced plastic grid
              and  test performance in panel under transverse loads.  ***
