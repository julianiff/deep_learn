Abstract    :
              The proposed project will address the effect of relaxed selection on the
              accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations and the corresponding impact of
              this accumulation on population fitness in the fruit fly, Drosophila
              melonagaster.  Sufficiently large populations of Drosophila melanogaster will
              be propagated for 30-40 generations using  the "Middle class neighborhood"
              approach to shut down selection.  For each generation all virgin flies will be
              randomly divided into pairs (female and male), each pair will be placed in a
              separate vial, the female will be allowed to lay only a few eggs, and a son and
              daughter will be chosen randomly from each vial to contribute to the next
              generation.  Using this technique, selection will be absent because each
              individual will contribute the same number of offspring (two) into the next
              generation.  The change in fitness-related traits (fecundity, mobility,
              longevity, and competitive ability) will be measured every 5 generations. 
              Natural selection is relaxed in captive animal and civilized human populations,
              and, consequently, there is no barrier to the accumulation of new slightly
              deleterious mutations. The relaxation of selection is hypothesized to lead to a
              gradual decay of population fitness.  Determining the rate of decay is
              important and will provide a basis for designing captive breeding programs in
              endangered species to reduce the effects of the accumulation of slightly
              deleterious muations.
