Abstract    :
                Abstract    9531691  Castaneda    The REU Site program at the University of
              Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) will be in structural engineering.  Six students
              will participate in this program annually.  The students will learn methods for
              conducting research and build relations with fellow REU peers as well as with
              faculty through organized activities.  Example research topics include:  1.)
              Nonlinear dynamic analyses on steel braced frame power generation facilities,
              2.) Damage occurring at newer bridge decks, 3.) Forensic investigation of
              collapsed structures due to earthquakes, 4.) Properties of concrete, and 5.)
              Instrumentation and remote monitoring of bridge structures.
