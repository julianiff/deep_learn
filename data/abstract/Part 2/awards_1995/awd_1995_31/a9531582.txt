Abstract    :
              9531582  Chiang  With this award, the Department of Physics at the University 
              of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will acquire a high  resolution photoelectron
              analyzer, which will be dedicated  to support research in materials and
              physical sciences.  The  equipment will be used for two research projects based
              on  high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy.  In one, the  atomic structure
              of surfaces will be studied using the  techniques of photoelectron diffraction,
              extended  photoemission fine structure spectroscopy, and photoelectron 
              holography.  These techniques provide information about the  symmetry and
              geometrical arrangement of surface atoms, and  are powerful tools for
              investigating the atomistics of  surface chemical reactions and film growth. 
              In the other  project, quantum layer structures, including single and  multiple
              quantum wells and superlattices, will be studies.  The goal is to understand
              the electronic effects associated  with quantum confinement, coupling,
              interface scattering and  crystal potential modulation.  Spin polarization and 
              magnetic effects in these quantum structures will be  investigated.  This
              analyzer will be used in conjunction  with the new undulator sources that are
              under construction  at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (Stoughton, Wisconsin) 
              and the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National  Laboratory).
