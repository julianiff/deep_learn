Abstract    :
              DeBarber  9531391   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              builds on the successful results of the Phase I research that demonstrated an
              optical diagnostic technique capable of real-time measurement of species
              concentration in complex, multi-phase, spray combustion environments. A
              significant accomplishment of the Phase I work was to integrate photorefractive
              crystals with the technique of Resonant Holographic Interferometry (RHI) to
              record and reconstruct species specific holographic interferograms of
              combusting sprays at video data rates. In this Phase II effort, research will
              conducted to develop a compact, cost effective instrument that permits high
              speed acquisition and automated reduction of RHI interferograms. The milestones
              of the research are to develop and implement an automated data reduction method
              with photorefractive crystals, integrate compact tunable laser diodes, and
              design and build a fiber optic based prototype system. The Phase II research
              will culminate with a demonstration of the prototype system in a practical
              combustion environment to gain its acceptance into the scientific community and
              generate commercial interest that will lead into Phase III commercialization.  
              This diagnostic instrument will lead to the improved development of a wide
              variety of combustion and spray devices such as fuel injectors, spray
              atomizers, and high pressure nozzles. Markets for this technology include
              automotive engineering, aircraft engine development, hazardous waste
              incineration, combustion research, and spray coatings.
