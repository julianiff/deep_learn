Abstract    :
              This grant supports investigations of nuclear structure and  electromagnetic
              moments by two Rutgers University faculty  members who will carry out their
              experiments at Argonne  National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Yale
               University, and elsewhere.  They will study excitations at  high spin and
              excitation energy in heavy nuclei far from  stability.  The electromagnetic
              moments of both light and  heavy nuclei will be measured to determine the
              effect of the  neutron-proton interaction near the regions for which N/Z is 
              near the edges of nuclear stability.
