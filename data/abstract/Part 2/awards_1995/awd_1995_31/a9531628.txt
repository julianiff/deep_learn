Abstract    :
              ***  9531628  Thompson  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site 
              program at the University of Pittsburgh will be continued.  This is a renewal,
              with minor modifications, of the program  at the University of Pittsburgh for
              the past 4 years.  Besides their research activities, the participants will 
              also participate in academic studies in support of the  research work, and will
              help to serve as mentors and role  models for high school or less advanced
              college students.  The program emphasizes African-American participation, both 
              from within and outside the host institution, but all  interested students are
              invited to apply.  Students may  participate as early as the summer before
              their sophomore  year in college.  The program is for summer participation  (10
              weeks) with participation in consecutive summers  strongly encouraged.  Some
              students may continue their  research during the school year.  ***
