Abstract    :
              9531255  Trnovsky   During the last two decades, manipulation of DNA for the
              production of recombinant proteins has become a cornerstone of the
              biotechnology industry, and the recombinant proteins are now widely used as
              research reagents as well as therapeutics.  Transfected cell line development
              however, can take as long as six months and can cost in excess of $100,000,000.
               In the emerging field of cellular therapeutics, patient cells are isolated,
              transfected, and expanded ex vivo, or outside the body, and then reinfused or
              encapsulated in implantable devices.  Since the quality of the cell population
              is critical to therapeutic outcome, new separation approaches have become vital
              to treatment success.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              from One Cell Systems outlines research to develop a rapid, high throughput
              method for screening transfected cells based on recombinant protein secretion. 
              Using gel microdrop single cell encapsulation technology, a unique capture
              assay format, and fluorescence activated cell sorting; protein secretion of
              individual cells can be measured and high producer cells isolated and recovered
              for gene therapy or bioprocessing applications.  As additional biotechnology
              based products move toward commercialization, methods which improve the
              efficiency of cell selection and enhance bioprocessing yields will increase in
              importance.  This novel, platform technology is adaptable to several clinical
              diagnostic, drug discovery, and therapeutic applications.   Production of
              recombinant proteins using transfected cell lines is a multibillion dollar
              industry currently dominated by US biopharmaceutical companies.  Existing
              methods for selecting and expanding transfected cells are time consuming and
              highly variable.  Successful completion of this research will result in
              improved cell screening for bioprocessing, drug discovery, and gene therapy
              applications.
