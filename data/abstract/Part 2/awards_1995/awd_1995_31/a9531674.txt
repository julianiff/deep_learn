Abstract    :
              9531674  Tull                                  This project will construct a
              high resolution spectrograph  (30,000 < R < 120,000) for the 9-meter Hobby
              Eberly  Telescope.  The spectrograph will operate in the visible  region of the
              spectrum and is adapted from a successful  design used in the
              Ultraviolet-Visible Echelle Spectrograph  of the European Southern Observatory.
               The spectrograph uses  a 20 cm by 80 cm echelle and cross-dispersing gratings.
               The  detector is a mosaic of two 2048 x 4096 pixel CCD's with 15  micrometer
              pixels.  The spectrograph is fiber fed and is  located in a spectrograph room
              under the Hobby-Eberly  Telescope.  ***
