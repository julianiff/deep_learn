Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Clouthier will develop sensitive spectroscopic   methods
              for detecting and characterizing reactive intermediates important   in
              semiconductor processing.  The approach will use free-jet expansions   of
              intermediates generated by pyrolysis, discharge, or chemical reaction   whose
              spectra will be examined using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or  
              resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).  Among the   intermediates
              studied will be germanium and silicon analogues of   halocarbenes, aluminum-
              and gallium-containing metal organic chemical   vapor deposition (MOCVD)
              intermediates, and sulfur-halide radicals.  Chemical vapor deposition and
              plasma processing are two techniques used   for manufacturing electronic
              devices in the semiconductor industry.  The   spectroscopic information from
              this work will aid in the understanding of   these processes and point the way
              to better and more methods.
