Abstract    :
              9531720  Maki  This is a renewed grant to a PI with more than thirty years  of
              distinguished accomplishments in superconductivity and  other phenomena
              involving symmetry breaking in condensed  matter physics.  The present grant
              will study the d-wave  superconductivity.  A number of phenomena in the novel 
              superconductors e.g. High Tc cuprates, heavy fermions and  even some of the
              organic superconductors are currently  believed to derive from Cooper pairs in
              a finite angular  momentum (mostly l=2) ground state.  This grant also 
              includes a study of the vortex state of a d-wave  superconductor, including a
              detailed examination of the  density of states of quasiparticles and the
              anisotropies  that may be observable.  %%%  Many of the new discoveries in
              superconductivity seem to  indicate a new type of superconductivity.  In this
              new form,  the superconductors are anisotropic and sometimes have a  trace
              amount of resistance (dissipation).  This grant is a  program of research in
              the properties of the new form of  superconductivity with an attempt to
              identify the critical  experiments that can conclusively determine the role of
              the  new form.  ***
