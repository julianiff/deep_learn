Abstract    :
              9531005  Kioussis  This is a RUI grant to a PI with a moderate length record 
              with the Materials Theory program in DMR.  The PI is one of  the very few
              people who approach the problem of strongly  correlated fermions with a strong
              background in state of the  art ab-initio electronic band structure and also in
              the many  body techniques.  The current grant is to study unusual  magnetism
              and crystal field effects of a series of  monopnictides and monochalcogenides
              of Cerium and Uranium.  These compounds are isostructural and have been
              selected for  a controlled study of the correlated f-electrons,  incorporating
              the three essential subtleties of magnetism  all in one series:  Crystal Field
              effects, Kondo Effect and  exchange interaction.  %%%  Exotic magnetism is
              often found in the rare earth materials  and their compounds.  In this grant
              the objective is to  study  the magnetic properties of (1:1) compounds of
              Cerium  and Uranium, each with two columns in the periodic table:  group Vb,
              consisting of  (N, P, As, Sb and Bi) and the  chalcogens of  group VIb
              consisting of (O, S, Se, Te) using  state of the art techniques.  ***
