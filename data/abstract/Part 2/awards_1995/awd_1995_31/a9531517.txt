Abstract    :
                         This award will support the particpation of undergraduate  students
              in conducting hands-on, basic research in mammalian  genetics under the
              mentorship of staff scientists at Jackson  Laboratories.  During the program,
              which is 11 weeks long each  summer, students are exposed to all aspects of the
              research  process as well as participating in group sessions on careers, 
              ethics, critical scientific thinking, and a formal student  symposium.  This
              Research Experience for Undergraduates Site has  been very successful with 95%
              of former student participants now  in graduate or medical school or employed
              in science.       This award will foster the continued education and training 
              of individuals who will be part of our next generation of basic  researchers in
              the Biological Sciences.
