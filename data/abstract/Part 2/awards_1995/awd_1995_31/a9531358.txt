Abstract    :
                        Kauffman  9531358     An REU-site based at the Yellowstone-Bighorn
              Research Association in Red Lodge Montana, will engage eight students each year
              in research on late Pliocene to early Pleistocene drainage patterns in the
              northern Bighorn Basin.  The research will lead to publications and poster
              sessions by the participants at regional and/or national Geoscience meetings. 
              Students will be recruited from Western Montana College (no more than half) and
              other regional colleges, with a strong emphasis on attracting Native Americans
              and women.  Up to two of the students will be in-service, pre-college teachers.
               The PI will travel to area colleges to explain the program and recruit
              students, compensating for the lack of external communication and awareness of
              research opportunities at many schools with significant Native American
              populations.  Contact will be maintained with students during the subsequent
              academic year through electronic and regular mail, phone interactions, and
              personal visits.
