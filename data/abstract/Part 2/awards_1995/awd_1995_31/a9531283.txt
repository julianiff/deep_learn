Abstract    :
              9531283  Chu  This project addresses the critical substrate issue in the
              development of ZnSe based blue-green LEDs and laser diodes.  Recently, there
              has been much interest in the development of ZnSe based LEDs and laser diodes
              due to the tremendous market potential for their applications in displays,
              electronics, communications and information storage.  Among all the
              semiconductors, ZnSe is the only one which has been used to produce blue-green
              lasers.  However, the lifetime of the blue lasers has become a critical issue. 
              It is believed that the cause of the insufficient lifetime is the lack of
              device quality, lattice-matched ZnSe substrates.   An innovative technique
              (PPCVPT) to grow ZnSe crystals will be used.  Scientifically, the project will
              demonstrate that p-type ZnSe can be produced by minimizing the native defects.
              Two inch ZnSe for producing ZnSe lasers will be commercialized.  ZnSe laser
              diodes will also be produced in this project with the assistance of MBE
              capability at Columbia University.  The reliability of ZnSe lasers grown on
              ZnSe substrates will be tested.  Testing results will be used to improve the
              quality of the ZnSe substrates.
