Abstract    :
              The Santa Fe Institute will continue its REU program.  The  site will select a
              limited number of highly motivated and  talented undergraduates who can benefit
              from exposure to the  rich interdisciplinary mix of ideas at the Institute. 
              Women  and minorities will especially be invited to apply.  Senior  faculty
              mentors will be selected for their interest in the  program and each
              undergraduate will be matched with one or  more mentors who have research
              problems of real interest to  the student and to which the student can make a
              significant  contribution.  Other resident scientists will be encouraged  to
              take a regular interest in the intellectual development  of the interns.  The
              students will be encouraged to  participate fully in the intellectual life of
              the Institute  by attending colloquia and seminars and through informal 
              discussion of their work with other resident researchers.  Where appropriate,
              publication of scientific papers,  attendance at workshops, and release of
              student-developed  software will be encouraged by SFI.  During each student's 
              residency he will make a SFI colloquium presentation,  compile a written
              summary of his work, and frequently  consult with the program director. 
              Students are encouraged  to remain in contact with the Institute and their
              mentors as  their careers develop, and, if appropriate, to return for 
              subsequent scholarly visits.
