Abstract    :
              9531865    Jenkins    In this project the PI will participate in two
              hydrographic  surveys as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate 
              Experiment (ACCE), a U.S. contribution to the International World  Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The two surveys will cover  the central/western
              basin of the North Atlantic along 52deg W and  66deg W during the summer of
              1997.  Specifically, the PI will  provide support to collect and analyze water
              samples for their  content of Helium-3 and Tritium in order to use them to
              study  water mass formation and circulation on time scales ranging from  a few
              months to a few decades.  This time scale is critical to  the overall
              objectives of ACCE.
