Abstract    :
              9531219  Withers     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop a method for production of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
              silicon carbide (SiC) fibers tow, free of agglomeration or bridging between
              fibers.  Previous attempts to utilize CVD, which yields fibers with the
              requisite mechanical properties, have not successfully produced SiC fiber tow
              on graphite substrates without these problems.  Phase I demonstrated spreading
              of the graphite fiber tow substrate without agglomeration or bridging but with
              retention of high-temperature strength and at a projected cost one order of
              magnitude less than current cost.  Phase II will focus on continuous,
              trouble-free operation and a thorough understanding of processing variables. 
              Multiple-pound quantities of SiC fiber tow are expected and will be used in
              economic evaluation of the production process.     Commercial applications are
              expected in composites for energy, conversion, e.g., heat exchangers, hot gas
              filters, porous and tubular radiant burners, reformers waste incineration, in
              fusion reactor components, in gas turbine and internal combustion engine
              components, in aerospace structures, in various defense system components, and
              in sports equipment.
