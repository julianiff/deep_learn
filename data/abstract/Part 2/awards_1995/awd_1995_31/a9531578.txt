Abstract    :
                  Abstract      9531578  Messerschmitt    The Department of Electrical
              Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley is conducting an REU Site
              focusing on the topic of multimedia networking.  The overall goal of the
              research is to demonstrate new architectural solutions for the converged
              information and communication networks of the next century.  Six students will
              be recruited for this REU each summer with an emphasis on electrical
              engineering students from underrepresented groups.
