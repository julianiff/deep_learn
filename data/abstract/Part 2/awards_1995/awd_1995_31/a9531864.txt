Abstract    :
              9531864    Smethie    This project provides a contribution to the hydrographic
              work to  be done in the Western North Atlantic during the Atlantic Climate 
              Change Experiment (ACCE) of the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE). 
              Two meridional lines will be surveyed along  52 degrees West and 66 degrees
              West, from boundary to boundary.  The PI on this project will oversee the
              collection, processing,  and analysis of Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data on these
              surveys,  which will provide information on the spreading and transport of 
              water masses at various levels in the water column.  These lines  represent a
              major part of the US contribution to the WOCE  hydrographic program and ACCE.
