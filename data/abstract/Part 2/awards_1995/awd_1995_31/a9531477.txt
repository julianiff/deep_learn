Abstract    :
              Abstract  IBN 95-31477    This action funds a research starter grant to a former
              NSF  Minority Postdoctoral Fellow.    The research supported here continues a
              molecular and  genetic analysis of root-hair development  in the model  plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana.  Two root hair defective mutants  are being analyzed to
              determine if they have impaired  membrane transport properties.  Preliminary
              results suggest  that the mutations may be in genes of the Tonoplast 
              Instrinsic Protein family.  If so, they could be useful  tools in the study of
              differentiation and cell growth in  this important plant model system.
