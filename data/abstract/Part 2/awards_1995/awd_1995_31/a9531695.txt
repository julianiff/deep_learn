Abstract    :
                Support for two specific data analysis investigations is requested.   The
              first is an investigation of dayside aurora and associated  measurements of
              magnetopause locations obtained from simultaneous  ground based and satellite
              measurements.  They expect to be able to  distinguish between magnetopause
              motions which result from changes  in dynamic pressure and those due to flux
              erosion and hypothesize  that dayside auroral motions are associated only with
              the latter.   The second is a large statistcal investigation of a large
              database  of magnetopause crossings to extablish the relationship between 
              changes in magnetopause location and substorm activity.
