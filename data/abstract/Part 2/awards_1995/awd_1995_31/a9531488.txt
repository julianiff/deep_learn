Abstract    :
                              This award will support the participation of  10      
              undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences       for
              Undergraduates program offered by the Center for the       Integrative Study of
              Animal Behavior (CISAB) at Indiana       University, Bloomington.  The program
              is ten weeks in length       and focuses on recruiting undergraduate students
              from groups       currently underrepresented in the sciences.  This program is 
                   a new REU site that will build on the formal undergraduate      
              internship program offered by CISAB for the past two years       and on CISAB's
              collective experience with undergraduate       training.  Students will conduct
              research projects and       present their findings at a concluding symposium. 
              They will       also attend (1) a team-taught course introducing research      
              issues and techniques in the areas represented by CISAB       faculty, (2)
              classes on mentoring and career issues taught       via the Committee on
              Institutional Cooperation's campus-wide       Summer Research Opportunities
              Program, and (3) seminars on       ethics and conduct in science taught in
              conjunction with the       Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics & American   
                 Institutions.  The program will give students intensive       research
              experience and will introduce them to science as a       profession, to
              interdisciplinary modes of thinking, and to       specific research techniques
              used in the study of animal       behavior.            This award will foster
              the continued education and  training of individuals who   will be part of the
              next generation  of basic researchers in the diverse aspects of animal 
              behavior.
