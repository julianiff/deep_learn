Abstract    :
              9531487  Morrow   This REU site award will bring eight undergraduates to the
              University of   Washington to work on inverse problems. The inverse problem for
              an electrical network is   to determine the conductivity of each of the
              resistors in the network when the response of   the network to boundary
              voltages is known. The inverse problem in impedance   tomography is to
              determine the conductivity throughout the interior of a conducting body   from
              measurements of potentials and currents on the boundary. Students will
              investigate   relations between the response matrix of an electrical network
              and the conductors in the   network. They will also work on applications of
              these discrete problems to inverse   problems for conducting bodies.    The
              program will run for eight weeks. During the first week there will be lectures 
               describing known results, open problems, and numerical approaches. Students
              will then   begin working on projects of their own choosing, using the
              available computing facilities,   if appropriate. Students can work on their
              own or in teams of  two or three. They will   continue to meet at regularly
              scheduled times for the remaining weeks. At the end the   students will write
              papers on their projects.
