Abstract    :
              9531894  Carignan         The R/V BLUE FIN is used primarily to support research
               programs in biological, physical and chemical oceanography on the  S.E.
              Continental Shelf between Capes Hatteras and Canaveral.   The Blue Fin is a 72'
              general purpose research vessel owned and  operated by Skidaway Institute of
              Oceanography.  The vessel is  scheduled for 140 operational days in 1996, all
              are in support of  NSF-sponsored research.         The BLUE FIN is part of a
              fleet of ships used by the National  Science Foundation in support of marine
              science.  Most  oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and
               extensive support from highly trained crew members.  Increasingly,  research
              projects require equipment which must be permanently  installed on the vessel,
              thus requiring specialized vessels.  These  vessels do not operate the same as
              general cargo/fishing vessels,  as a result NSF supports the operation of a
              variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
              operated  by universities and research institutes around the country.  ***
