Abstract    :
              9531712  Silcox    This REU-Site award presents an outstanding opportunity for 
              fifteen undergraduates to engage in a materials research and  educational
              activity over a ten-week summer period with  faculty, students and staff in six
              interdisciplinary  research groups in the Materials Science Center.  The groups
               are pursuing an u understanding and control of materials at  the nanoscopic
              scale.  More specifically, the groups: (1)  use creative chemical synthesis to
              understand and enhance  the properties of  polymer phase boundaries;  (2)
              prepare  and characterize polymer nanocomposites of metallic  molecular
              clusters in polymer matrixes and layered  intercalation composites;  (3)
              explore the properties of  optically active composite materials;  (4) develop 
              understanding  and control of then film deposition on glass  and (95) develop
              understanding of film deposition using  energetic supersonic neutral and
              hyperthermal ion beam; and  exploit uniquely structured nanoscale materials to
              elucidate  fundamental issues of defects and impurities in quantum  systems and
              quantum transport.  %%%  The goals of this program include:  (1) enabling
              students to  experience the thrill of carrying out their own research;  and (2)
              encouraging students to use several world  central  facilities to perform their
              research and obtain marketable  technical skills for their future  careers. 
              Students will be required to prepare a written  report and present their
              research results orally at the end  of the Summer research forum.  ***
