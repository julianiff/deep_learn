Abstract    :
                              This award will support the participation of  10      
              undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences       for
              Undergraduates program offered by Southwestern Missouri       State University.
               This is an exciting program that offers       opportunities for research
              experience  in tropical studies.       Participants will learn and develop
              research skills by       interacting with faculty as they work on projects
              dealing       with tropical vertebrate communities in Mexico.  To foster      
              student development, a three-phase program is planned:  1)       Orientation -
              introducing students to research methodology       and ecological studies in
              Mexico; 2) Apprenticeship -       developing skills; and 3) Individual research
              - resulting in       publication-quality reports.  Seminars on research and    
                graduate studies are included to facilitate applications of       acquired
              knowledge and skills to participants' future       academic pursuits;
              presentations will be made by scientists       in both the United States and
              Mexico.  Faculty mentors will       "coach" students, instilling a vision of
              research by       explaining the rules of science and delivering a feeling of  
                  the excitement that comes with addressing questions with       conceptual
              orientations.  The theme or focus of the program       is vertebrate
              communities.  To capitalize on faculty       expertise, students will be
              encouraged to choose projects       involving fishes, amphibians, reptiles, or
              mammals, although       studies of other organisms are possible. 
              Investigations may       address aspects of niche dimensions, behavior,
              parasitic       infections, or systematics.  Students may choose projects      
              within these topics or develop investigations of their own.            This
              award will foster the continued education and  training of individuals who  
              will be part of the next generation  of basic researchers in tropical ecology. 
              With global  attention focused of the loss of biodiversity , especially in the 
              tropics, this is an area of   critical concern for the sustained  economic
              development and, in fact, the cultural survival    of  many developing nations.
