Abstract    :
              An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department of  the University of
              Massachusetts-Lowell.  Undergraduate  students will be given a rich experience
              in physics research  that will provide sufficient means for them to seriously 
              consider a research career in science.  The students will  carry out their own
              research in the setting of a research  group composed of other undergraduate
              students, graduate  students, and faculty.  This will foster both student- 
              student and student-faculty interaction.  Each student will  have a faculty
              mentor.  The students will be fully  integrated into the research groups and
              thus contribute  significantly to the research effort.  The major goal of the 
              program is to expose the students to a research environment  and have them
              develop some of the skills necessary for  carrying out physics research. 
              Another aim of the program  is to attract those students who would not normally
              have a  chance to do research and women, minority members, and the  disabled,
              groups who are typically underrepresented in  physics.  A supplementary ethics
              program that may be offered  will sensitize the students to the ethics involved
              in  scientific research.  Students will be housed on campus and  be offered a
              number of cultural, community, and recreational  activities.
