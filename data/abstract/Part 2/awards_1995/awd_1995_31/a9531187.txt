Abstract    :
              9531187  Marder  Using both analytical and numerical methods, this grant will 
              study the connection between the interatomic forces and the  behavior of
              materials during brittle fracture.  Some  questions to be asked are: "How does
              fracture occur on the  atomic scale?" "When do the cracks propagate in a stable
               manner and when do the instabilities set in?"   "What sorts  of interatomic
              forces lead to brittle, or to ductile  materials?"  "What are the effects of
              thermal fluctuations  upon fracture?"   "What are the differences between
              fracture  of amorphous and crystalline materials?"  The proposed  program of
              research also contains a strong collaboration  with experiments.  %%%  In spite
              of more than sixty years of development in the  modern understanding of
              materials, very little is known  about the atomic nature of the strength of
              materials or how  they fail under stress.  This grant plans to develop an atom-
               level understanding of the mechanical properties, especially  the ones related
              to failure.  What are the atoms doing when  a material fractures?  On an atomic
              level,  how is brittle  fracture different from ductile fracture?   What are
              the  atoms doing when a glass fractures, and when a metal  fractures?  ***
