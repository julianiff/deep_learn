Abstract    :
                         This award will support the participation of  ten talented 
              undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences for 
              Undergraduates program offered by the Microbiology Department at  the
              University of Texas, Austin.  This program, which encompasses  10 weeks each
              summer will allow the students to work in well-  funded and equipped
              laboratories in which the research being  conducted covers both prokaryotic and
              eukaryotic systems and  deals with membrane localization, DNA replication and 
              recombination, control of gene expression, immunological  mechanisms,
              pathogenic mechanisms and viral transformation.  Participants will work
              individually with faculty mentors but have  access to all faculty through
              seminars and informal discussions  in a format which is similar to that of
              previously supported  successful programs.  This new award will emphasize
              acquainting  students with the variety of post-graduate opportunities for 
              students interested in molecular biology.  Activities are geared  to promote
              interest in research careers and encourage students to  apply to graduate
              schools in molecular biology.       This award will foster the continued
              education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation
              of basic  researchers in the biological sciences.
