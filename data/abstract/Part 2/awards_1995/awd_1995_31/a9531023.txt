Abstract    :
              9531023  Cornwall       Research in theoretical physics will be done in
              virtually  every critical field of modern particle theory, including non- 
              perturbative field theory, lattice theory, supersymmetry, and  string theory. 
              Among the vital physical issues the studies will  help to resolve:  How are
              nucleons and electrons created and  destroyed in the early universe?  How does
              confinement of quarks  in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) really work?  How does
              one go  from a fundamental description of nature (via 10-dimensional  string
              theory) to an effective field-theory or string theory  description of our
              4-dimensional world, properly accounting for  all the quantum-mechanical
              phenomena not visible at the classical  level?  ***
