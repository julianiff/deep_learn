Abstract    :
                Abstract    9531589  Miller    The REU Site at the University of
              Michigan-Dearborn is established to perform applied research in the areas of
              machine vision, OCR, address block recognition, pattern recognition, and image
              processing.  Up to ten students will be selected for this program annually. 
              The students will work closely with a faculty advisor in the Department of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering at UM-D.  The research facilities at UM-D
              available for this project includes the Image Analysis Laboratory, Machine
              Vision Research Laboratory, Signal Processing Laboratory and the Engineering
              Computer Facilities.
