Abstract    :
                                      Abstract of the project (item C)                The
              principal investigator will continue to study the internal  structure theory of
              subnormal operators, with particular consideration  of finite rank
              self-commutator, the structure of invariant subspaces,  and connections and
              applications to other fields. He will use operator  theoretical tools to study
              the theory of quadrature domains. He also plans  to investigate the structure
              of invariant subspaces of the Bergman space  on the unit disk and multipliers
              between the Bergman spaces over a  general bounded region.             
              Operator theory is a central discipline in modern mathematics that  studies
              infinite dimensional generalization of matrices. This type of  research is an
              attempt to classify operators satisfying additional  conditions given in terms
              of the associated operator or the   underlying space.  They have rich
              applications in every applied science   as well as pure mathematics. To mention
              a specific example, one of   basic H-infinity control problems was developed by
              the classical   mathematical theory of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation.
              Applications of   the theory include improvement in automobile suspension
              systems,   airplane flight control, chemical process control, etc.
