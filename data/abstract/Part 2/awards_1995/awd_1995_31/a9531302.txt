Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9513102  Dowding    The objective of this REU Site at Northwestern
              University is to attract students to research careers on materials of interest
              to civil engineering, to train students in the use of interdisciplinary
              research teams, and to provide a model for and produce baseline data for
              implementation of interdisciplinary team research programs for undergraduates
              that are applicable for other fields of study, i.e., polymers, electronic
              materials, environmental, biological sciences, etc.  Plans are to recruit
              students from all engineering disciplines and mathematics, chemistry and
              physics majors also.  Student activities will include attending an intensive
              course of study in interdisciplinary research, conducting individual research,
              participating in interdisciplinary research group meetings, regularly
              interacting with a faculty advisor, writing a publication quality research
              paper and giving an oral report.
