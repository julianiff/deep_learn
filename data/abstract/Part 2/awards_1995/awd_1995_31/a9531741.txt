Abstract    :
              This project will combine Wilcox Solar Observatory field data and spacecraft
              in-situ data or coronagraph activities to examine at least three questions
              related to the connection between evolution of the solar field and coronal and
              interplanetary phenomena.  These questions include:  (1) What is the
              relationship between the solar cycle variation of the flux out of the source
              surface and the occurrence rates of coronal mass ejections and their opposite
              counterparts, interplanetary solar wind heat flux dropouts?  (2) What is the
              relationship between the coronal field structure evolution, as seen in the
              coronal field models, and the locations and characteristics of coronagraph
              CMEs?  (3) What is the relationship between the appearance of interplanetary
              coronal mass ejection fields and the structure of the coronal fields in their
              projected source regions?  Results of these studies will provide new ways of
              exploiting global solar magnetic field observations as a multi-purpose tool for
              understanding and predicting interplanetary transient phenomena.
