Abstract    :
              The scientific study of human behavior in organizations relies exclusively on
              the observation of behavior either under naturally occurring conditions or
              those that are contrived, conditions that Cronbach labeled as the two
              disciplines of scientific psychology (Cronbach, 1957; 1975).  While these
              disciplines differ in their assumptions about the interface between theory and
              data, they both require that scientific knowledge relevant to human behavior
              must be based on the observation of actual behaviors.  Recently, the study of
              behavior has begun to take advantage of knowledge gained from research based on
              computational or mathematical models and computer simulations in which no
              actual behaviors of people are involved.  These models/simulations have been
              found to be quite useful for advancing understanding of large macro-level
              systems, such as global climate conditions or the nature of organizational
              structures and other behaviors of the firm.  They have also proved useful for
              advancing understanding of micro-level systems, in particular, cognitive
              architectures of problem solving and thinking.  At the level of individuals'
              behaviors in organizations, the use of such models for aiding understanding of
              behavior have been rare.  Yet, there are many reasons to believe that
              computational modeling, mathematical models and computer simulations can be
              just as valuable at the individual level of behavior as they have been at the
              more macro- and micro- levels.  This support is for a conference designed to
              stimulate work in computational models for advancing the understanding of human
              behavior in work organizations.  The stimulation of interest will be
              accomplished by attracting high quality participants to the conference,
              conducting the conference in a manner designed to stimulate the creation of
              quality papers, and also by actively recruiting and supporting the attendance
              of young scholars in the field.  This conference is being jointly funded with
              the American Psychological Association and the Office of Naval Research.
