Abstract    :
                         The Pomona College Department of Biology has a long-standing 
              commitment to teaching students how to investigate and solve  scientific
              problems and a strong tradition of involving  undergraduates in biological
              research in meaningful ways.  In the  REU Sites program at Pomona College
              students will work jointly  with Ph.D.-holding faculty advisors on projects in
              a variety of  fields, including molecular biology, population and behavioral 
              biology, physiology and cell biology.  Students will also  participate in a
              number of support activities that will provide  them with the opportunity to
              discuss their projects with other  student researchers and with younger
              students who are considering  doing research.  The student-faculty research
              community will hold  regular informal research meetings and open houses.  All
              students  will present the results of their work at a science poster 
              conference.       This award will foster the continued education and training 
              of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in
              the biological sciences.
