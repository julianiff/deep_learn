Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of new organosilicon   compounds
              that have unusual chemical  bonding .  Targets include silynes,   silaallenes
              and silamones.  Silole anions and dianions with be reacted   with transition
              metals to obtain new types of silole-metal complexes and   the chemical
              reactions of stable silylenes will be investigated.  Also,   by vaporization of
              carbon mixed with silicon carbide or elemental   phosphorus, new fullerene
              carbon cages, containing silicon or phosphorus   atoms in the cage framework,
              will be prepared.  With this renewal award,   the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research of Dr. Robert   West of the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of Wisconsin.    Professor West will focus his work on the
              synthesis of new types of   organosilicon compounds that contain unusual
              chemical bonding patterns.    The molecules to be constructed test the limits
              of the ability of silicon   to bond with carbon and are expected to have
              interesting chemical   properties.
