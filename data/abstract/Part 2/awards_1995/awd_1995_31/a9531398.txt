                ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:   CTS-9531398    Principal Investigator: Durbin  
                The objective of this work is to bring existing theories of turbulent
              dispersion, results of basic experiments and comprehensive data from numerical
              simulations to bear upon the problem of developing engineering models of scalar
              variance.  Scalar variance plays a central role in turbulent combustion and
              bears upon problems in environmental pollution and heat transfer.  In terms of
              fundamental science, scalar fluctuations are basic to understanding the
              mechanisms of turbulent mixing. Scalar dissipation plays a central role in
              modeling mixing, yet current model equations have known deficiencies.  This is
              a work will take a fresh look at the existing models, in light of recent
              experiments and simulations and will extend the data base with additional
              simulations.  This work should provide significant insights into the modeling
              of the variance.  ***
