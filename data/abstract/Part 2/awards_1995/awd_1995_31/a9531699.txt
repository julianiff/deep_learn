Abstract    :
              ***  9531688  Kossler  The REU Site in the Physics Department of the College of 
              William and Mary will be continued.  Most of the  undergraduate students
              selected for this program will join  the research programs of the Department
              while several will  join on-going research at nearby Laboratories (such as 
              CEBAF, NASA-Langley, and the William and Mary School of  Marine Science). 
              Students, will be recruited nationally,  and it is expected that most will come
              from other schools.  ***
