Abstract    :
              Dr. James A. Ibers, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the
              Chemistry Division for research into soluble metal selenides and   tellurides.
              The objective of the project is to develop the chemistry of   metal-selenium
              and tellurium anionic clusters, species which are known to   differ markedly
              from corresponding metal-sulfides. Varied synthetic   techniques, which are
              based on the reactions of metal compounds with   polyselenides  or
              polytellurides in  non-aqueous solvents, on   chalcogenide substitution
              reactions, and on reduction of metal   chalcogenides by alkali metals in liquid
              ammonia, will be designed. The   compounds will be characterized by selenium
              and tellurium nmr and by   x-ray diffraction.  Selenium and tellurium, often
              combined with small amounts of other   metals, are widely used as components in
              semiconductors and other   advanced materials. In this project new routes will
              be developed for the   preparation of substances composed of several selenium
              or tellurium atoms   and one or a few metal atoms. These 'clusters' will be
              designed to bear   an electrical charge, which will result in their being
              soluble in various   solvents. As such they may find use in the formation of
              new electronic   substances.
