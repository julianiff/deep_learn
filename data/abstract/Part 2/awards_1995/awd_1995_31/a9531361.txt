Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9531361  Krantz    This REU site program in membranes and thin film
              research will constitute ten (10) weeks of research work, training programs,
              educational seminars, cultural programs and recreational activities for the
              expected twelve (12) students annually.  Each student will be assigned an
              individual research project and it will be conducted under the guidance of a
              faculty advisor.  The students will interact closely with the faculty, graduate
              students and others in a supportive environment.  Typical research project
              areas are:  bioseparations, biomedical membrane applications, filtration,
              nonlinear optics, polymeric membrane formation, thin liquid film dynamics,
              photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis and microdynamics.
