Abstract    :
              This work, directed by Assistant Professor Robert T. Kennedy of the   University
              of Florida, is centered on problems of qualitative and   quantitative
              measurement of chemicals associated with neurotransmission   processes in the
              central nervous system.   Support is provided by the   Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.    Miniaturized sampling systems
              coupled to capillary separation techniques   will be developed with the long
              range goal of high speed in vivo   measurements.  Both microdialysis and
              push-pull perfusion will be   investigated as sampling systems.  On-line
              chemical derivatization will   yield products suitable for laser induced
              fluorescence detection or   electrochemical detection.  The latter uses the
              biuret reaction to form   Cu(II) complexes with peptide neurotransmitters.  To
              enhance sensitivity,   a dual electrode detector arrangment will be used in
              which the complex   recycles back and forth between the anode and cathode.  An
              understanding of the chemical basis of the functioning of the nervous   system
              would be of great benefit in the treatment of neurological   diseases.  To
              achieve this, it is necessary to identify and quantify the   chemicals involved
              and to be able to follow their changes temporily and   spatially.  The major
              objective of this project is to provide solutions   to the measurement problems
              presented by the  small volumes, the low   concentrations, the presence of a
              large number of different chemicals and   the short response time that are
              encountered in such investigations.
