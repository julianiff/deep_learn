Abstract    :
              9531782    Accurate and speedy field testing to evaluate soil  characteristics
              and  behavior is needed to support society's need for continued  investment in 
              infrastructure development and rehabilitation.  The  piezocone penetrometer 
              (PCP) is the increasingly chosen investigation tool to meet  this demand.  The
              proposed research aims to develop an anisotropic, rate-  dependent 
              constitutive model and an Arbitrary-Lagrangean-Eularean  (ALE) finite  element
              code to predict for the first time, cone resistance  and excess pore  water
              pressures at various rates of cone penetration.  The  capability of  the model
              will be verified and validated by state-of-the-art  calibration  chamber tests
              that will focus on penetration rate, lateral  stress  coefficient,
              overconsolidation ratio, and scale effects on  cone data.  Interpretation of
              non-standard pore water pressure  dissipation curves  arising from initial
              excess pore pressure drop due to normal  stress  reduction and its initial
              variation with respect to  redistribution and  stress history effects will be
              investigated.  This research  will formulate  accurate simplified methods and
              charts to evaluate  engineering soil  parameters, ground improvement
              effectiveness, and  performance of deep  foundations (i.e. increase in pile
              capacity with time) from  PCP test data.  ***
