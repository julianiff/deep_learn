Abstract    :
              9531886  DeGrandpre    This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              will  develop deploy a new long term, CO2 sensor on a mooring that will 
              over-winter on Georges Bank as part of the GLOBEC global change  research
              program.  The PI has developed a new instrument called  SAMI-CO2 for measuring
              CO2 levels (Submersible Autonomous Moored  Instrument - CO2).  Measuring the
              partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is  important to many types of investigations
              involving climatic  studies.  Long term measurements have been difficult to
              make.  This  deployment opportunity represents an effective way to provide the 
              research community with a rigorous field evaluation.  The work will  also
              contribute to the GLOBEC program that is seeking to determine  dominant control
              of sea surface pCO2 levels for ocean-atmosphere  climate models and to improve
              our understanding of air-sea gas  exchange mechanisms.
