Abstract    :
              9531832  Smithson    This grant provides $55,000 as partial support of  the
              costs of acquiring computational equipment to  be used for processing, analysis
              and  interpretation of seismic data in the Department  of Geology and
              Geophysics at the University of  Wyoming.  Specifically, the equipment to be 
              purchased will include a multiprocessor Silicon  Graphics Power Challenge L
              Server with 34 GB of  hard drive space and PROMAX 3-D seismic processing 
              software.  This equipment will be used by faculty  and graduate students at
              Wyoming to conduct  research utilizing seismic refraction and  reflection data
              for investigations including, but  not limited to, lithospheric structure and 
              continental assemblages in SE Alaska, 3-D crustal  structure in West
              Antarctica, high resolution  profiles of the upper crust to study fluid 
              migration and monitoring of underground nuclear  tests.  ***
