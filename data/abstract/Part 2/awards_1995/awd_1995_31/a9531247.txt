Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Missouri at Columbia
              acquire an upgrade of an  existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of  areas including the following: (1)
              Investigation of DNA cleavage by 1,2-Dithiolan-3-one 1-  oxides, (2) Studies of
              4+3 cycloaddition reactions, (3) Organization of vascular metabolism: 
              structural basis and function, (4) Nitrosamine, nitrosation, and related
              diazenium ion chemistry,  and (5) Determination of enzyme mechanisms        
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from 
              these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in
              biology.
