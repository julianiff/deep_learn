Abstract    :
                     Ash 9531675  This award provides funding for a project that addresses
              some of the  connections between groups of integral matrices and the number
              theoretical aspects of systems of polynomial equations with integer
              coefficients. In particular, it studies the cohomology of arithmetic groups as
              a  module for the Hecke algebra, with connections to motives and Galois 
              representations and automorphic forms on adele groups. A theory of  p-adic
              families of cohomology classes for general arithmetic groups,  with particular
              application to subgroups of finite index in GL(m) is considered. Also
              investigated is a series of computer calculations designed to probe for the
              existence of non-selfdual automorphic  representations of cohomological type,
              and another series to test a  conjecture  relating modular Galois
              representations to Hecke eigenclasses in the cohomology of GL(3,Z) with twisted
              coefficients mod p.  This project falls into the general area of Arithmetic
              Algebraic  Geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
              mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry.  This combination has proved
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
              generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such
              codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
