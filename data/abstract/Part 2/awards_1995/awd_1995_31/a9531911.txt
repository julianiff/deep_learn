Abstract    :
              ECS-9531911  Pujara    The main focus of this project is to investigate some
              necessary and sufficient conditions for an interval polytope of characteristic
              polynomial to contain a stable polynomial.  In this project, this problem will
              be called the "Interval Polytope Problem".  Note that a polytope is being
              called an interval polytope if it is generated by an uncertain characteristic
              polynomial with independent coefficients.  The proposed investigation centers
              around the conjecture: if an interval polytope contains a stable polynomial,
              then the Kharitonov rectangle of at least one of the maximal subpolytopes
              contains a stable polynomial.  There is a strong basis to surmise that the
              conjecture is true.  This optimism is based on some very recent results of the
              PI which show that the conjecture is true for interval polytopes of dimension
              up to five.  In addition to this, an investigation of numerical examples of
              interval polytopes of large order also reveals that the conjecture is true for
              these numerical examples.  To make sure that the investigation of these
              numerical examples really truly reveals the truth, arbitrarily large and small
              bounds were considered around the coefficients of stable polynomials, ranging
              from six to nineteen degrees.  A successful resolution of the interval polytope
              problem would lead to new techniques which will throw some additional light on
              a possible approach to solve the more difficult and important question: what
              are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a general polytope of
              polynomials to contain a stable polynomial?  Two important applications of the
              general polytope case are also mentioned which are the main driving force
              behind this research area.
