              REU:  Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Tools for Concurrent
              Programming    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
              support six students in Summer programs each year, for three years.  The goal
              of the project is to continue an already established REU site program so as to
              continue to provide opportunities for highly talented and qualified upper
              division women, minority and disabled undergraduate students to participate in
              research programs in the field of parallel processing.  The students will
              investigate problems related to parallel program development, debugging,
              scheduling, and performance profiling under the supervision of the principal
              investigators and faculty mentors and in collaboration with graduate students. 
              The students will be recruited nationally with emphasis on recruitment of
              students from institutions lacking research facilities and located in the
              southwest region of the United States.  ***
