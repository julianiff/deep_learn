Abstract    :
                9531160  Taylor    This award provides funding for acquisition of shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. Instrumentation  funded
              includes a CD-ROM writer, a rock saw, a multi-purpose winch,  and an ARGOS
              reference platform.    The shipboard instruments will be used aboard the R/V
              MOANA WAVE,  a 213 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and operated by the 
              University in order to provide necessary support to NSF-funded  projects during
              1996 and to enhance the scientific capability of  the research vessel in the
              future.
