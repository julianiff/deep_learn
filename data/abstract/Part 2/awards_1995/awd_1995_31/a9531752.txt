Abstract    :
              The PI intends to improve basic understanding of the climatology (long term
              variations) of the F-region ionosphere.  He will perform a detailed analysis of
              the seasonal and solar cycle variations of the ionospheric peak electron
              density, primarily to determine the reasons for the density variation as a
              function of solar activity.  Better ionospheric models, important for both
              military and commercial applications, will improve capabilities of
              over-the-horizon radar.  The PI will study causes of the observed density
              variation with an innovative theoretical ionosphere model, known as the FLIP
              model, which is capable of utilizing three key ionospheric measurements as
              constraints.
