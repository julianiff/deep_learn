Abstract    :
              9531215  Rawson       This award provides funding to purchase shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The  instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V Ewing, a 239 foot  vessel, which is owned and operated by
              the Observatory.  NSF  is the primary user of the ship.  Instrumentation funded
               includes a CHIRP sonar system, hardware to improve a  portable high resolution
              sound source system, streamer  leveling "birds", a SeaCat CTD profiler, a large
              diameter  gravity corer, and a SUN SPARCstation 20 for data logging  and
              processing.  ***
