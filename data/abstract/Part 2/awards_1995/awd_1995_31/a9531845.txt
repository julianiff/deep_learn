Abstract    :
              9531845  Slemrod         The project entails investigation into kinetic models
              and macroscopic  hydrodynamics of "gas like" systems which exhibits changes of
              phase.   The investigation will yield understanding of fundamental principles
              of  liquid-vapor phase transitions, computational methods for analysis of 
              liquid-vapor interface dynamics, and with respect to "gas like" modeling  of
              granular materials.  The tools used in the investigation will be  mathematical
              ideas in the kinetic theory of dense gases, asymptotic  analysis, and
              fundamental ideas in the theory of one complex variable (as  needed for the
              Yang-Lee theory of phase transitions).  The project will  then use these tools
              to develop the relevant macroscopic flow equations  for liquid-vapor systems
              including metastable states and analyze such  flows.  In addition, in the study
              of the granular flows the project will  develop the asymptotic ideas necessary
              to understand the issues of shear  band formation and elastic collapse in rapid
              granular flow.   %%%        The project will provide knowledge in several
              technologically important  fields.  For example, modeling of rapid flow of
              granular materials is  important in the transfer of bulk materials (coal,
              cereals,  pharmaceuticals).  New results in dynamics of liquid-vapor phase  
              transitions will provide new mathematical and computation techniques for  the
              studying the behavior aerosols, underwater detonations, and two  phase fluid
              flow in nuclear reactors.  Another possible benefit is that  ideas obtained in
              studying liquid-vapor flow may be carried over to phase  transitions in solids
              as well, e.g. modeling of modern "shape memory"  materials.   ***
