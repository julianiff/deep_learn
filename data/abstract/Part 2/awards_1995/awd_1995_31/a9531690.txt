               Although higher plants express heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, G
              proteins, which mediate signal transduction in animals, the function of G
              proteins in plant signal transduction is unclear.  This laboratory has produced
              transgenic plants that express human muscarinic cholinergic receptors (which
              activate  specific G proteins) or chimeric receptors that activate all
              mammalian G proteins.  In the transgenic tobacco plants the receptors mediate
              growth and gene induction responses with selectivity for receptor specific
              agonists and antagonists, showing that the receptors are acting via regulation
              of endogenous tobacco G proteins.   These receptors will be used to clarify the
              roles of G protein signaling pathways in tobacco.  The pathways will be
              identified by their ability to induce or repress transcription of specific
              regulated genes for which probes are availalbe.  The receptors will be used as
              affinity ligands to purify the tobacco G protein subunits which they regulate,
              and these will be identified by amino acid sequencing and cloning of their
              cDNAs.  These studies will identify t he signaling pathways that operate in
              these plants as well as the G proteins that activate them. ***
