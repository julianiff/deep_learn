Abstract    :
              9531847  Measures    The western Atlantic is a good location for examining the
              effects  of multiple inputs, biogeochemical processes, and circulation on  the
              concentrations of trace elements. This study will examine the  interaction
              between inputs, cycling, and transport for Al, Be, Fe,  As, Se, Sb, and other
              trace elements in the western Atlantic.  The  cruise track provides
              opportunities to collect samples from nearly  all of the major intermediate and
              deep water masses in the  Atlantic, as well as a detailed surface transect
              across the western  boundary currents in the south Atlantic, the equatorial 
              Atlantic/ITCZ (which receives large amounts of Saharan dust), and  the Amazon
              plume, (supplying terrestrial organic ligands, suspended  sediments, and
              colloidal matter). This cruise track will also meet  the second research
              objective, to coordinate and execute the third  Intergovernmental Oceanographic
              Commission Baseline Expedition for  Trace Metals and Organic Contaminants in
              the western South and  equatorial Atlantic. The stated goal of these
              expeditions, as  envisioned by the IOC, is to characterize the major water
              masses of  the world's oceans for as many contaminants as possible so that 
              changes due to anthropogenic activity can be identified.
