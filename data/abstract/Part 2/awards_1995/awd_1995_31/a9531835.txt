Abstract    :
              9531835  Ray  The emphasis of this analytical and experimental research  project
              is to enhance the science and technology base for on-  line monitoring of 
              material damage and prediction of  residual service life in complex mechanical
              structures.  Potential application areas include automotive and aircraft 
              related mechanical systems, electric power plants, and pulp  and paper mills,
              and discrete production processes such as  manufacture of ceramics and
              semiconductors, where structural  durability of plant components and
              operational reliability  are critical. Based on the understanding of physical 
              phenomena and the data available, analytical deterministic  models of damage
              dynamics are formulated for selected  materials in a continuous time-setting as
              opposed to the  commonly used cycle-based models of fatigue damage.  Stochastic
              modeling of fatigue dynamics is advanced based on  an ensemble of
              experimentally generated statistical data. An  on-line damage monitoring system
              is built using the  stochastic model with series inputs from basic sensing 
              elements. Experimental validation of the concept is  accomplished via a test
              apparatus fabricated in the  laboratory with equipment and test samples
              provided by NASA  Lewis and Sikorsky Aircraft Company respectively.***
