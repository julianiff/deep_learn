Abstract    :
              9531221  Gurtin    This project is a continuation of a research effort toward
              developing,   analyzing, and unifying mathematical models that characterize
              material   behavior at a phenomenological level. The long-term goal of this
              project is   a continuum-mechanical framework for the study of materials that
              provides   a basis for general theories and leads to boundary-value problems of
                physical relevance. The following specific studies are planned: (i) the  
              development of a small-strain theory of incoherent phase transitions that  
              results in free-boundary problems amenable to analysis and computation;   (ii)
              the development of a theory of deformational phase transitions   appropriate to
              fully faceted crystals; (iii) the  analysis of models that   generalize motion
              by curvature.    The goal of this project is a continuum mechanical framework
              for the study   of materials.  This framework should provide a basis for the
              development of   general theories that lead to new ways of understanding
              defects and   microstructures and provide an ability to  predict macroscopic
              properties as   well as detailed behavior at the microscopic level.
