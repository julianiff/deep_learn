Abstract    :
              ***  9531427  Kowbel       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project is devoted to demonstrating the uniqueness of corrosion protection of
              silicon carbide ceramics (SiC-SiC composites).  The SiC-SiC composites used as
              the substrate contain high temperature creep resistant chemical vapor reaction
              (CVR) SiC fibers developed by the firm. These fibers are expected to greatly
              enhanced market penetrations of chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) SiC-SiC
              composites in energy-related markets by providing high benefit to cost ratios. 
              However, the use of these composites in corrosive environments at temperatures
              above 1200 degrees C calls for corrosion protection coatings.  The alumina
              (SiCw - A12O3) coatings produced in Phase I offer a great potential in this
              area.  The successful completion of Phase I demonstrated dense, adherent,
              crack-free, thermal shock resistant coatings deposited on a SiC substrate.  In
              the Phase II this technology will be extended to include SiC-SiC tubular
              substrates with the goal of achieving excellent corrosion protection at
              temperatures up to 1400 degrees C.  In addition, efforts will be made to obtain
              high fracture toughness SiCw-Al2O3 coatings on SiC substrates.  The success of
              the Phase II effort will ensure several commercial applications of this
              technology in energy-related, cutting tools as well as other areas.     The
              potential applications include heat exchanger tubes, gas turbine engines,
              advanced aircraft engines, heat engine, filter applications and cutting tools.
