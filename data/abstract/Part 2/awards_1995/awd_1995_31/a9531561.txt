Abstract    :
              9531561  Maki   This REU site award will provide ten undergraduate mathematics
              majors, recruited   nationwide, with a research topic and a research
              environment which is as close to that of a   working mathematician as is
              possible, given the student s background. Each student will   work with a
              single faculty member. Sample topics are: Root Systems and Weyl Groups,  
              Modeling Uncertainty in Economics, Topology of Planar Linkages, Logic with
              Diagrams,   and Speech Recognition by Computers. The students will meet
              privately with their faculty   advisors two to three times a week. Throughout
              the eight weeks the students will give   frequent progress reports to the
              group. One of the most important aspects of the program   is the interaction
              among the students themselves. For some this will be their first   opportunity
              to get to know other students of comparable mathematical interest and ability. 
               This interaction will be encouraged in a number of ways. The students will be
              living   together in a single dormitory and eating in the same cafeteria. There
              will be a room in the   Mathematics Department in which students can gather to
              work. During the last week the   students will give lectures on the work they
              have done. They will also prepare written   reports on their work. These will
              be collected into a single bound volume.
