Abstract    :
                   This award will provide opportunities for undergraduate  students to
              participate in summer research projects in  microbiology, molecular biology and
              related fields at the  University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Students will be
              provided with  hands-on experience and become familiar with research techniques
               of microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology  using modern
              equipment and facilities in the Department of  Bacteriology.  Students will
              attend professional seminars and  make written and oral presentations of their
              own research  findings.  The program has an established record of attracting 
              motivated students and stimulating them to pursue careers in  research.      
              This award will foster the continued education and training  of our next
              generation of basic researchers in the Biological  Sciences.  Students trained
              in the specific areas of this program  will acquire experience that can lead to
              research careers or  possibly to technical work in health related research.
