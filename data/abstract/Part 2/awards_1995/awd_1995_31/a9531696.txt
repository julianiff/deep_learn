Abstract    :
                9531696  Hull    This research project aims, through combined experimental and
              theoretical work, for  development of a process simulator for energetic,
              kinetic and electronic descriptions of  misfit dislocations in strained layer
              semiconductor epitaxy. The primary goals of the  program are to: provide a
              coherent framework and a repository for experimental data relati  ng to misfit
              dislocations in strained layer epitaxy; incorporate mechanistic understanding 
              of the different processes involved in plastic relaxation in strained layer
              epitaxy, and to  combine this with experimental descriptions of these processes
              to enable predictive  simulation of the extent of plastic relaxation as a
              function of thermal history du  ring growth, annealing and materials
              processing; and to define quantitative relationships  between the
              structure/density of misfit dislocation arrays and their electronic properties,
               and incorporate these relationships into the process simulator to allow
              modeling of device  ramifications of plastic relaxation. The approach to these
              goals includes: a  ddressing shortcomings in experimental descriptions of
              kinetic processes in plastic  relaxation, especially the dislocation nucleation
              process; to quantitatively determine the  effects of critical materials
              processing steps--implantation and  activation/metallization/oxidation) upon
              plastic relaxation; to correlate misfit  dislocation structure and densities
              with their effect on electronic properties of the host  structure, and, to
              investigate the effects of device operation on the dislocation  microstructure,
              and appropriate software development. The intent is to develop this concept 
              such that at the conclusion of the program, the simulator will be available for
              general  distribution within the scientific community.  %%%  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at the fundamental atomic  level
              of technological relevance to several aspects of advanced microelectronic
              devices and  integrated circuitry. Additional ly, the knowledge and
              understanding gained from this  research project is expected to contribute in a
              general way to improving the perfor  mance of advanced devices and circuits
              used in computing, information processing, and  telecommunications by providing
              a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved
              materials. An important feature of the program is the integration of  research
              and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and techno 
              logically significant area.  ***  _
