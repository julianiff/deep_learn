Abstract    :
                 This is an interinstitutional collaborative project.  Combinatorial data
              consisting of sequences, trees, and graphs arise in many scientific
              disciplines.  For example, the primary structure of proteins is a sequence,
              whereas the tertiary structure is a graph.  Comparing such data to find
              similarities entails the use of a "distance metric" that mea  sures the
              difference between two data items.  Numerous distance metrics are possible. 
              This work consists primarily of (i) inventing efficient ways to compute known
              distance metrics; (ii) developing a data structure to decide which of a set of
              data items is "closest" (according to a given distance metric) to a new data
              item; (iii) techniques and s  oftware for discovering patterns with minimum or
              near-minimum distance to a given set of data items with respect to a given
              distance metric; and (iv) software to solve such discovery problems on networks
              of occasionally idle workstations.  This work will help every field in which
              approximate matching is important. Significant applications are expe  cted to
              molecular biology and rational drug design, as well as to finding patterns in
              linguistic strings.
