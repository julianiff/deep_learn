              Undergraduate (REU)   SITE to provide research experiences for summer fellows
              to   participate in interdisciplinary research programs which examine   the
              physical and biological functioning of estuarine ecosystems.  It will acquaint
              the students with the excitement and   opportunities of academic research, and
              encourage them to pursue   graduate studies and a career in ocean sciences  ***
