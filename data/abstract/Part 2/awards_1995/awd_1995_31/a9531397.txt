              Abstract  ATM-9531397  Andrews, John  University of Colorado, Boulder  Title:
              Paleoclimate (0 to >14 ka) of W and NW Iceland, A Comparison          of Lake
              and Near-Shore Marine Proxy Records: A USA/Iceland          Contribution to
              P.A.L.E.    Iceland is located on the eastern side of Denmark Strait in a 
              region where changes in the extent and duration of sea ice have  major impacts
              on both the marine and terrestrial environments.   This area monitors the
              relative strength of both the northward  advection of Atlantic Water and the
              southward flux of sea ice and  freshwater in the East Greenland Current.  This
              PALE/ARCSS award  supports the recovery of a series of sediment cores from
              lakes in  NW Iceland and compares their proxy records of climate with proxy 
              records from marine cores taken from fjords and shelf-troughs off  northwestern
              Iceland.  Based on earlier PALE studies,  decadal/centennial sampling
              resolution is realistic in both  environments, and correlations within systems
              and between lakes and  the offshore are enhanced by an abundance of regional
              tephras.  A  major Icelandic contribution to the grant will include ship-time
              to  carry out coring along three fjord shelf transects in northwestern 
              Iceland.
