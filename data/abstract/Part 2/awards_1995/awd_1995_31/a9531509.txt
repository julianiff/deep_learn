Abstract    :
              9531509  Chen    This award supports a planning visit to China to develop a 
              joint research project on the evolution of material failure.  The US PI, Dr.
              Zeng Chen, is an assistant professor at the  Department of Civil Engineering,
              University of Missouri at  Columbia.  His expectation from the research
              planning visit  is to define a program of cooperation with an important, 
              well-equipped laboratory in China, the Laboratory for Non-  linear Mechanics of
              Continuous Media, within the Institute  of Mechanics.  This lab has a large
              interdisciplinary group  exploring metal failure responses at different scales
              based  on the kinematics of deformation mechanisms.  This research  should
              contribute to better understanding of the  micromechanics of material failure
              and to improving failure  prediction.
