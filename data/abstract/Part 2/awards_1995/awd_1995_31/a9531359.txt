Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Skidmore College for a summer program for
              undergraduates to provide them with research experiences in cognitive and
              developmental psychology.   Ten students will be selected for the six-week
              program.  Projects serving as the focus of the summer experience will include
              the study of children's memory confusions, individual differences in imagery
              ability and their relationship to memory, factors mediating face recognition
              under conditions of incomplete visual information, and the effects on fact
              recognition of identical experiences.  Activities will include an orientation
              workshop, courses on research methods and data analysis, and student
              presentations of the results of their work.  The goal will be to promote ways
              for students to secure more sustained laboratory experiences culminating in
              independent research projects.  This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
