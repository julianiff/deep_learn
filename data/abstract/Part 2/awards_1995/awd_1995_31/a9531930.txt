Abstract    :
              9531930  Grujicic  The objective of the proposed research is a multi-scale 
              analysis of the role of martensitic phase transformation in  inhibiting crack
              propagation.  The key idea is that this  mechanism of crack closure would be
              better understood if one  could link the stress-assisted and strain-induced
              martensite  formation to the state of stress imposed on the actual atoms  at
              the extreme tip of a crack.  The modeling effort will use  computer simulation
              techniques (molecular dynamics and the  finite element method) to analyze the
              fracture behavior of  transformation toughened metallic materials and the 
              predictions will be validated through metallic systems  investigated in earlier
              work.  This research should help to  bridge the gap between information gained
              at different  microstructural length scales, atomistic and macroscopic.  ***
