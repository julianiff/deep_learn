Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Buckius  9531772       The proposed work focuses on radiative
              scattering from surfaces whose roughness is on the same scale as the wavelength
              of the incident radiation.  Rigorous and approximate approaches to analysis
              will be verified by experimental measurements for a variety of random rough and
              configured surfaces.  Applications to detection of defects in semiconductor
              manufacturing and to improved computer graphics are envisioned.
