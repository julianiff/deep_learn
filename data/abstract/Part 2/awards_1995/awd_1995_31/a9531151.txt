Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the rational development of chiral   nonracemic
              sulfer-nitrogen reagents including N-sulfinylaziridines,   primary sulfonamides
              and N-fluorosulfonimides.  New N-sulfinylaziridines   will be used in the
              enantioselective preparation of 2H-azirines and   2H-azirine 2-carboxylic
              acids, both useful intermediates for the   preparation of bioactive
              nitrogen-containing compounds.   Other research   will focus on the use of
              achiral  N-fluorosulfonimides as agents for   site-specific fluorination. With
              this renewal award, the Synthetic   Organic Program is supporting the research
              of Dr. Franklin A. Davis of   the Department of Chemistry at Temple University.
               Professor Davis will   focus his work on the use of sulfur-nitrogen reagents
              for the preparation   of enantiomerically pure compounds.  The synthesis of
              enantiomerically   pure compounds is an important objective since biological
              activity often   depends critically on the molecular shape and absolute
              stereochemistry of   molecules.
