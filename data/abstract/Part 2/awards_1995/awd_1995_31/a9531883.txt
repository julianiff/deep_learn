Abstract    :
              9531883    Schlosser    In this project the PI will participate in the Spring,
              1997  hydrographic survey as part of the Atlantic Circulation and  Climate
              Experiment (ACCE), a U.S. contribution to the  International World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The  survey will cover the central/eastern
              basin of the sub polar gyre  in the North Atlantic between Greenland and the
              Azores.  Specifically, the PI will provide support to collect and analyze 
              water samples for their content of Helium-3, Tritium, and Oxygen-  18 in order
              to use them to study water mass formation and  circulation.  Specific studies
              include convection of surface  waters to intermediate depth, communication of
              changes at the sea  surface to the deep waters, and sources of water for
              convection  and surface freshwater balance.  Data will also be used to 
              constrain model-simulated deep water formation rates, as well as  simulated
              penetration of near-surface signals into the deep  ocean.
