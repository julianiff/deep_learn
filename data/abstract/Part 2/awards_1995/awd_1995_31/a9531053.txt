Abstract    :
              9531053  Ritchie    This REU-Site award will provide an opportunity for ten 
              upper-division undergraduate students to engage in  experimental and
              theoretical condensed matter physics  research during a nine week summer
              program.  Examples of  research projects include:  materials structural 
              characterization; imaging of magnetic recording media  structures using
              magnetic force microscopy; ion channeling  studies of semiconductor alloy films
              on silicon substrates;  scanning transmission electron microscopy studies of
              the  structure of carbon nanotubules and of nanometer-size  particles; phonon
              lifetime studies in semiconductors;  quantum mechanical-based simulations of
              complex materials  and biological systems; and quantum Monte Carlo simulations 
              to calculate the electronic structure of atoms and  molecules, properties of
              clusters of atoms; and quantum  fluids and solids.  %%%  Minorities and women
              will be particularly targeted for  recruitment nationwide, through cooperation
              with agencies  involved in increasing their participation in scientific 
              research.  Research results will be presented by  participants, and prepared
              for publication the "on-line"  program evaluation strategy developed during the
              previous  funding period will be expanded, with particular emphasis  placed on
              determining how the individual student's needs  were met in terms of
              establishing and fostering their desire  to pursue a research career.
