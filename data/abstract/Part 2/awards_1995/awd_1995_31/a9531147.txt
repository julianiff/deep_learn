Abstract    :
              The Mexico Political Reform of 1977 was initiated to revitalize the electoral
              process and re-legitimize the government party and national political
              institutions.  During the previous decade, Mexican politics had become
              increasingly violent as opposition increased and groups moved outside the
              political arena to affect change on the system.  The 1977 Reform was designed
              to increase incentives for critics to work within the political system by
              changing procedures for political party recognition, enlarging the national
              legislature, and establishing a two-tiered electoral system with partial
              proportional representation.   By all reports the reforms enacted were
              successful in changing the electoral process.  But little is known about the
              impact of the reforms on the operation of the national Chamber of Deputies
              which has absorbed the new opposition political parties.  This research
              examines how the reforms of 1977 has influenced the path of Mexican democratic
              government.  Based on a pre and post-reform research design, legislative rules
              and well as legislative business (in the form of bill introduction, amendment
              and passage) will be collected for the period 1970-1993.  The results of this
              research will demonstrate the utility of the "new institutionalism" perspective
              for explaining legislatures outside the United States and Europe.  * * *
