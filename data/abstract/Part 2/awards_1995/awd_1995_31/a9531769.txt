Abstract    :
                   DMS-9531769  Vishik    The PI will investigate the mathematical problems of
              fluid motion.   Methods of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations
              will   be used to study the evolution of singularities and loss of smoothness  
              for the incompressible flows of an ideal fluid. The typical vorticity   field
              admissible for the analysis is not essentially bounded although the  set where
              it blows up is in some sense small. The  proposed  study   will provide precise
              information about the separation of Lagrangian   trajectories of liquid
              particles and generation of small scale structures  by the flow. The PI in
              collaboration with S.Friedlander  will continue to   investigate nonlinear
              instability and spectrum of small oscillations of an  ideal fluid about a given
              equilibrium using methods of dynamical systems  and spectral theory.   %%%     
                 Mathematical theory of fluid motion is aimed at understanding phenomena  in
              fluids, such as turbulence, from the basic equations. This subject is 
              fundamental for applications in meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics,  
              oceanology, and aerodynamics.In the past, the partial differential   equations
              of fluid motion have been a source of several important concepts   in
              mathematics. The proposed research will address two problems. First,   one
              particular scenario of the evolution of fluid flow when mild   singularities
              are present in the velocity field, will be investigated.   Such flows of an
              ideal fluid may approximate viscous flows at very high   Reynolds number. The
              second line of research is hydrodynamic stability   theory.Its goal is to
              understand the general conditions for the parameters   and geometry of the flow
              under which fluid loses stability and to describe   frequencies of small
              oscillations when the flow is not too far from the   steady state.   ***
