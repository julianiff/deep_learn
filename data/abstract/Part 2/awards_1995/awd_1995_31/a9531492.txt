Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    EEC-9531731  Murphy    The purpose of this REU site is to expose
              students to a variety of bioprocessing research projects and to motivate these
              students to pursue graduate study and careers in bioprocessing research and
              development.  The REU program will be conducted within the Colorado
              Bioprocessing Center (CBC) at Colorado State University which has a full
              spectrum of bioprocess equipment at both bench and pilot scales for
              fermentation, cell culture and product recovery research.  Students selected
              for participation in the program will first be exposed to a series of lectures
              conducted by CBC faculty on the fundamentals of biochemical engineering.  This
              will be followed by hand-on experience with the process and analytical
              equipment in the CBC and the development and execution of a focused research
              project under the guidance and support of CBC researchers.  Up to ten (10) are
              expected to participate in this program annually.
