Abstract    :
              9531873    Rothstein    This project is a contribution to the modeling component
              to be   carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate  
              Experiment (ACCE) under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment   (WOCE).  The
              focus will be on upgrading existing isopycnal models,   data assimilation, and
              integrating different types of regional   models.  Comparisons will be made
              among different modeling approaches   in order to assess the strngths and
              weaknesses of each, and to   determine the best overall approach for including
              ocean variability   in climate modeling.  Particular attention will be paid to 
               assimilating, into the models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as   well as
              from historical data bases.  In this particular project, the   PIs will provide
              a numerical ocean circulation context for the   dynamical analyses of the
              subpolar field observations, using the   Princeton Ocean Model (POM), recently
              re-designed to properly   represent all of the important subpolar physical
              process.  It will be   further augmented with an atmospheric boundary layer
              model to more   accurately represent surface heat fluxes, and an ice model to  
              properly simulate regional fresh water fluxes.
