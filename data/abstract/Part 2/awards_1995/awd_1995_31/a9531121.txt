Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Massachusetts will support   the
              research of Professor Ricardo B. Metz.  The research focusses on   spectroscopy
              and photofragmentation dynamics of transition metal   cation-organic molecule
              complexes.  Gas-phase transition metal cations   are powerful catalysts, able
              to activate carbon-hydrogen and   carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes at room
              temperature.  Very little is known   about the adduct, a metal cation-organic
              molecule complex.  The present   research uses a dual time-of-flight
              photofragment spectrometer to   characterize the adducts, determining the
              thermochemistry and bonding of   the ground and low-lying excited electronic
              states.  The information is   then used to control reaction pathways in the
              adduct.  This research will contribute fundamental insights into gas-phase
              metal    ion chemistry toward the goal of enabling design of more effective  
              heterogeneous catalysts.
