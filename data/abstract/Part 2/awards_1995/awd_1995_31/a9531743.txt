Abstract    :
              9531743  Bonnell      This  research project seeks to understand the effects  of
               local variations in chemically graded Cr-oxycarbonitride  films on film
              properties.  This grant, which is supported  under the GOALI initiative, is a
              collaborative effort  between researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and
               DuPont.  It is planned to use precise and well characterized  variations in
              sample composition to  correlate electronic  structure, charge density,
              dielectric properties, and  optical properties.  The principal experimental
              research  tools proposed are scanning tunneling and optical  spectroscopies
              along with  more standard characterization  methods (SIMS, RBS, EDS, etc.).  A
              major goal of the project  is to achieve sufficient fundamental knowledge to
              develop a  model relating local bonding to properties in multicomponent 
              systems.  %%%  An  important feature of the program is the integration of 
              research and education by provision of an invaluable  opportunity for students
              to conduct fundamental materials  science research in both University and 
              Industrial research  environments.  The students will receive joint mentoring
              by  Prof.Bonnell/University of  Pennsylvania, and Dr.  French/DuPont.  A
              computer network connection will be  established to allow experimental data and
              modeling at  either location to be accessed at the other; the network  will
              also include a bulletin board for information exchange.  The project represents
              a strong research alliance between  academia and industry, and at the same time
              provides an  attractive arrangement for integration of education and  research
              through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically
              significant area.  ***
