Abstract    :
              9531182  Chung  Present theory is based on incorporating a new concept of 
              vertical pipe connecting to a miner and application of  external (control)
              force on the pipe for the control of pipe-  miner motions.    Modeling of an
              entire pipe-miner system pin-joins a  horizontal pipe to the long,
              near-vertical pipe system and  to a self-propelling seafloor miner.  The
              elastic joints  along the pipe can be made effective in changing the axial,  as
              well as, bending characteristics.  To apply external  (control) forces to the
              joints for the control of the  lateral motion of the pipe, the flexible joints
              will be  modeled by finite element (FEM), as well as combined (rigid  body)
              element (RBE).  The accuracy and advantages of the two  methods will be
              compared.  The pin joint leads the entire  system to zero eigenvalue and rigid
              mode, and the weight, as  the inner axial force of the vertical pipe, further 
              influences the eigenvalues of the entire system.  A shift  technique will solve
              this problem.  The proposed 3-D  nonlinear coupled responses with nonlinear
              axial dampers  installed at the joints will reduce the axial stress and  also
              influence the bending and torsion, as well.  Soil  (sediment) resistance for
              the miner will be modeled by both  DEM (discrete elements) and FEM.  The DEM
              modeling will use  a mass of discrete particles of general geometry. 
              Preliminary modeling of soil particles indicates that DEM  modeling is very
              promising to examine micromechanical  details of the soil particles.  ***
