Abstract    :
              Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on nonlinear   dynamics in
              chemical systems.  The research involves studies of complex   chemical dynamics
              in continuously stirred reactors, in homogeneous and   unstirred systems, and
              distributed chemical systems.  Three main lines of   research are proposed: 1)
              developing techniques to control chaos using   linear and nonlinear control
              methods; 2) studies of chemical waves in   inhomogeneous and perturbed
              excitable media; and 3) studies of   instabilities in propagating
              reaction-diffusion fronts.  Both   experimental and theoretical studies will be
              performed.  One novel   experimental project being explored by Showalter is the
              use of an ink jet   printer to prepare patterns of immobilized catalyst for
              excitable   chemical systems.  This enables him to study chemical wave behavior
              in   the presence of systematically designed geometric constraints which are  
              models for excitable biological media such as the heart muscle.  Nonlinear
              dynamics is a powerful tool for understanding complexity in   nature, and it
              has many practical applications.  Biological applications   include stabilizing
              periodic rhythms in heart tissue and inducing   periodic and chaotic behavior
              in hippocampal brain tissue.  Major   successes can also be found in
              applications of the principles of   excitable media to cardiology, which have
              led to an understanding of the   role spiral waves play in heart maladies such
              as tachycardia and   fibrillation.  Showalter's research provides a fundamental
              chemical   understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings for these important  
              biological phenomena.
