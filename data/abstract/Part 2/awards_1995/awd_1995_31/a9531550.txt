Abstract    :
                         This award will provide opportunities for 16 undergraduate  students
              each summer to participate in the Research Experiences  in Molecular Biology
              program at the University of Minnesota.  This program has two parts.  First all
              students spend three weeks  learning basic molecular biology techniques in an
              intensive  laboratory course.  This course will cover basic principles of  gene
              regulation and will provide students with the most current  information on
              specific techniques as well as background  terminology and concepts.  Following
              the course, each student  spends the next seven weeks completing an independent
              research  project under the direction of one of the 50 faculty mentors 
              affiliated with the program, all of whom are conducting research  using
              Recombinant DNA technology.  The students' research  experience will be
              supplemented by weekly student seminars and  evening workshops to strengthen
              the quality of future  applications to graduate programs.  Students will
              prepare a  summary of their research project in the form of a display or a 
              poster session at the conclusion of the program.       This award will foster
              the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of our
              next generation of basic  researchers in the biological sciences.
