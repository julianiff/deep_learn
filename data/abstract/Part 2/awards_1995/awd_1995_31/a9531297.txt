Abstract    :
              9531297  Wenger  This  project  will  integrate research and education  through 
              a  program  of  activities aimed at developing and  enabling  a  new 
              generational  cohort  of  social  science  researchers  who  will  investigate 
               various  aspects  of  hazards  and  disasters.    A  comprehensive  and 
              creative  program  for  mentoring   recently-  appointed  junior  faculty  at 
              research  universities  will   be  established.   The  format  is  to  bring 
              promising  and   newly  appointed faculty members into sustained contact over a
               one-year  period with seasoned researchers from several universities.   The 
              effort will be organized around a faculty panel consisting of six  persons  
              with  strong  research  and  publication   records   in  economics, geography,
              planning, political science, psychology and  sociology.  The panel will engage
              in mentoring 12 junior  faculty  who  will  be  competitively selected as 
              fellows.  The  two-year  program will involve detailed planning, a set of
              workshops,  one-  on-one mentoring, and research and writing activities.  ***
