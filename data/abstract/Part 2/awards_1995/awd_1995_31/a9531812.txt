              ABSTRACT       The project is and attempt to combine ion-pair extraction with
              adsorption as a means to lower the costs of recovering polar organics form
              aqueous solution.  Separation selectivities may be improved significantly be y
              exploiting specific interaction mechanisms and coupling multiple interactions. 
              The proposed work involves the use of quaternary ammonium extractants for the
              ion-pair extraction of organic acids, and combing of ion-pair extraction with
              adsorption onto the polar sites of an acrylic ester sorbent.  The hydrophobic
              and electrostatic interactions associated with ion-pair extraction will be
              coupled to polar adsorptive interactions.  The goals are to quantify the role
              of each interaction mechanism and to assess the separations potential of
              coupling interactions for model systems.  Enhancing product purity, minimizing
              waste and increasing energy efficiency provide strong motivation for this
              project.  The results may lead to improved separation techniques for
              manufacturing commodity chemicals and biomolecules.
