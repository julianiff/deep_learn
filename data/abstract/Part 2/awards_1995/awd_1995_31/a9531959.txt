Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9531959  C.F. Zukoski, U. of Illinois at Urbana    The effect of
              particle interactions on compressible consolidation processes and deformable
              particle bed/suspension rheology will be investigated.  Interparticle normal
              and lateral (frictional) forces at distances of 1 to 20 nm will be measured
              with an atomic force microscopy, and the interparticle electrostatic potentials
              will be evaluated using static light scattering on model colloidal suspensions.
               The particulate structure during experiments will be determined by sectioning
              the consolidated beds and determining of planar volume fraction, as well as by
              using small angle neutron scattering, and optical visualization.  A
              compressible constitutive model will be developed using the understanding of 
              bed/suspension mechanics at microscopic level.    The project has relevance to
              the theory of compressible constitutive relationships of deformable particulate
              systems, with application to bed/suspension mechanics, filtration, soil
              liquefaction, ceramics fabrication and various chemical processes.     ***
