Abstract    :
              A summer research program in Physics and Astronomy at the  University of
              Oklahoma will provide undergraduates with an  opportunity to materially
              participate in scientific  research.  Ten external students will be funded by
              the REU  site grant and at least five internal students will be  funded by a
              variety of sources within the University.  A  biweekly seminar series with
              strong emphasis on student  participation and interaction with faculty and
              graduate  students will enable the participants to gain the most  benefit from
              their research experience.  A distinguishing  feature of the program will be
              the exposure of all student  participants to both theoretical and experimental
              research  in four distinct but well focused areas: astrophysics,  atomic and
              molecular; condensed matter, and particle  physics.  External students will be
              recruited nationally and  regionally with emphasis on underrepresented groups
              and  participants who otherwise lack opportunities for research  experience. 
              The goal of the program is to encourage and  prepare students to seek further
              educational and career  opportunities in physics and astronomy.
