Abstract    :
              The PI will build on previous work improving the understanding of the role of
              photospheric magnetic activity in determining solar irradiance variation.  The
              main objectives are:  (1) improving empirical models of variations in total
              irradiance using the digital, full-disc CaK images produced from the Mount
              Wilson daily spectroheliograms obtained between 1915 and 1985; (2) using these
              digital CaK data to produce the first empirical models of long-term solar
              spectral irradiance variations in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet,
              extending back to 1915;  (3) extending digitization of the Mount Wilson data to
              include plates of different format obtained between 1905 and 1915; and (4)
              extending previous study of the behavior of plages and spots at times of
              highest solar activity.
