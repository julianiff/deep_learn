Abstract    :
              9531745  Wobbe  Turnip crinkle virus, a plant pathogen, has been shown to
              require two small proteins for movement and systemic infection in plants.
              Characterization of the proteins will be continued by site-directed mutagensis
              coupled with functional characterization of such mutants. Deletion analysis
              will be used to determine regions of the protein which are necessary for
              nucleic acid binding and cooperatively. An attempt will be made to separate the
              two functional domains. Work will also continue with the TCV mutant which does
              not induce the hypersensitive response in certain plants although it replicates
              and spreads as does wildtype.    %%%  Plant viruses are among the best defined
              plant pathogens; they have small genomes and are easily genetically
              manipulated. The question of how they move through the  plant  in the course of
              systemic infection is important to understand and this work should add to our
              knowledge of that process.  ***
