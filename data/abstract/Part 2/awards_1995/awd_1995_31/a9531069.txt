Abstract    :
              9531069  Cooper  This project proposes to investigate the solution of ion 
              containing polymers.  The following issues will be  addressed:  1)  Static
              Properties of Ionomer Solutions.  Viscometric, light scattering, SAXS, and SANS
              experiments on  model telechelic ionomers will be used to study interchain 
              association and to determine the structure and  thermodynamics of low polarity
              associating ionomer solutions  over a broad concentration regime.  2)  Dynamic
              Properties  of Ionomer Solutions.  The effect of deformation on the  structure
              and chain stretching of model telechelic and  polyurethane ionomers will be
              determined.  Particular  attention will be paid to determining the molecular
              factors  governing shear thickening and shear thinning phenomena in 
              associating ionomer solutions.  %%%  The overall research findings resulting
              from this  investigation should be useful in defining more predictable 
              processing conditions for this important class of polymer.  These materials
              find applications as membranes, adhesives,  coatings, viscosity modifiers, and
              packaging mateials; all  of which are sensitive to the material processing
              history.   ***
