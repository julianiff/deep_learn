Abstract    :
              Deser    9531870    As part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment 
              (ACCE) of the  World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Program, an  analysis
              of  historical data will be combined with atmospheric and ocean  mixed layer 
              modeling experiments to investigate large scale air-sea  interactions in the 
              North Atlantic. Of particular interest to this study are the  processes that 
              contribute to Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly  development in the 
              sub-polar and sub-tropical gyres, with emphasis upon the  relative roles of 
              air-sea fluxes and entrainment of subsurface water into the  mixed layer. The 
              temporal evolution and sub-surface thermal expression of the  quasi-decadal 
              SST variations in the sub-polar gyre and the time-dependent  atmospheric 
              response to SST anomalies will be studied to provide an  historical context 
              for the atmospheric and oceanic variability observed during  the field phase 
              of ACCE.
