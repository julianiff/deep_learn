Abstract    :
              9531430  Mermin  This grant continues on the well recognized work of the PI  on
              the generalization of  symmetry classification (of  periodic crystals) to
              include aperiodic crystals.  Some  specific items include the case of tensorial
              order  parameter, symmetry changes at commensurate-incommensurate  phase
              transition and the newly discovered tetrahedral  quasicrystals.  In addition,
              there are questions of the  relationship between the recent work in the
              mathematical  literature by Novikov, Piunikhin and Conway and the PI's 
              classification scheme.  %%%  Until the discovery of quasicrystals in the early
              eighties,  the scientific view of a periodic crystal had been well  established
              for more than 100 years and had been described  in the textbooks.  The
              aperiodic or quasiperiodic structures  challenged that framework and, in a
              seminal work by the PI,  the symmetry classification has been generalized to
              include  the new developments.  The present grant further explores  ways of
              enriching the new classification scheme.  There are  also plans to study and
              establish relationships with the  work of others.  ***
