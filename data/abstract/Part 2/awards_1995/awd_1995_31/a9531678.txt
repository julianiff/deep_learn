Abstract    :
              ***  9531678  Stark    This action is to support a Workshop on the
              Post-Liquefaction Behavior of Soils, to be held in April, 1997 on the campus of
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.    Approximately 20 experts in
              the fields of soil liquefaction, granular fluid flow, seismic slope stability,
              and the seismically-induced permanent deformations of soils will be invited to
              participate, representing industry, government, and academia, and providing a
              broad range of background and perspective on the problems to be discussed.   
              The workshop will evaluate the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice of
              the post-liquefaction behavior of soils; provide recommendations for use of the
              post-liquefaction shear strength in stability and deformation analyses; and
              identify and prioritize research needs for the future.    A report presenting
              the Executive Summary, Findings, Recommendations and Conclusions of the
              Workshop will be available for electronic transmission in the ASCII file
              format, and will also be posted on the World Wide Web.***
