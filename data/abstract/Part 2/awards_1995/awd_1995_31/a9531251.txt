Abstract    :
              9531251  Spigelman    One of the parts of the brain important for learning in
              mammals is  called the hippocampus, lying deep beneath the cererbral 
              hemispheres.  The hippocampus contains a curled formation called  the dentate
              gyrus, which has three layers of nerve cells, or  neurons.   These neurons have
              characteristic shapes and some of  their connections are known to form
              particular local circuits.  The  basket cells, granule cells, mossy cells and
              mossy fibers form  circuits that are believed to underlie the functions of
              spatial  learning.  The postnatal development of the functional connections 
              within these circuits are important to know if we are to understand  the role
              of the hippocampus in early learning.  This collaborative  work by an electron
              microscopist and a neurophysiologist examines  the ultrastructure of synapses
              (the functional cellular  connections) between particular classes of neurons
              and the membrane  properties of those neurons.  Documenting changes in these 
              structural and functional features during development will allow a  better
              understanding of how the hippocampus begins to function  during early learning.
               The results will be important not only for  understanding brain development,
              but also for psychological studies  on learning.
