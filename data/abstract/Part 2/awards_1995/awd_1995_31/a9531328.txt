Abstract    :
              9531328  Adams   This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
              researchers in   mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty
              advisors. Areas of possible   research include knot theory, diophantine
              approximation, geodesic nets, and symbolic   dynamics. The program will run for
              eight weeks. Students each give a presentation of their   work during the
              summer. At the end of the program, the students will prepare their work   for
              possible publication.
