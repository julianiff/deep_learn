Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9531933    Principal Investigator:  Robert Peale/University
              of Central Florida    Title:  Mode-locked high power semiconductor FIR/sub-mm
              laser    Abstract    This research will develop a mode-locked high power
              semiconductor FIR/sub-mm laser, using p-Ge.  The p-Ge laser is tunable for 70
              to 200 mm where no other solid state laser is known.  A clearer understanding
              of the carrier dynamics responsible for lasing will emerge via new experimental
              tests, especially a new and unusual temperature effect and the connection
              between cooling rate and emission dynamics.  Development of a practical
              table-top high power laser in this source-poor region will have important
              ramifications for advancement in many fields, such as molecular and solid state
              spectroscopy, remote sensing and plasma diagnostics.  High tunable tunable
              sources, other than FELS are especially lacking.  Development of this laser as
              a compact source, made possible by replacing superconducting magnets with
              permanent magnets, is also important for practical applications.
