Abstract    :
                Abstract    9531541  James    The Department of Mechanical Engineering at
              Colorado State University will conduct an REU Site summer program for 8-12
              students annually.  Some of the research projects include:  1.) Polymeric
              materials for orthopaedic implants, 2.) Analysis of retrieved orthopaedic
              implants, 3.) Modeling of spray combustion, 4.) Stability of failing films, 5.)
              Manufacturing monitoring and 6.)  Composite materials.
