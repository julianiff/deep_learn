Abstract    :
              ***  9531896  Hatley   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project 
               is to design and prototype a dexterous robotic manipulator for   applications
              such as minimally invasive surgery. The robotic   manipulator will provide
              surgeons with a new and more dexterous   tool for performing diagnostic and
              therapeutic procedures.   The project has potential in a wide variety of
              commercial   applications but especially in minimally invasive surgery,
              including   suturing, dissection and retraction, in procedures such as removal
              of   gall bladder and bowel resection.  ***
