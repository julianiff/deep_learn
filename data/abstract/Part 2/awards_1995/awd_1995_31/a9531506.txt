Abstract    :
              Abstract    9531506  Magnusson    The University of Texas at Arlington has an
              academic year component and a summer session component.  The academic year
              components is open to all junior year electrical engineering students and the
              summer session focuses on recruiting underrrepresented students from nearby
              undergraduate colleges and universities.  Example research projects are:  1.) 
              Theory and Application of Microwave Backscattering, 2.) Practical Optical
              Waveguide Grating Fabrication, 3.) Applications and Implication of Virtual
              Reality, 4.)Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks, and 5.)  Measurements for
              Automated Surfaces Finishing.
