Abstract    :
                      A multidisciplinary study of the Strand Fiord and related volcanics is
              planned to address several questions of Arctic tectonic evolution and global
              change, taking advantage of the exposed sections to obtain high-latitude
              paleomagnetic data. The following five questions will be addressed through the
              collection of new paleomagnetic, radiometric and geochemical data:     (1) What
              is the exact age and duration of the Strand Fiord volcanics,  and do these
              flood basalt correlate, as do others (Deccan and  Siberian Traps), with a
              global extinction event?   (2) What is the relationship between the Strand
              Fiord volcanics and  the older Isachesen volcanics, and can any of these units
              be used  to constrain the geomagnetic timescale?  (3) What  is the relationship
              between these volcanics and mantle  plumes such as Iceland,and a larger scale
              activity such as the  "superplume"?  (4) Can a paleomagnetic record from the
              Strand Fiord volcanics answer  the Nares Strait  problem?  (5) Can the Strand
              Fiord volcanics provide geomagnetic paleointensity  information for the
              Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron?    The study of these geological and
              geophysical questions is linked through a common sampling scheme: the
              flow-by-flow sampling of long, continuous volcanic sections for paleomagnetic
              and geochemical analyses.
