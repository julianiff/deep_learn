Abstract    :
              9531885    Firing    This project is a component of a multi-investigator study
              of the Sub Polar   Gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean to be carried out as part
              of the WOCE ACCE   (Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment of the World
              Ocean Circulation   Experiment).  The PIs will participate at least two
              hydrographic cruises,   providing support to obtain direct measurements of
              velocity, using a shipboard   ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler), as well
              as a Lowered ADCP (LADCP).    The data will be used to investigate the upper
              ocean mass, heat, salt and   momentum balance in the subpolar gyre during both
              fall and spring seasons.
