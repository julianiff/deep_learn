Abstract    :
              9531115  Zangwill  The magnetic properties of ultra-thin (< 5 monolayers) films 
              are likely to be strongly affected by the surface roughness.  The step edges of
              a rough film are sites of reduced symmetry  and the magnetic moments located at
              these sites must  experience different exchange constants as well as different 
              anisotropy fields.  The principal objective in this grant is  to develop a
              consistent theory of magnetic hysteresis that  connects the structure and
              morphology of these materials to  their coercivity and remanence  The program
              calls for  extensive numerical calculations augmented by analytic and 
              numerical analysis of toy models and continuum equations  suggested by the
              simulations. The calculations offer direct  evaluation of various
              experimentally measurable quantities  and thus afford comparison with the
              experiments.  %%%  Magnetic thin films are used in  a variety of applications, 
              the most well known being in memory devices.   This grant is  comprehensive
              program of  theoretical research to study the  magnetic properties of realistic
              thin films i.e. the program  incorporates the structural and morphological
              effects (of  surface roughness) in an essential way.  ***
