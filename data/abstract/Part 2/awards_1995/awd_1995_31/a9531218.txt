Abstract    :
              9531218  Carmichael       Theoretical research on the quantum dynamics of small 
              collections of atoms interacting with photons is proposed using a  number of
              theoretical/computational approaches.  Two principal  physical systems will be
              studied.  The first involves two state  atoms in a high finesse optical cavity
              with the objective of  understanding entangled atom/photon states.  The second 
              concentrates on the photon statistics of microcavity lasers with  the objective
              of understanding the optical spectrum of these  systems and how they differ
              from conventional lasers.  ***
