Abstract    :
                  9531719  Lin  Engineering structures are often exposed to dynamic random 
              excitations which can only be described in terms of probability and 
              statistics.  Examples of such excitations include seismic ground 
              accelerations, turbulent winds, ocean waves, and traffic loads.  It  has also
              been well recognized that most structures need not be or  should not be
              designed for eternal life; otherwise, the required  size may be too large to be
              practical, or the cost too high.  Thus  the possibility of large deformation
              and failure must be considered  in the design.  The choice must then be made
              for the optimal total  cost within a desired minimum service life of a
              structural system,  including the costs of initial construction, maintenance
              and  repair, costs associated with interruption of service, etc.     The
              problem of a randomly excited structures undergoing large  deformation is a
              difficult one, since nonlinear behaviors of the  structure must be taken into
              account.  For nonlinear structures,  known exact analytical solutions are, by
              an large restricted to the  case of single degree of freedom under white noise
              excitations.  Extension to the case of multiple degrees of freedom is
              successful  only under additional severe restrictions.      The PI plans to
              develop new advanced analytical techniques to  obtain the response statistics
              and probability of failure for  multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear structural
              systems under random  dynamical excitations.  Both geometrical and material 
              nonlinearities will be considered.
