Abstract    :
                Abstract      9531708  Tansel    The REU Site at Florida International
              University is designed to stimulate and promote interest curiosity, creative
              and critical thinking of undergraduate students in environmental science and
              engineering.  The research projects will involve movement and dispersion of
              contaminants and treatment of contaminated media (air, water and soil) to
              minimize potential damage to the environment.  The REU Site program is designed
              as a collaborative effort with the university research faculty and local
              environmental agencies to engage students in the different areas of
              environmental engineering.  Students will work in interactive research teams. 
              The research experience will also include environmental ethics.
