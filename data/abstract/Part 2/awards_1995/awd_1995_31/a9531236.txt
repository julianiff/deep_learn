Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, uses electrospray and matrix assisted laser  desorption ionization
              (MALDI) source Fourier Transform Mass  Spectrometry (FTMS) to investigate the
              structure of gas phase  macromolecular complexes.  Hydrogen-deuterium exchange,
              coupled  with deprotonation reactions, provides structural information about 
              large peptide and protein complexes.  Lysozyme-oligosaccharide  complexes will
              be examined, and general methods for the structural  elucidation of complex
              biological molecules using mass spectrometry  will be developed.  Systematic,
              quantitative studies of non-  covalent bonding in these gas phase complexes
              will be carried out.  The structural characterization of large biological
              molecules,  including drug-protein complexes and macromolecular species of 
              interest to biology, is essential for the understanding of life  processes. 
              Mass spectrometric approaches to the solution of these  structural problems is
              the focus of this research project.  The use  of isotopic exchange and
              deprotonation reactions provides a non-  destructive structural probe in this
              effort.  The results of this  research project will have immediate  application
              in the structural  analysis of many important biological systems.
