Abstract    :
              INT 9531458  Gerber      This U.S.-Czech research project between R. Benny
              Gerber of the University of California, Irvine, and Pavel Jungwirth of the
              Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry, Prague, will examine the chemical
              dynamics of many-body systems for the purpose of characterizing systems such as
              those in van der Walls and hydrogen bonded clusters.  The intent is to employ
              the strengths in quantum dynamics of the U.S. participants and those of the
              Prague group in electronic structure calculations to study three specific
              topics: 1) Spectroscopy and dynamics of photodissociation, quenching and
              recombination of iodine embedded in large argon clusters; 2) the dynamics of a
              chlorine atom in water following electron photodetachment from hydrated
              chloride ions; and 3) Raman spectra and hydrogen atom dynamics in photoexcited
              hydrogen bonded clusters.  Results are expected to contribute to our basic
              knowledge of molecular clusters and related condensed phase phenomena.    This
              project in theoretical physical chemistry fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
              and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
              in areas of mutual interest and competence.    ??
