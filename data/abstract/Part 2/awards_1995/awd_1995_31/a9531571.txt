              Urbana-Champaign    REU:  Undergraduate Symbolic Computations in Engineering
              and Science (USCES)    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project
              will support ten students per year in programs carried out during the summer,
              for three years.  The project will promote the emerging field of symbolic
              computational science as an approach to computational modeling and scientific
              computing with problems drawn primarily from mechanical and industrial
              engineering.  Specific goals of the project are (a) to introduce the students
              to modern computational and symbolic methodologies for solving challenging
              problems, (b) to increase understanding of the qualitative and quantitative
              nature of these problems, (c) to develop the students' ability to derive and
              interpret mathematical models, and (d) to provide an integrated educational
              experience to a selected group of undergraduate students with special emphasis
              on underrepresented groups.  Members of the research team are from `oth the
              University of Illinois and from Wolfram Research and use of the symbolic
              manipulation package Mathematica will be a focus of the effort.  ***
