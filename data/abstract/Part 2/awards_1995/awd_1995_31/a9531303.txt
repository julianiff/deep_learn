Abstract    :
              ***  9531303  Scheer  This NSF Phase II SBIR will produce an inexpensive, direct
              reading sensor, capable of real time measurement of bacterial contamination in
              sensitive areas, such as food and pharmaceutical facilities and water treatment
              plants. During phase I of this project the proposer demonstrated the
              feasibility of detecting ATP in quantities as small as 10-9 g (2x10-12 moles)
              both visually and on photographic film. The technology employs the firefly
              luciferase catalyzed light producing reaction between luciferin and ATP. By
              mediating the ATP concentration with the "ATPase" apyrase, the proposer is able
              to produce a spatial light pattern which indicates the concentration of ATP
              present in a sample. In this project the proposer will focus on increasing the
              sensitivity of our direct reading ATP sensor to levels more suited to bacterial
              detection (10-12 to 10-13 g). This increase in sensitivity will be achieved by
              three primary means: 1) increasing the intensity and/or duration of the
              luminescence for a given quantity of ATP, 2) increasing the amount of light
              that reaches the detector (film or otherwise), and 3) optimizing the
              non-instrumented detector for the system. Each of these objectives should
              contribute at least one order of magnitude increase in absolute ATP
              sensitivity.  Rapid, simple, inexpensive and reliable measurement of bacterial
              contamination will facilitate industrial compliance with safe food and dairy
              practices. The sensors can also be applied to a range of medical and
              pharmaceutical environments and products. Eventually, marketing efforts will
              lead to consumer use in the home for the sanitary monitoring of kitchen and
              bathroom surfaces.  ***
