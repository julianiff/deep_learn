Abstract    :
              9531884    Weiss    In this project the PI will participate in the Spring, 1997 
              hydrographic survey as part of the Atlantic Circulation and  Climate Experiment
              (ACCE), a U.S. contribution to the  International World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE).  The  survey will cover the central/eastern basin of the sub
              polar gyre  in the North Atlantic between Greenland and the Azores. 
              Specifically, the PI will provide support to collect and analyze  water samples
              for their content of  oceanic chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tracers F-11, F-12, and
              F-113 in  order to use them to study water mass formation and circulation. 
              Specific studies include identification of location and depths of  wintertime
              convection , and characterization of the rates and  pathways for the
              communication of surface water into the deep  circulation.  The time scales of
              CFC decay complement those of  Helium-3 and Tritium in providing firmer
              constraints on these  processes in models of the North Atlantic circulation.
