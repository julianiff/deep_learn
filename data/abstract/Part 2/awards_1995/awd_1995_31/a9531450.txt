Abstract    :
                    A technique for direct, in-situ measurement of the stress tensor in deep
              glacier ice will be developed by adapting methods presently in use in rock
              mechanics for the measurement of in-situ stress in visco-elastic/plastic
              materials.  Direct  stress and deformation measurements will be combined.  This
              will provide two critical properties near the bed of a glacier experiencing
              fairly complex sliding behavior.  For the first time, independent observations
              of the full stress tensor and the full strain rate tensor in glacier ice will
              be obtained.    The determination of the spatial and temporal character of
              coupling between glacier ice and the glacier bed is necessary for understanding
              the dynamics of virtually all ice masses of current interest.  Variations in
              basal and marginal tractions are critical controlling factors in polar ice
              streams, calving and surging glaciers. The behavior of ice sheets, as well as
              the stratigraphic interpretation of cores taken from ice sheets, depend on an
              understanding of the patterns of coupling at the bed and the velocity fields
              that arise in the ice as a consequence.
