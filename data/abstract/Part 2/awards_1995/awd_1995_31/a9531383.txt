Abstract    :
              The University of Notre Dame Physics REU-REU summer research  program will be
              continued from 1996 through the year 2000.  The Notre Dame summer research
              program will continue to  place a strong emphasis on not only the research
              development  of each student in a particular project, but will also  expose the
              participating students to the numerous  opportunities available in a variety of
              physics research  areas.  Each of the undergraduate physics majors admitted to 
              the program (averaging 18 students for the last three years)  will participate
              in an ongoing and active research program  and will be encouraged to become
              involved colleagues in the  everyday problem solving events.  The participating
              Notre  Dame physics research groups are diverse -- atomic, nuclear 
              astrophysics, high energy, solid state and microelectronics,  biophysics, and
              theory.  Most of the recruitment efforts are  in undergraduate colleges and
              universities in the midwestern  region.
