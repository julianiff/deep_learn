Abstract    :
              9431954  POPESCU    This proposal considers some problems in ``Noncommutative
              harmonic analysis and  operator algebras''. The framework of this proposal is
              mainly the C*-algebra (resp. non-self-adjoint algebra) generated by a class of
              semigroups of isometries on Hilbert spaces. Noncommutative Poisson transforms,
              Wold-type decompositions, positive-definite functions on semigroups, and
              isometric dilations are considered to study these algebras and their
              representations. The proposer expects to find noncommutative analogs to some
              classical results. The main directions of this proposed research are the
              following:    1. Poisson transforms on some C*-algebras generated by
              isometries.    2. Joint dilations and universal operator algebras.    3.
              Positive-definite functions on semigroups and isometric representations.    4.
              Noncommutative analog of the Hardy space of bounded analytic functions on    
              the unit disk.    The motivation of this research is the recent worldwide
              interest in the noncommutative aspect of harmonic analysis originated from the
              concept of quantization which links together several branches of mathematics
              and is closely  related to mathematical physics. The objective of this research
              is to advance the understanding of this relatively new area of mathematics and
              to apply some of these results to noncommutative probability theory,
              interpolation theory, and  model theory.
