Abstract    :
              9531721  Ramesh       The PI proposes an integrated solution to the problem of 
              dispatching electric power in the most economical manner while  meeting
              security and environmental constraints, where the term  security refers to the
              ability of the power network to sustain  normal operations in the event of
              contingencies.  This problem,  which is referred to in the proposal as the
              SECOPE problem, is an  extension of the On-line Optimal Power Flow problem. 
              The primary  objectives of the research are: 1) to find a decomposition for 
              the SECOPE problem that explicitly models the uncertainties in  the input data,
              and that filters and prioritizes suggested  control actions; 2) to determine an
              appropriate global  optimization technique for solving the above decomposition
              with  the addition of discrete control actions; and, 3) to study the 
              convergence characteristics of the synchronous and asynchronous  parallel
              implementations of this decomposition for realistic  power systems.  The
              primary objectives of the proposed education  activities are: 1) to use the
              multimedia resources of the  Internet and the World Wide Web to teach students
              to "learn to  learn",  2) to motivate students (especially undergraduates) to 
              pursue a career in power engineering.   ***
