Abstract    :
              9531794  Luby  This project funds speaker and participant costs for a workshop, 
              titled ``Randomized Algorithms and Computation'', at ICSI,  December 17 -- 22,
              1995.   The Workshop emphasizes applications  to approximation algorithms for
              optimization and counting  problems, coding theory with network and multimedia
              applications,  cryptography and security, distributed computation, and 
              derandomization of algorithms.    The Workshop:            (1) Brings together
              leading researchers from Europe,  Israel, Canada and the U.S.;          (2) Is
              being combined with the Weizmann Institute  Workshop on ``Randomness and
              Computation'' (normally  held in Israel in January);          (3) Is organized
              in cooperation with the ESPIRT RAND  Working Group.    This project is a
              cooperative funding effort with support for  European participants provided by
              the ESPRIT RAND-REC Project.  ***
