Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Furman University for an REU Site which offers
              students research experiences in psychology.  Eight students each year, over a
              three year period, will be selected for ten-week sessions in the summer.  The
              focus of the research program is information processing.  Students will pursue
              research in the areas of learning, memory, and cognition.  Five faculty
              directors representing distinct perspectives in psychology (biological,
              comparative, cognitive, developmental, and social) will collaborate with the
              students.  Each student will be responsible for a specific, unique research
              project.  Project activities will insure that each student conducts meaningful
              research and learns not just about his or her own project, but also about the
              integrated nature of behavioral science.  The interdisciplinary nature of
              research will be a focus of the Site.  Other activities will include
              instruction on computer skills and data analysis, written and oral
              presentations, and weekly group meetings to present issues and help students
              appreciate the interrelationship of the various projects..  This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
              into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
