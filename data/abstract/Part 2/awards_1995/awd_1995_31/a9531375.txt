Abstract    :
              Abstract:  The Center for High-Pressure Research (CHiPR) at SUNY Stony Brook
              will establish a Summer program to give undergraduates the opportunity to
              participate in the excitement of a premier science laboratory.  The goal is to
              recruit students from the physical sciences and stimulate them to pursue a
              research career in the Earth Sciences.  Students will work with faculty of the
              Mineral Physics Institute (MPI) on projects that probe the physical and
              chemical properties of materials, with a particular emphasis on use of high
              pressure.  Working closely with members of the MPI, students will pursue their
              own projects and discuss their progress during weekly seminars.  During the
              program, students will visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated
              with the MPI.  CHiPR has established a good record of recruiting and retaining
              minority students by relying on personal contacts, especially with faculty at
              historically minority colleges and universities.  The best example of this is
              recruiting by a black faculty member at an historically black university who
              received his Ph.D. through the MPI and continues to work there during the
              summers.  The close mentoring he can offer his students is a key to their
              success.
