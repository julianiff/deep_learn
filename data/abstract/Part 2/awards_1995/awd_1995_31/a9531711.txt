Abstract    :
              The PI will study the physical processes associated with solar prominences and
              eruption of solar magnetic fields on the basis of computer simulations and
              mathematical theories.  He will observe the formation of solar prominences, the
              formation of a current sheet in an arcade-like geometry, and the eruption of
              prominence-arcade systems.  In particular, he will model the formation and
              eruption of solar prominences as sequential phenomena in one evolutionary track
              of a solar active region.
