Abstract    :
              The undergraduate research participation project in the UNLV  Physics Department
              will be continued during the summers of  1996-1998.  The research efforts are
              in the areas of atomic,  molecular and optical physics, astronomy/astrophysics,
              and  condensed matter physics.  Students will have the  opportunity to obtain
              hands-on laboratory experience using  lasers, to analyze astronomical data on
              workstations using  image analysis software, and to perform numerical 
              computation and simulation using the UNLV computer  facilities.  This proposal
              builds upon the successful  experience of the past four years as a REU site, in
              which  undergraduates have engaged in research in the department.  Students
              will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from  other colleges and
              universities, with special attention paid  to selected schools in the West and
              Mid-West.  Applicants  from institutions where research opportunities are
              limited  will be given higher priority over those from major research 
              universities.
