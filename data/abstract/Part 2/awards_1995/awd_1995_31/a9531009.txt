Abstract    :
              9531009  Ward     This five-year award provides operating funds to the 
              Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC), administered by the  University of
              Wisconsin-Madison, as a national facility for  the utilization of ultra-violet
              and soft x-ray synchrotron  radiation in scientific investigations.  Intense,
              polarized,  tunable beams of photons are provided by the Aladdin storage  ring.
               Aladdin operates with high-brightness bending magnets  and three insertion
              devices.  Studies carried out at the SRC  impact the research fields of
              astronomy, biology, chemistry,  engineering, manufacturing technology,
              materials science,  medicine,  condensed matter physics, and materials physics.
               The SRC is a user oriented facility which builds and  maintains beamlines used
              for basic research, and provides  instruction and technical support for
              individual  investigators who use the beamlines.  SRC support facilities 
              include machine shops, electronics shops, clean assembly  rooms, chemical
              processing laboratories, and a stock room,  available to investigators working
              at the Center.  SRC  accepts proposals from all qualified investigators.  %%% 
              At present, more than 60 groups from universities, industry,  and national
              laboratories conduct research on the 26  operating beamlines at the SRC.   The
              SRC operation includes  11 public beamlines and 15 Participating Research Team
              (PRT)  beamlines.  Several specialized beamlines are under  development.  
              Eighteen operating lines have monochromators  which cover the photon energy
              range from a few eV to several  keV.  The SRC operates at two electron
              energies: 800 MeV and  1 GeV.   Several unique beamlines are available
              including 6  beamlines enclosed in a Class 10 Clean Room operated by the 
              Center for X-ray Lithography.  ***
