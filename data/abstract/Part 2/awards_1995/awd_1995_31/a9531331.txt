Abstract    :
                   This award will provide opportunities for undergraduate  students to
              participate in the National Museum of Natural History  Research Training
              Program at the Smithsonian Institution.  This  program introduces
              undergraduates to the diversity of scientific  disciplines, research
              techniques, and career choices available in  the fields of modern natural
              history and systematic biology.  The  ten-week program focuses on a research
              project guided by a  research advisor who is one of the over 100 Ph.D.s on the 
              institution's scientific staff.  Each student participant, in  conjunction with
              the research advisor, develops and tests a  scientific hypothesis(es) using
              appropriate techniques and  communicates the results in written manuscripts and
              oral  presentations.  That research experience is supplemented with  lectures,
              discussions, demonstrations, field trips, and tours to  provide a broad and
              balanced view of natural history careers.  This previously funded REU Site has
              been very effective in  encouraging women and minority students to pursue
              careers in  natural history and systematic biology.       This award will
              foster the continued education and training  of our next generation of
              researchers in the Biological Sciences.
