Abstract    :
              Over the last decade, several new deep-sea sediment proxies for  important
              oceanic properties have been proposed and developed to  varying degrees.  An
              urgent need has been recognized, though, for  verification and calibration
              studies, particularly in the Southern  Ocean.                This proposal
              focuses on sedimentary 15N/14N ( 15N) and  organic 13C/12C ( 13C org), both of
              which have been shown in core  top and surface ocean studies to exhibit large
              north/south  gradients in the modern Southern Ocean.         Within the JGOFS
              study region in the Pacific Sector of the  Southern Ocean this research team
              will:  1)  Confirm and calibrate  the relationships between NO3 utilization and
               13C in surface  waters.  2)  Determine the fidelity of transfer of the proxy
              signal  to the seafloor.  3)  Determine the magnitude and consistency of  any
              diagenetic effects in the preservation of the proxy signals in  the sediments
              and identify sedimentary fractions for which  diagenetic effects are minimized.
                      Measurements will be made on samples collected seasonally  between the
              subtropical convergence and Ross Sea.
