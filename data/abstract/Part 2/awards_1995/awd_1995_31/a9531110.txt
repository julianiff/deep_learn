Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research and education on polyoxometalates by Dr.   Richard G.
              Finke of the Chemistry Department, Colorado State University.    New classes of
              polyoxometalates will be synthesized, characterized, and   tested as oxidation
              catalysts.  Detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies   will be included. 
              Methods will be developed to use the polyoxometalates   to support
              organometallic derivatives for catalytic use.  Also, a novel   method for using
              molecular oxygen and aldehyde as co-catalysts for   oxidation of important
              olefins such as propylene and ethylene will be   explored.  Polyoxometalate
              anions are complex, negatively-charged groups which   contain a number of metal
              atoms, such as tungsten and titantium; oxygen   atoms; and phosphorus.  In this
              research, new classes of these anions   will be synthesized and developed as
              oxidation catalysts.  The robustness   and inertness of these species make them
              advantageous for this   application, and an approach which uses molecular
              oxygen as an oxidant is   environmentally benign.
