Abstract    :
              9531321  Wiedenbeck, Susan  University of Nebraska-Lincoln    Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates:  Research in Human-Computer Interaction and
              Multimedia Interface Design    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              project will support ten students per year in programs carried out during the
              Summers, for three years.  Students will be recruited from institutions across
              the nation, particularly from predominantly undergraduate institutions and with
              a maximum of three students per year from the University of Nebraska.  The
              research topics will be drawn from the field of human-computer interaction
              (HCI) and multimedia interface design.  The program will involve seminars,
              research projects, and academic year follow-up.  The central activity will be
              the students' research projects during which they will conceptualize a specific
              problem within HCI, design a study to address the problem, instrument the study
              and run pilot tests.  During the follow-up academic year, students will be
              encouraged to continue with data collection and analysis, with the help of the
              PI.  Students are expected to leave the REU project with an understanding of
              the research process and the job of a researcher, an appreciation of creativity
              in science, and a sense of the excitement of scientific discovery.
