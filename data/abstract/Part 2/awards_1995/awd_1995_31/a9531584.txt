Abstract    :
              9531584  Radin    This project has to do with classifying the tilings of
              Euclidean space produceable by copies of a finite set of distinct tiles. The
              investigator plans to apply his recent results on rotation symmetric tilings of
              the plane and space. The methods to be used are a combination of traditional
              ergodic theory and new techniques from aperiodic tilings.    There are
              fundamental mathematical questions in common between the two areas of
              investigation: determining the causes of crystalline symmetry in low
              temperature matter, and classifying the tilings of space by copies of finitely
              many tiles. These are both optimization problems; the crystal problem is
              concerned with determining the basic mechanisms which force low temperature and
              high pressure matter to have the high degree of crystalline order and symmetry
              which is found experimentally.
