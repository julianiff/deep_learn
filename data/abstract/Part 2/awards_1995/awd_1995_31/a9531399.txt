Abstract    :
              9531399  King  The dynamics of nonlinear repetitive systems in the presence  of
              structural mistunings are investigated. Repetitive  systems, such as bladed
              disk assemblies in turbomachinery,  rotor blade  assemblies in helicopters and
              stacked rotating  disks in digital storage media, are characterized by a 
              number of nearly identical qubstructural elements coupled  together in various
              spatial configurations. In this research  project, the combined influences of
              structural mistunings  and nonlinearities in generating localized motions in 
              repetitive structures of engineering importance are  considered. Admissible
              structural mistunings include  variations in material and structural parameters
              (linear  mistunings) and asymmetric nonlinearities (nonlinear  mistunings).
              Both weak and strong nonlinearties are  investigated for their effectiveness in
              generating spatially  localized notions. Analytical characterization of
              mistuned  repetitive structures using multiple-scales and nonlinear  normal
              mode techniques are advanced. Structural parameters  of importance in
              generating motion confinement  characteristics and vibration isolation
              techniques are  identified via numerical and experimental investigations.***
