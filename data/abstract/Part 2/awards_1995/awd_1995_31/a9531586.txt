Abstract    :
              95-31586  A'Hearn    Dr. A'Hearn and his Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Timothy 
              A. Livengood,  will carry out ground-based thermal infrared (IR)  observations
              of Jupiter  and its environment, supporting and complementing an  international
               ultraviolet (UV) observing program.  Dr. Livengood is one of  the two 
              principal investigators of the international UV observing  program.  Both the 
              IR and UV efforts will run in parallel with and complement  the observations 
              of Jupiter by NASA's Galileo mission, which is presently  orbiting the planet 
              and obtaining data.    The ground-based thermal IR observations will be carried
              out  with the  thermal-infrared imaging camera at the European Southern 
              Observatory.  The  wavelengths of the observations are chosen to coincide with 
              emissions from a  range of hydrocarbons.  The objective is to understand 
              better the auroral  activity in the Jovian System, the transfer of material
              from  Jupiter's  satellite Io to the plasma torus surrounding Jupiter, 
              energization of the  torus plasma, seasonal response and photochemistry in the 
              planet's  stratosphere, and energization of day glow emission.  ***
