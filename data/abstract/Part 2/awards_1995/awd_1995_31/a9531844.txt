Abstract    :
              9531844  Moo-Young    The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of
               freezing and  thawing on the permeability of fine-grained soils used for 
              landfill cover  material.  Laboratory-compacted samples of fine-grained  soils
              used in  landfill covers are subjected to one- and three- dimensional 
              freezing.  The  permeability of the frozen and thawed samples is measured. 
              X-ray  techniques are performed on unfrozen and frozen laboratory  compacted
              clay  samples to analyze if the formation of ice lenses and  shrinkage cracks
              are  caused by freezing and thawing, or if the ice lenses and  shrinkage cracks
               are created by the method of compaction.  The microstructure  of  fine-grained
              soils subjected to various freeze/thaw cycles  is studied using  scanning
              electron microscopy to determine particle  orientation and  distribution that
              results from freezing and thawing.  ***
