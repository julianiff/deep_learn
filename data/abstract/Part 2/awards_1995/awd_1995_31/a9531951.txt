Abstract    :
              9531951  Paulson  This research was inspired by a number of reports on 
              competitiveness of the U. S. construction industry in the  late 1980's that
              recommended encouraging private sector  construction R&D and increasing
              technoloey transfer efforts.  This research will provide insight into ways that
              technology  transfer can be promoted through understanding of social  network
              influences on diffusion, including: the direct  exchange of advice, the
              location of decision-makers in the  web of advice relations, and key
              individuals with many  advice relations.  In addition to informing managers and
               policy makers, the results will contribute to the background  of social
              network diffusion theory and empirical results,  which can be applied to future
              studies.  ***
