Abstract    :
              9531394   Noronha     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              is aimed at the design, integration and test of a complete system for
              transporting point-to-multipoint (i.e., one sender, multiple destinations)
              compressed video streams over traditional computer networks, both in the LAN
              and in the WAN environments. The advent of MPEG compression has made it
              possible to encode high-quality video using relatively low bandwidth. This
              makes it possible to transport video using traditional LAN and WAN
              technologies.  From a transmission technology point of view, the main problems
              to be solved are error control and latency for interactive applications. The
              research proposed here will investigate the use of Forward Error Correction
              (FEC) for error control, and changes in the MPEG encoding scheme to reduce
              latency. FEC has been chosen because it is scalable to an arbitrary number of
              destinations, and has little impact in the system latency. Additionally, error
              concealment techniques will be investigated for occasions where there are
              uncorrected errors. Session layer protocols and user-interface issues will also
              be considered, to complete the system design.   Commercial applications include
              video distribution (replacing analog channels),  remote teaching, remote
              surveillance and video conferencing, both in LAN and WAN  environments,
