Abstract    :
              ***  9531290  Henkens  This Phase II SBIR project will develop and commercialize
              ASV-based instruments for metal testing in field or small laboratory
              applications for process monitoring and environmental testing. The methodology
              will include the use of screen printed sensors containing an
              ultramicroelectrode array of nanometer-sized gold particles, that provide high
              heavy metal sensitivity. The sensors will be inexpensively mass produced,
              pre-calibrated, and used with inexpensive, small, electronic monitors. Lead
              monitors, in particular, are clearly needed. Lead poisoning is an environmental
              and public health hazard of global proportion. Ubiquitous environmental
              contamination has led to mandated screening programs instigated by numerous
              countries that will require millions of tests annually, most accomplished in
              small laboratories. Demand for portable instruments capable of field and small
              laboratory testing for heavy metals in complex sample matrices is increasing
              dramatically, especially in the environmental market. Ground waters and
              industrial process waters and effluents require tests of metal levels; lead,
              copper, cadmium, mercury and zinc being of particular concern. Traditional
              heavy metal determinations employ relatively large, expensive instruments used
              under the supervision of skilled professionals. The fieldable sensor/monitor
              units resulting from this project can measure a wide range of metals and
              overcome the expense and difficulty of operating and maintaining these large
              instruments.  The expected products are disposable, high-sensitivity,
              metal-specific sensors paired with a reusable hand-held electrochemical
              monitor. The disposable sensors in combination with the monitor will determine
              the concentrations of lead, copper and other heavy metals and will meet the
              criteria of 10 minute assay times in field and small laboratory settings, with
              appropriate sensitivity and accuracy, at approximately $1.00 per test.  ***
