Abstract    :
                Abstract    9531545  Pauley    This REU Site will provide opportunities for
              10-12 mechanical engineering students to participate in research related to
              real problems in manufacturing systems, control systems, thermal systems,
              combustion and fluid mechanics.  Each student will work one-on-one with a
              faculty advisor to define and execute a complete and original research study. 
              The student will be expected to take an active role in defining the objectives
              of the study and the research methods to be used.  During the research process,
              the student will apply and extend the knowledge gained from engineering
              courses.  The final results of the research will be a report detailing the
              procedures and results of the investigation, and a formal oral presentation
              during the final seminar week of the summer program.
