Abstract    :
              OCE-9531500    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in 
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used  aboard the R/V
              ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by  the NSF and operated by the
              University.  Instrumentation funded  includes computers, a CD ROM data
              recorder/reader, a cover for the  MOCHNESS system, a back-up CTD underwater
              unit.  The requested  instrumentation is necessary to support cruises funded by
              NSF in  1996 and will enhance the scientific capabilities of the vessel in  the
              future.
