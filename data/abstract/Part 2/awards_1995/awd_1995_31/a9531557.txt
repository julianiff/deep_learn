Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop an
              improved non-destructive evaluation (NDE) system based on an ultrasensitive
              room-temperature magnetic sensor.  The research is for a magnetoresistive eddy
              current instrument which will have unique capabilities including (1)
              low-frequency inspection through thick layers of aluminum or steel, (2)
              broad-band measurements from zero to several megahertz, and (3) large-area
              scanning-array imaging with high scan rates and high spatial resolution. 
              During Phase I, the research instrument detected a small cavity on the back
              surface of an aluminum plate 4.9mm thick.  The signal-to-noise ratio indicated
              that a crack roughly 1mm in diameter could be detected through 10mm of
              aluminum.  During Phase II, research will be conducted to further enhance the
              instrument by establishing its sensitivity for detecting cracks and thickness
              loss, and by applying it to NDE problems to illustrate the potential
              applications in both aviation and maintenance of industrial infrastructure. 
              This project activities will combine the firm's expertise in sensitive magnetic
              measurements with Kodak's improved sensor technology.  In addition, Boeing and
              South West Research Institute will contribute to NDE experiments and the design
              of a practical NDE system.    If successful, the improved NDE technology will
              reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of inspecting aircraft and aging
              infrastructure.  Representative applications include (1) detecting cracks and
              corrosion in thick and multilayer aircraft structures, (2) inspection of steel
              tubes in power-plant heat exchangers, (3) detecting corrosion under insulation,
              and (4) inspecting a reactor pressure vessel through its stainless-steel
              cladding.
