Abstract    :
              9531575  Chakravarty  This grant is a renewal of an ongoing program led by a
              mid-  career condensed matter theorist.  The topics of interest in  this grant
              are Quantum Magnetism and non-Fermi liquid ground  sates.  In quantum
              magnetism, the PI proposes to calculate  the dynamic structure factor of a
              2-dimensional quantum  antiferromagnet.  The calculation will  help understand
              the  neutron scattering measurements and provide insight into a  special class
              of fermionic excitations (spinons) at short  wavelengths and high energies. 
              Also planned is a study of  the materials which exhibit "colossal"
              magnetoresistance.  The research on non-Fermi liquids, using concept of scaling
               and effective fields, will involve phenomenology and  possible classification.
               %%%  In a world where materials are either metallic or  nonmetallic, current
              research is converging on a class of  materials that show metallic character in
              resistivity but  all of their other properties (specific heat, magnetic 
              susceptibility) are quite anomalous.  This grant will  develop a
              phenomenological theory of such non-Fermi liquids.  The grant also includes
              work on quantum antiferromagnets in  2-dimension.  As a theoretical problem
              this addresses some  outstanding questions  since the PI's earlier seminal 
              contributions.  ***
