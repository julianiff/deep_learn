Abstract    :
              9531425  Parker  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              pertains to neural network methods for achieving Self-sensing active magnetic
              bearings (AMBs).  AMBs employ collars of electromagnets to levitate rotors. 
              The absence of mechanical contact and elimination of need for lubrication
              systems are advantages that make AMBs a candidate technology for the
              replacement of rolling-element and fluid-film bearings in many rotating
              machinery applications.  Stabilization of the rotor requires that controllers
              be provided the instantaneous values of rotor displacement and coil current. 
              Self-sensing AMBs exploit the fact that the current and voltage signals in the
              actuation coils can provide the information needed to sense rotor position. 
              The fundamental reason for this is that the inductive coupling between rotor
              and stator is displacement-dependent.  Phase I demonstrated the basic technical
              feasibility of self-sensing AMBs, even when the bearings are saturated
              magnetically.  Static polynomial neural networks (PNN's) play a central role in
              computing displacement based on nonlinear functional relationships among
              current and voltage signal features.  Phase II efforts will focus on perfecting
              and generalizing the technique, and on demonstrating the performance of
              PNN-based rotor position estimators operating in the closed-loop feedback
              control of an AMB rig.   The use of sensorless magnetic bearings, although
              potentially beneficial wherever AMBs are employed, will be especially important
              in high-volume, low-cost applications (e.g., small pumps, air conditioning and
              refrigeration compressors, energy-storing flywheels for automotive
              applications, etc.) where the cost of sensing instrumentation can be
              prohibitive.  In many applications, e.g., for reasons such as reliability, high
              temperatures, etc., conventional bearings cannot be utilized.
