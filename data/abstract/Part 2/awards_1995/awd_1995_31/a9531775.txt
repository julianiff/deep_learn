Abstract    :
                      Johnson  9531775   The goal of the 1996 REU project at Gustavus Adolphus
              College is to nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in the
              geological sciences.  Eight undergraduate women will conduct field and
              laboratory research to determine the character, origin, and history of
              Pleistocene deposits in south-central Minnesota.  Four of the women will be
              selected from Gustavus students, the other four will come from outside the
              institution.     The individual research projects are concerned with till
              stratigraphy of south-central Minnesota, genesis of late-Wisconsin till
              (possibly a deforming-bed till), character and sedimentology of River Warren
              (outlet of Lake Agassiz), and Holocene colluvial fans of the Minnesota River
              valley.  These projects will require the participants to learn and apply
              various geologic research techniques including outcrop description, laboratory
              analysis, and statistical analysis on the computer.  REU students will examine
              issues in scientific ethics and women in science, with input from professional
              women in the Geosciences.  At the close of the session, they will present a
              professional talk, lead a field trip, and interact with a group of visiting
              glacial geologists from other parts of Minnesota.  The last two weeks consist
              of a field excursion to active glaciers in the Canadian Rockies to study
              glacial processes first hand.
