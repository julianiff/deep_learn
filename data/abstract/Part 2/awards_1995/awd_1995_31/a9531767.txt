Abstract    :
                  In this project, a system will be developed to monitor the state of  the
              magnetosphere by abstracting geophysically significant  information from
              nighside energetic particle precipitation measured  by detectors on the DMSP
              spacecraft.  This work follows similar  work successfully accomplished on
              dayside precipitation data and  quite extensively utilized by the space science
              community.  The  system will be automated using quantitative algorithms and
              will  determine (1) the "zero energy" convection boundary (often the  plasma
              pause), (2) the point where the large scale gradient in the  electron average
              energy vs latitude changes from positive to  negative (the start of the main
              plasma sheet), (3) the ion high-  energy precipitation cutoff, (the start of
              the tail current sheet),  (4) the stable trapping boundary for greater that 35
              KeV electrons  (also a marker for the start of the tail current sheet), as well
              as  a variety of other parameters of geophysical significance.  These  various
              parameters will be investigated to produce indices which  may be used to
              characterize the magnetosphere with more accuracy  than do the present indices
              such as Kp and AE.
