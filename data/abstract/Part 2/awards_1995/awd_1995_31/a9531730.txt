              Experiences for Undergraduates:  Multiple Autonomous Mobile Robots For Search
              And Rescue Applications    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project
              will support ten students per year in programs carried out both during the
              Summers and the academic years, for two years.  Activities will include
              technical (e.g., hands-on laboratory skills), intellectual (e.g.,
              problem-solving skills), and on professional and personal development (e.g.,
              communication and management skills).  The project targets both CSM resident
              students and students from traditionally minority institutions.    In the first
              year and a half, the students will use two identical mobile robots certified
              for search and rescue activities in underground mines and will demonstrate and
              test their results in the CSM Edgar Experimental mine.  During the second year,
              the participants will transfer their software to small robots suitable for SAR
              work in collapsed buildings.  The use of two sets of robots and two variations
              of the same task will reinforce the development of general purpose solutions
              and basic software engineering skills.  Analysis and design procedures will be
              emphasized at each step of the project and the project also entails significant
              written and oral presentations during the year.  ***
