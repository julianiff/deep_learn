Abstract    :
                  Abstract    9531634  Burns    In this REU Site program the students will
              work on programs in electronic materials, energy conversion devices, growth
              techniques, semiconductor device design and fabrication, photonic bandgap
              structures and microwave devices.  As part of their research training the
              students take a 4-credit hour laboratory-oriented course during the summer,
              which will teach them about fabrication and characterization techniques in
              semiconductor materials and devices.  The students will be supervised by
              faculty in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the
              Microelectronics Research Center.
