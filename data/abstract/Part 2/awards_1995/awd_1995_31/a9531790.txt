Abstract    :
              9531790  Dalgarno    Dr. Dalgarno will direct theoretical studies of X-ray
              dominated  regions of space with the intent of identifying specific  diagnostic
              probes that may distinguish between regions ionized by  X-rays and by cosmic
              rays.  The infrared response of molecular  hydrogen as a function of density
              will be calculated.  The  chemistry of deuterated molecular species in the
              early Universe  will be explored.  The molecular composition of circumstellar 
              shells will be examined using a refined treatment of radiative  transfer. 
              Particular attention will be given to the discrepancy  between the present
              model abundance and the measured abundance of  neutral carbon atoms in
              IRC+10216.  Semiclassical calculations of  rate coefficients of rovibrational
              transitions of molecular  hydrogen in collision with H will be completed and
              quantal  calculations required for low temperatures will be initiated.  Charge
              transfer collisions of singly charged species interacting  with neutral atoms
              will be studied.  ***
