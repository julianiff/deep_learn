Abstract    :
              9531190  Laumann  This research traces Immigration Service identification and
              processing of Chinese immigrants and the immigrants reactions to the Service's
              activities.  It specifically focuses on the creation of "paper families"
              through the sale and creation of fictive kinship ties to circumvent nearly
              ironclad immigrations laws in the United States from 1882-1943.  The project
              seeks to demonstrate how Chinese personal identity developed through the
              interplay of human actions and structural constraints.  It also seeks to show
              how the nature of immigration administration developed in part in reaction to
              these Chinese immigrant methods of creating identity.  It will advance
              understanding of a key element of Chinese-American identity and culture.  %%%%
