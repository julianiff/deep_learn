Abstract    :
              9531669  Linsky (Task Order "B")    This task order with Friday Systems Services
              (FSS) deals with providing support to the ITS/CTS programs that support
              interfacial, transport and separation research.  The primary type of support
              from FSS is in the area of developing and maintaining a computer information
              data base.  There are three major subtasks.  The first provides project data
              base information (project inventories; project accomplishments).  The second
              subtask deals with obtaining information on current research trends and future
              needs from research leaders and principal investigators, and placing the
              information in a standardized retrievable data base.  The third subtasks is
              related to building a reviewer data base system.  The activity covers both the
              1414 and 1417 program subelements, and funds for this task opder come from
              those program subelements.
