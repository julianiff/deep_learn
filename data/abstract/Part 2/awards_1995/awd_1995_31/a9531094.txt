Abstract    :
                  This project involves an investigation of plasma wave phenomena  which play
              an important role in the nergization of ions and  electrons in the topside
              ionosphere.  A new mechanism that enables  the transfer of wave energy from
              large-scale waves to small-scale  waves is of particular interest.  The
              small-scale waves have been  observed to be associated with elevated ion
              temperatures and  intense field-aligned electron fluxes.  The recent Freja
              satellite  observations together with preliminary theoretical results indicate 
              a causal relationship between the transfer of Alfven wave energy to  ion
              acoustic waves and the heating of ions together with parallel  electron
              acceleration.  The primary goal of this project will be to  identify and
              characterize the underlying mechanisms of energy  transfer from waves to
              particles.  The study involves a combination  of analysis, numerical simulation
              and comparison to spacecraft data  to ascertain physical characteristics of the
              phenomena as well as  their geophysical relevance.
