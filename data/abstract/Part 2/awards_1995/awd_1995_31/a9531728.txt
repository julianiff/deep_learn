Abstract    :
              Sisk  9602169    Puberty is a well-defined developmental phase when reproductive
               function and behaviors mature in animal species.  The maturation  process
              begins in a poorly defined manner and is propagated further  by changes in
              gonadal steroid sensitivity.  Unfortunately, a  thorough understanding of the
              mechanisms triggering puberty has  been elusive.  Dr. Sisk's investigations
              focus on how androgenic  steroid hormones, such as testosterone, influence
              brain function  differently in reproductively immature and adult males. 
              Juvenile  males are relatively unresponsive to the effects of testosterone on 
              behaviors related to reproduction, and Dr. Sisk is identifying the  neuronal
              elements of prepubertal males responsible for the lack of  responsivity and the
              underlying causes.  In addition, the idea of  puberty as a developmental stage
              during which steroid hormones can  permanently shape brain organization and
              function are being  addressed.  These investigations will provide important 
              contributions to an understanding of how brain processes change  during
              puberty, and will also have more general applicability to an  understanding of
              hormonal influences on the nervous system  throughout the lifespan.  These
              investigations contribute  significantly to our understanding of species
              survival in the  natural setting and the neurobiological basis for successful 
              reproduction.
