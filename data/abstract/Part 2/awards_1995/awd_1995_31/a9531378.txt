Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9531378  Vetelino    The Electrical Engineering Department at the
              University of Maine will offer ten undergraduate students the opportunity to
              participate in research.  The available research projects include:  1.
              Microwave Acoustic solid State Sensors, 2. Robotics, Computer Vision and Neural
              Processing, 3. Communications Devices and Applications, 4. Motion Control, 5.
              Microprocessing/Instrumentation Applications, 6. Macroscopic and Microscopic
              Characterization of Metallic Films, and 7. Power Systems Applications.  in
              addition to extensive University of Maine facilities, the students will also
              have access to facilities at nearby industries such as Bangor Hydro Electric
              Power and Central Maine Power Companies, James River, Champion and Scott paper
              Companies, Digital Equipment Corporation and National Semiconductor during the
              conduct of their research experience.
