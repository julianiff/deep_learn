Abstract    :
              9531576  Garity   This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
              researchers in   mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty
              advisors. The program will   run for eight weeks. The principal investigator
              and two additional faculty members from   the Mathematics Department and the
              Computer Science Department will supervise   student research projects. The
              students will attend a  daily seminar and will be given   information about
              various areas of mathematics and computer science. the research   projects that
              the students work on will be designed so as to make the students familiar  
              with the process of mathematical research. Each student must complete a written
              report   on their research activities for inclusion in a proceedings of the
              summer program.
