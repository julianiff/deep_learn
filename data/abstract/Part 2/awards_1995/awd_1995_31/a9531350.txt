Abstract    :
                          9531350  Manduca   The Keck Geology Consortium combines the
              resources of twelve predominantly undergraduate colleges and universities to
              offer high-quality projects designed to engage students and faculty in
              collaborative research.  Two types of projects will be offered: five-week
              summer projects for students who have completed their sophomore years, and
              year-long projects for students who have completed their junior years.  All
              students will present the results of their work at the Keck Research Symposium
              in Geology.  Twenty sophomore and six junior students of minority heritage and
              eight minority faculty will be recruited nationally to participate in the Keck
              Geology Consortium program.  Students of color who participate in this program
              can test their interest in geology early in their academic careers, obtain
              excellent credentials for employment or further study, and become part of an
              extended network of students and faculty that will aid them as they move into
              the professional world.  Past experience indicates that these students will
              continue successfully into advanced schooling or careers in geology.
