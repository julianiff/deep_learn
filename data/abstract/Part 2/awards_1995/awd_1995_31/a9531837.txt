Abstract    :
              The  research focuses on developing millimeter-scale robotic  tools  with  force
              feedback and tele-taction for  performing  tissue  manipulation for minimally
              invasive remote  surgery.  Key  elements  of  the  project  are:  (1) 
              prototyping   of  millimeter-scale   robotic   hands   for  teleoperation   in 
              minimally invasive procedures; (2) modeling and manipulation  of  compliant 
              tissue; and (3) millimeter scale teletaction.  The  research program  will be
              carried out on a telesurgical  workstation  incorporating millimeter-scale
              robots  equipped  with  force  and tactile sensing, larger positioning  robots 
              for  holding  the  instruments,  and  a  surgical  interface  including a
              bi-manual surgical master with tactile  displays  and  force  feedback  .  For
              the purposes  of  training  and  procedure  rehearsal, the surgeon will be able
               to  try  out  his/her  actions on the surgical master using the  simulator 
              before  implementation. In the first year  of  the  project,  surgical 
              procedures like blunt dissection, catheterization,  suturing  and anastomosis
              will be explored.  In  the  second  year the system prototypes will be tested
              on procedures such  as  dissection  of  the peritoneum and suturing  of 
              ex-vivo  stomach  tissue.   In  the third year, a complex  procedure,  known 
              as  Nissen  undoplication to control stomach  reflux,  will be tried as proof
              of the entire system.
