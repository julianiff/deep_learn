Abstract    :
              9531011  Raven    This award provides initial funding to establish the new  U.S.
              Civilian Research and Development Foundation for the  independent States of the
              Former Soviet Union (CRDF).  The  CRDF is a nongovernmental, non-profit
              foundation to support  collaborative basic research and collaborative applied 
              research projects between American scientists and engineers  and their
              counterparts in the 12 independent states of the  former Soviet Union.  The
              projects should enhance the  conservation of the scientific and technological 
              infrastructure in the countries concerned, promote defense  conversion, and
              contribute to the transition to market-based  economies.  Fields of science and
              fields of application will  be determined in consultations between the CRDF and
               counterparts in the former Soviet Union.  CRDF is being  established in
              accordance with the purposes of Section 511  of the FREEDOM Support Act of
              1992.  ***
