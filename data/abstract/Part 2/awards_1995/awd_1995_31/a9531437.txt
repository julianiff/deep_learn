Abstract    :
              9531437  McCormick      This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project
              will develop a capacitively coupled microwave plasma (CCMP) as a microsample
              excitation plasma for multielement determinations with the detection limits,
              accuracy, precision and sample size requirements of modern graphite furnace
              atomic absorption spectrometry using atomic emission spectrometry.  Currently,
              there are no widely applicable analytical methods for multielement
              determinations on microsamples.  In the unique CCMP approach the helium plasma
              supported on an electrode in the microwave field envelops a tungsten cup
              containing the liquid (2 - 10 microliters) or solid (ca. 1mg) sample.  The
              transient emission is detected with an echelle spectrometer using a Charge
              Injection Device (CID) detector.  Detection limits are in the low pg range with
              10 microliter liquid samples (0.5-5 ppb).  Studies using the Thermo Jarrell Ash
              IRIS echelle spectrometer indicated that the CCMP is well suited for
              multielement detection.  Phase II will include the design of an optimum optical
              interface between the plasma and the echelle spectrometer, optimization of the
              CID data acquisition for transient signals, refinement in the electrode,
              redesign of the power supply to allow more reproducible computer control of the
              microwave field, and a comprehensive study of potential interferences in a
              variety of matrices, using both liquid and solid samples.    The unique
              combination of multielement capability, high sensitivity, low cost, and ease of
              use results in substantral potential markets in clinical research, medical
              diagnostics, and routine laboratory analysis.
