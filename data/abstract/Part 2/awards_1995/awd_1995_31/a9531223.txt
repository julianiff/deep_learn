Abstract    :
              9531223  Pinski  This theoretical renewal grant focuses on first-principles 
              calculations of atomic correlations in metallic alloys.  For  iron-nickel
              alloys, existing theories and computer codes  will be used to calculate several
              properties of these alloys  including the total energy as a function of volume
              and  magnetic arrangement, and atomic short-range order.  While  currrent
              theories should be sufficient in the nickel-rich  region of the phase diagram,
              the effect of atomic  displacements needs to be included for the iron-rich end.
               For iron-nickel alloys with about thirty-seven percent  nickel (INVAR), many
              properties have anomalous behavior as a  function of temperature, pressure or
              magnetic field.  This  behavior has been linked to strong magneto-volume
              coupling.  Current computational codes will be extended to include  these
              effects.     The utility of the calculated direct-correlation function  can be
              increased by its use in a theory of first-order phase  transitions.  The
              current approach looks at the instability  of the random alloy to a
              concentration wave with an  infinitesimal amplitude and therefore only gives
              indication  of possible second-order transitions.  Since most alloy 
              transitions are first-order, density functional theory will  be used to
              calculate the coexistence region.  %%%  A computationally-intensive program
              will investigate the  effects of atomic correlations on the properties of
              metallic  alloys - in particular, iron-nickel alloys.  These state-of-  the-art
              calculations will yield new insight to understanding  the behavior of this
              important class of materials.  In  addition, fundamental insight will be gained
              into the phase  behavior of alloys in general.  ***
