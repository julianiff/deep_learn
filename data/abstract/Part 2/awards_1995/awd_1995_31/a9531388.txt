Abstract    :
              DMI-9531388  Adler   Ion implantation can change the properties of a surface
              without changing the underlying substrate.  This technology has growing
              applications in wear reduction and corrosion reduction of metal surfaces.  Many
              of these applications have been limited by the fact that implantation is
              usually a "line of sight process.  Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) has
              the potential to overcome this limitation as long as the plasma can be made to 
               "conform" to the surface throughout the implant's duration.  Limitations in
              plasma density and power system drive conditions often limit the degree to
              which the implant conforms to the surface.  By increasing the plasma density
              and power system peak power, those limitations can be overcome, leading to a
              significant improvement in the uniformity of the implant and a subsequent
              increase in implant utility as a surface modification technique.  In phase I we
              demonstrated through experiments that we could produce a system in which the
              plasma conformed to the object being implanted to within 1-2 cm.  This was
              accomplished through improvements in the plasma source, and in the pulsed power
              system which powers the implantation.  In our proposed phase II program, we
              will upgrade existing pulsed power equipment at NSRC and build a new high
              density plasma source in order to perform conformal implants of this type at
              high power.   The proposed technology will make it possible to apply
              implantation to surfaces which are "bumpy" such as dies and molds.  This will
              increase the range of applications over which this technique can be used and
              improve tool die lifetime.
