Abstract    :
              ***  Smith  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the Rice 
              Quantum Institute of Rice University will be continued.  The  main objective of
              the program is to provide undergraduate  students with an opportunity to
              observe and participate in  research in a highly-interdisciplinary university
              research  environment with strong faculty support.  The program has,  and will
              continue to focus on active participation in  research, but also strives to
              show the participants how the  research funding process works, give them
              insight into  applications of basic research, and provide them with an 
              understanding of the fundamental motivations for research  activity.  Each
              undergraduate becomes affiliated with one of  the 25 research groups at the
              Quantum Institute, and works  on an independent project that he/she can bring
              to  completion in the allotted ten-week time frame.  In addition  to research
              activities, a special seminar series for the  participants is organized in
              which invited speakers deal  with topics ranging from "hot" topics in research,
               commercial applications of basic research, entrepreneurship,  graduate
              schools, opportunities for employment, and other  topics.  ***
