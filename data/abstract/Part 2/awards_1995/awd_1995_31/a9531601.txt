Abstract    :
               Abstract:  A Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the Geophysical
              Institute of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, will support 8 undergraduate
              researchers in solid earth geophysics for each of the next two years.  The
              program will give undergraduates majoring in the Geosciences and related
              disciplines experience in the types of research conducted at the Institute. 
              The objective is to engage students in the exciting research opportunities in
              seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, paleomagnetics, geodesy,
              tectonics, glaciers and sea ice, and remote sensing, and encourage them to
              pursue graduate studies in these or other scientific areas.   Recruiting is
              focused at small liberal arts colleges where research exposure is less
              available.  Students get an accurate perspective on graduate student life by
              interacting with faculty, and graduate students, attending seminars and thesis
              defenses, and working closely with existing research groups.  Weekly lectures
              and field trips expose the students to fields of research `eyond their own
              projects.  A survey will be conducted to measure the impact of the REU program
              on educational and career choices of former participants.
