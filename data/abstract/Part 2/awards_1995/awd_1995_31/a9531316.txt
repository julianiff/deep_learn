Abstract    :
              9531316  Popovici  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
              develop and test computational software that offers the same accuracy as full
              3-D prestack migration at a much lower cost. Applying prestack depth migration
              to 3-D seismic information is the main computational challenge facing the oil
              industry today. Cheaper and faster 3-D prestack imaging methods could open up
              new exploration venues in extremely complicated geological conditions such as
              those that exist in the overthrust region of the Western United States and
              below layers of salt in the Gulf of Mexico.  The novel imaging algorithm
              migrates seismic data to a common offset in a laterally-variable velocity
              earth, and can simplify 3-D prestack depth migration, reduce the number of
              calculations, and overcome the problems associated with manipulating very large
              prestack data volumes. The end result of this research effort is a migration to
              common-offset (MCO) algorithm that can be used to process the two main types of
              seismic data: marine and land. For marine datasets, MCO coherently stacks data
              along several azimuths, and is followed by common-azimuth migration for final
              imaging. For land datasets, MCO coherently stacks data for a predetermined
              number of vector offsets (fixed azimuth and offset length) and is followed by
              3-D Kirchhoff migration for imaging the reduced size dataset.   The new MCO
              algorithm is of interest to oil companies and oil-field contractors. The
              proposed method better delineates the oil field structure and is used in oil
              exploration and reservoir monitoring and characterization. Both the oil
              companies that process seismic data in-house and the dataprocessing contractors
              would benefit from such a method because it allows sophisticated detailed
              processing at a much lower cost and over a shorter time frame.
