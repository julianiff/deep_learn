Abstract    :
              9531086  Rock  This is an award to support conduct of a conference to address 
              issues of importance to the education of environmental engineers,  a
              significant component of which involves conduct of research by  university
              faculty with the assistance of students primarily at  the graduate level. 
              Session content addresses issues of  importance in preparing graduates for
              environmental engineering  practice.  Sessions scheduled include consideration
              of the  attributes expected of program graduates in terms the market for  their
              services, educational approaches and curricula for meeting  practitioner
              perceptions and needs, roles of practitioners in  enhancing the content of
              curricula and the role of practitioners  in influencing innovations in
              education of engineers for  environmental engineering practice.  The conference
              will be conducted at the University of Maine from  August 3-6, 1996 by the
              Association of Environmental Engineering  Professors under auspices of the
              University of Maine in joint  sponsorship with the American Academy of
              Environmental Engineers.  Results are expected to be used for program planning.
