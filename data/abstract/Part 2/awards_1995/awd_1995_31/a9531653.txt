Abstract    :
              9531653  Young     The proposed conference is in the area dynamical systems with
              an   interdisciplinary theme. Planned talks cover a spectrum of topics ranging
              from   Komogorov-Arnold-Moser theory to celestial mechanics. Parts of dynamical
                systems have matured in the last few decades with many success stories; a  
              stated aim is to re-examine the directions of the subject and to encourage  
              possible interactions with other parts of mathematics and mathematical physics.
                 Dynamical systems theory has been a very active area with a variety of  
              applications: fluid motion, various ecological phenomena, and planetary motion 
               are among the more standard applications. In fact, any reasonably sized  
              physical system varying smoothly in time can, in principle, be modeled as a  
              dynamical system. The proposed conference seeks to further identify these  
              physical applications of dynamical systems.
