Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to identify the fundamental modes of   reactivity
              of transition metal complex containing oxo and imido   functions.  Detailed
              kinetic analyses of stoichiometric osmylation   reactions will be performed,
              augmented by electrochemical studies.  In   another set of experiments
              involving osmium -catalyzed dihydroxylation ,   X-ray crystallography and
              microcalorimetry will be used to provide   evidence about complexation between
              alkaloid ligands and olefinic   substrates.   Finally, the catalytic method for
              the aminohydroxylation of   alkenes via an osmium (VIII) species will be
              optimized. With this award,   the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. K. Barry   Sharpless of the Department of Chemistry at the
              Scripps Clinic and   Research Foundation.  Professor Sharpless will focus his
              work on   elucidating the fundamental mechanism of reactivity of transition
              metals   complexes containing metal-heteroatom multiple bonds.  A substantial  
              amount of the effort will focus on the reaction of osmium tetroxide with  
              alkenes in the presence of coordinating tertiary amines.  This reaction   has
              achieved prominence as a method for the introduction of stereogenic   centers
              into organic molecules.  Yet very little is actually known about   how this
              process occurs..
