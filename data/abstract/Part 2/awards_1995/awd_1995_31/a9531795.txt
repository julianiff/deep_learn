              The conference "Modern Algebra and its Applications" will take place May 14-18,
                1996, at Vanderbilt University. This conference will highlight significant  
              recent developments in modern algebra and its interactions with logic,  
              combinatorics and computer science. The aims of the conference are to bring  
              together researchers working in a broad range of contemporary algebra and its  
              applications.
