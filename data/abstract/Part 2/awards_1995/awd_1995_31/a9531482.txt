                 This research will support the investigation of the formation  of  interface
               roughness  during  growth/etching  of  surfaces  under  conditions far from
              equilibrium. Interface roughness is a central  issue in thin film deposition
              and directly controls many physical  and  chemical  properties of the films.
              The  goals  are  to  grow  amorphous  films and test unambiguously the validity
               of  various  proposed   mechanisms  based  on  noise  induced   growth   front
               roughening.  Differentiation of various roughness mechanisms in a  molecular
              beam epitaxy (MBE) growth front will be carried out  as  will   the 
              development  of  real  time  diffraction  techniques,  especially light
              scattering for quantitative measurement of rough  surface growth in a hostile
              deposition environment.  %%%  This research will support the investigation of

              used and  a  light  scattering technique for the in situ monitoring of rough 
              surface  growth will be developed.  ***
