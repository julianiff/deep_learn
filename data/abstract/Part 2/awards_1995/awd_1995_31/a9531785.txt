Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9631785    This is a study of the surface chemistry underlying the
              deposition of cadmium zinc telluride alloy films by metallorganic chemical
              vapor deposition (MOCVD).  It includes characterizing the atomic structure and
              composition of the film as it nucleates and grows on a gallium arsenide or a
              germanium (001) surface.  Alloy growth kinetics are determined by a combination
              of ultrahigh vacuum   (UHV) surface-science experiments, macroscopic
              measurements of film deposition rates, and numerical simulations of the MOCVD
              process.  The heteroepitaxy of cadmium zinc telluride on gallium arsenide or
              germanium (001) is studied using a UHV scanning tunneling microscope to monitor
              the evolution of the interface structure as each layer of  atoms is deposited. 
              The quality of the films is evaluated using transmission electron microscopy
              and photoluminescence measurements.    Epitaxial thin films of  II-VI compounds
              such as cadmium zinc telluride are used in a variety of optoelectronic and
              magentic devices.  Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a
              promising method for depositing these films.  However, it is a challenging
              process in a manufacturing environment because the film growth rate and
              composition depend on the intrinsic reaction kinetics, making them very
              sensitive to the operating conditions.  This effort provides the basic
              knowledge needed to provide reproducible growth of thin films of  II-VI
              compound semiconductors.  ***
