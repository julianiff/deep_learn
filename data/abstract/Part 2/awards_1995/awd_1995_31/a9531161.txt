Abstract    :
              9531161  Schick  This project is concerned with various aspects of self- 
              assembling systems, such as block copolymers and lipids.  Microphase separation
              will be considered in systems of  potential technological importance, such as
              diblock,  triblock and dendritic copolymers.  There will also be a  study of
              the ternary mixtures of diblock and homopolymers,  an examination of the
              swollen lamellar phases and the effect  of fluctuations on them.  The
              interfacial profiles and their  energy of the interfaces between different
              microphases will  be calculated.  Finally there will be analysis of the self- 
              assembly effects in biological membranes during  electroporation and rupture. 
              %%%  A better understanding  of  self-assembly in polymers is the  objective in
              this grant. The self-assembly involves phase  separation in a binary and
              ternary mixtures and the  properties of the interfaces.  There are special
              phases and  configurations that are studied for their properties.  The 
              technological applications of the systems studied here are  in the vast range
              between detergent and drug transport  through the membranes and cells.
