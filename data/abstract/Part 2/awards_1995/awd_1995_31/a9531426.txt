Abstract    :
              9531426  Nemser    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project explores a new concept for a self-contained, compact oxygen-enriching
              membrane module that can enhance net peak power of electric vehicle fuel cell
              (EVFC) stacks by at least 25%.  By both simulation and fuel cell tests, Phase I
              confirmed feasibility of 30-38% oxygen enriched air can improve net peak power
              (over 35%) compared to gains achieved by conventional pressurization (12%). 
              Cruising efficiency was also found to be improved.  Phase II will pursue
              demonstration of the technology with tests on a 10kw utility vehicle and the
              effects of higher operating temperatures and increased oxygen levels   
              Potential commercial application of this technology will be in on-board fuel
              cell power packs for the next generation electric vehicle.  It may also find
              use: 1) on conventional cars and trucks for enhanced engine power and less
              pollution; and 2) in enhanced breathing apparatus for patients with respiratory
              ailments.
