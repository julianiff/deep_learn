Abstract    :
              CTS-9531784  Renato Bautista  United Engineering Trustees, Inc.     The
              conference on "Emerging Separation Technologies for Metals II" is organized by
              the Engineering Foundation.  The meeting will take place in Kona, Hawaii from
              June 16-21, 1996, and focus on the separation of metals.  Technical sessions
              will address both the fundamentals and engineering applications.  Specific
              topics include thermodynamics, population balance and reaction engineering of
              metallurgical processes, multi-phase flow with multiple reactions, adsorption
              and extraction using multiple phases, electromagnetic filtration, metal
              extraction and environmental control.  The conference will provide a forum for
              discussion of the emerging technologies in the separation of metals.
