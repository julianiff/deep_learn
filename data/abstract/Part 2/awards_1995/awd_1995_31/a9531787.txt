Abstract    :
              9531787  Mavrovouniotis  This project is aimed at the development and
              implementation  of systematic techniques for the thermodynamic analysis of 
              biochemical reactions and pathways.  This proposal has three  components: (1)
              determination of the standard (biological)  Gibbs energy of formation of any
              biochemical compound from  its structure, based on contributions of groups; (2)
               determination of the standard (biological) Gibbs energy  change and the
              equilibrium constant of a biotransformation,  from groups that occur in the
              metabolites involved; and (3)  a technique that translates thermodynamic
              limitations to  limitations on bioreaction rates, allowing the  interpretation
              of the potential effect of thrmodynamics on  observable parameters.  ***
