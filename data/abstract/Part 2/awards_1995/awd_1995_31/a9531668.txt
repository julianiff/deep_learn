Abstract    :
              9531668    ABSTRACT  (Task Order "A")        This task order with Friday Systems
              Services (FSS) deals  with providing support for the joint NSF/EPA partnership
              activities in the area of technology for a sustainable environment
              (environmental technology).  The primary type of support is in the area of
              developing and maintaining a computer information data base of fundamental
              research projects in NSF and EPA.  There are three major subtasks.  The first
              subtask deals with FSS helping to provide CTS/NSF project inventories in the
              field of fundamental research on environmental technology. List of projects
              supported by NSF and EPA will be prepared A joint NSF/EPA grantees conference
              will be organized and held.    The second subtask involves support for startup
              planning for ETI and/or technology for a sustainable environment activities in
              FY 96.  The third subtask addresses maintaining the data base for the FY 95
              NSF/EPA partnership grants and declinations.  These activities involve a number
              of programs at EPA and a number of divisions within NSF.  Support for this task
              order is provided indirectly by EPA.
