Abstract    :
              9531995  RADTKE    An  X-ray mapping, analytical microprobe technique will be 
              tested to measure Sr/Ca ratios in the otoliths of larval  cod fishes. Success
              with this procedure will identify the  relationships between successive daily
              growth increments,  vertical distribution/diel migration patterns, and 
              hydrographic  structure in  the  water  column.  Specimens  collected from
              Georges  Bank during the spring and early  summer period  when thermal
              stratification  develops  will  provide information that should broaden an
              understanding of  larval transport, survival and recruitment.      ***
