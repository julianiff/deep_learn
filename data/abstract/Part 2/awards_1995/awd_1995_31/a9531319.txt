Abstract    :
                ***  9531319  Ledford         The chemical analysis of mixtures is commonly
              required in chemistry, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental
              science.  If the application demands detection, identification, and
              quantification of more than a very few substances in a mixture, then chemical
              separation is usually required.  Most current methods of separation are either
              very slow or are limited to only a small portion of the mixture.  The objective
              of this proposed research is to develop much faster instrumentation for the
              chemical analysis of moderately complex mixtures.  The method employs two
              independent chemical separations applied in series to a mixture in such a way
              that the whole sample passes through both separations generating a separation
              in two-dimensions rather than one.  The second of the two separations operates
              so quickly that it can be applied repeatedly to each small portion of the
              mixture emerging from the first separation.  This method, comprehensive
              two-dimensional gas chromatography, has been demonstrated in the research
              laboratory.      This research project will develop a rugged instrument for
              commercial application.  The instrument will detect, identify, and quantitate
              volatile organic substances in mixtures containing about one hundred components
              within five minutes or less.  ***
