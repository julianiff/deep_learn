Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with two performance enhancing techniques of VLSI 
              systems that have developed from wave pipelining: delay vernier architectures
              and  non-zero skew design methodologies.  Many high performance applications
              require  extremely fine timing resolution or very high data sampling rates. 
              Examples  include high speed network transceivers, A/D converters, phase-locked
              and delay-  locked and delay-locked loops, and ATE pin electronics.  Normally,
              expensive  circuit technologies and very high frequency clock signals are used
              to satisfy  these performance requirements.  However, the proposed delay
              vernier structures  are capable of achieving a very high time resolution using
              CMOS technologies and  relatively slow clock signals.  This research will focus
              on refining and  extending delay vernier architectures and design techniques so
              that their  usefulness is maximized.  The effectiveness of the architecture in
              a number of  applications will be evaluated.  Also, some real-world factors,
              such as process  variation and noise, will be investigated.  The non-zero skew
              design approach  allows the VLSI systems designer to take advantage of
              intentional skew to  optimize clock distribution for a particular set of
              propagation delays, and  thereby greatly improve system throughput.  A critical
              necessity for these  systems in the ability to create precise clock skews. 
              This research will focus  very strongly on the delay vernier technique, since
              it can provide this required  ability.  Finally, prototypes systems will be
              built for several promising  applications.
