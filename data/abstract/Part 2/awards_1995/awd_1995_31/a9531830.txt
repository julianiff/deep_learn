Abstract    :
              9531830  PI: Saeks    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will develop an integrated hierarchical neurocontrol system for a 4 motor / 4
              wheel drive Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV).  To achieve this goal a hierarchical
              neurocontroller will be developed for, the HEV's energy subsystem, and a
              vehicle management system will be designed to generate commands for the energy
              and vehicle control systems from driver input.  The systems will be integrated
              with the vehicle control system developed under Phase I into a graphical
              vehicle simulator which will be used to evaluate the performance of the
              proposed neurocontrol system.  Finally, these designs will be incorporated into
              a preliminary design for a Phase II road test vehicle.  This will result in the
              design of a three level hierarchical neurocontrol system for a 4 motor / 4
              wheel drive Hybrid Electric Vehicle, and will set the stage for a Phase III
              road test program and the commercialization of the proposed neurocontrol
              system.   By virtue of its elimination of "all" drive train components, the 4
              motor / 4 wheel drive HEV is ideally positioned to realize a three fold
              efficiency goal for a NGV.  To realize the potential of this class of vehicle,
              a high performance control system is required.  The successful completion of
              the proposed program will therefore lay the foundation for the development of
              the coming generation of HEV's by the U.S. automotive industry.
