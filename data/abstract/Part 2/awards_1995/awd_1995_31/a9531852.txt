Abstract    :
              9531852    Chassignet    This project is a contribution to the modeling
              component to be   carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate  
              Experiment (ACCE) under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment   (WOCE).  The
              focus will be on upgrading existing isopycnal models,   data assimilation, and
              integrating different types of regional   models.  Comparisons will be made
              among different modeling approaches   in order to assess the strngths and
              weaknesses of each, and to   determine the best overall approach for including
              ocean variability   in climate modeling.  Particular attention will be paid to 
               assimilating, into the models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as   well as
              from historical data bases.  In this particular project, the   PI will
              investigate the sensitivity of the North Atlantic meridional   overturning
              circulation to changes in forcing and boundary conditions   in a series of
              numerical experiments using the Miami Isopycnic   Coordinate Ocean Model
              (MICOM).  Specific applications will be made   to seasonal and decadal
              variability.
