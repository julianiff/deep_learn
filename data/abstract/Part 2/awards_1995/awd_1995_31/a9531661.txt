Abstract    :
                9531661  Furey  Triboemission particles emitted from sliding ceramic pairs 
              will be measured and characterized by type and amount as  functions of time,
              applied load, velocity, ambient  atmosphere, and the presence of various
              compounds.  Their  possible role in the formation of tribopolymers will be 
              evaluated theoretically and confirmed experimentally through  tests with
              various addition-type monomers in the sliding  contact zone, followed by
              examination of the wear scars and  the surrounding surface by surface
              analytical techniques.  ***
