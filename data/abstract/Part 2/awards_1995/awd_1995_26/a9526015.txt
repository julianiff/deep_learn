Abstract    :
              9526015  Brett    The workshop will bring together leading regional and state
              user  services groups to discuss the feasibility of leveraging their 
              individual activities into a coherent national effort. The purpose  of the
              Coalition would be to develop and provide systematic  training and support for

              identify schools and teachers  in different parts of the country (and the
              world) capable of and  interested in participating in collaborative projects.  
              The  workshop involves planning of future NSF support for the  development of a
              training infrastructure in this important are.
