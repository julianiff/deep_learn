Abstract    :
              The microbial loop has been shown to play an important role in marine and
              freshwater plankton  ecosystems in all climatic zones. Earlier research in two
              contrasting habitats: an Antarctic coastal/  shelf/oceanic ecosystem and a
              subtropical oceanic ecosystem, have shown significant differences in the 
              ecological role of the microbial loop and the physiology of bacterioplankton.
              These two habitats are  isolated from input of terrestrially derived organic
              matter and so provide excellent opportunities to  study bacterial metabolism of
              autochthonous organic matter of phytoplankton origin. Strong contrasts  in
              plankton community parameters make these two sites ideal for this comparison.
              This study will be  embedded within on-going programs at each of these two
              sites (US-JGOFS Hawaii Ocean Time-series in the North Pacific and Palmer LTER
              in Antarctica) that provide both logistical support and supporting data on a
              wide range of hydrographic, chemical and biological parameters, with extensive
              documentation of spatial and temporal variation. Preliminary field results show
              that bacterial communities in th ese  two areas are physiologically distinct,
              that bacterial physiology is regulated by the structure of the  microbial
              community and particularly by grazer recycling of nitrogen, that organic
              compounds rare in  seawater, especially histidine, play a large role in
              regulation of bacterial ectoenzyme expression,  and that photolysis of
              dissolved organic matter by solar ultraviolet radiation also plays a role in 
              regulation of bacterial ectoenzymes. More thorough investigation of these
              phenomena in ecologically  distinct microbial communities will facilitate
              understanding of the complex interactions between  bacterioplankton and the
              rest of the microbial community.
