Abstract    :
              Shaul Mukamel is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in the area of   molecular
              relaxation and radiative processes.  He is applying Liouville   space Green
              function techniques to the interpretation of a variety of   nonlinear optical
              and spectroscopic phenomena in liquid phase systems.     A number of
              applications are being considered including: 1) high-order   echoes in
              vibrational spectroscopy of liquids; 2) multidimensional   spectral density and
              the Kramers-Kronig representation of optical   response; 3) semiclassical
              simulation of nonlinear response functions;   and 4) a many body Green function
              approach to cooperative radiative   dynamics of confined excitons in clusters
              and nanostructures.  The   theoretical research is being used to assist in the
              interpretation of   experimental spectroscopic data.  Ultrafast spectroscopy
              has capitalized on major technological innovations   in optics and electronics
              to enable scientists to interrogate molecular   motions on the subpicosecond
              level.  This has provided chemists with new   ways of studying fundamental
              molecular processes on the time scale of a   chemical reaction.  Mukamel's
              research provides the necessary theoretical   interpretation of the
              experimental observations.
