Abstract    :
              9526877  Lesher  Funds are requested for a 1 year pilot project to prove the
              concept that magmatic amphiboles in komatiitic, ferropicritic, and tholeiitic
              flows and sills in the Archean Abitibi-Pontiac region of the Superior Province,
              Canada, and in the lower Proterozoic Cape Smith fold belt of the
              Circum-Superior Belt, Canada, can be used to constrain the H2O contents of the
              parental melts form which they formed and the ultimate source of the H2O.  The
              project will involve:  1) detailed petrographic analysis of  magmatic amphibole
              in peridotites, pyroxenites, and gabbros from mafic and ultramafic flows and
              sills;  2) detailed chemical analysis of magmatic amphibole and, if possible,
              other hydromagmatic phases such as phlogopite and apatite for major an minor
              trace elements (including Cl and F) in selected samples by electron microprobe
              at the University of Alabama; 3) analysis of high-purity amphibole separates
              for O and H isotopic composition by mass spectrometry at Indiana University; 4)
              analysis of carefully selected amphibole grains in situ for H isotopes by ion
              microprobe at the Centre de Recherches Petrographiques et Geochimiques, Nancy.
