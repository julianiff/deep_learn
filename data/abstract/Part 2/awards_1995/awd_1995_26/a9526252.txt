Abstract    :
              Feldmann  OPP 9526252    Abstract  This award supports a study of fossil crabs
              and lobsters from the  southern hemisphere with the goal of understanding the 
              paleobiogephraphic framework of these fossils compared to  molluscs and
              foraminifera.  Field work and laboratory analysis of  fossil crabs and lobsters
              from Antarctica and other high latitude  sites in the southern hemisphere has
              now provided a robust data  base from which the pattern of paleobiogeographic
              distribution  can be discerned.  Recent field work, supported by the National 
              Science Foundation, has resulted in the collection of several new  faunas which
              more narrowly constrain the northern influence of  Antarctic fossil biotas than
              has been possible previously.  Laboratory analysis of these faunas coupled with
              examination of  significant museum fossil collections made by other workers in 
              Madagascar and on Alexander Island, Antarctica, will assure that  the principal
              investigator will have examined and confirmed the  identification of all known
              decapods from the mid and high  southern latitudes.  As a result, knowledge of
              these organisms  will be great enough to synthesize their geologic history and 
              evolution which, in turn, will make it possible to test the  paleobiogeographic
              framework of these animals against models  based upon the more commonly
              preserved molluscs and  microorganisms.
