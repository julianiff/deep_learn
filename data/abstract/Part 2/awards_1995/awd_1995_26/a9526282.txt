Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate the persistence of enhanced ammonia in the  jovian
              stratosphere.  Their observations of Jupiter derive vertical  and horizontal
              distributions for ammonia.  In addition, they will  complete the radiative
              transfer analysis of the hydrogen cyanide  images.  The vertical distributions
              derived will be compared with  ammonia and carbon, two molecules of different
              impact-induced  origin.  The horizontal coverage will be compared to the dust 
              observed to investigate whether the particles were coupled with the  gas in the
              dynamics following the impact.  Finally, their re-  observation of Jupiter will
              be to image hydrogen cyanide, which is  stable for over a year, and therefore a
              good tracer of atmospheric  dynamics.***
