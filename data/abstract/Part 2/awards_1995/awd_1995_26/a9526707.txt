Abstract    :
              This award is for support to develop a time dependent analytical  theory of
              three-dimensional glacier flow perturbations caused by  small bedrock
              undulations and/or variation in basal resistance.  The theory will be used to
              analyze data from the Siple Coast ice  streams.  The main objectives of the
              work will be: 1) to  elucidate the cause of a number of observed surface
              undulations  and local variation in the surface velocity field of Ice Stream 
              D, and 2) to analyze theoretically the time scales associated  with the buildup
              and decay of surface undulations and to test  those theoretical concepts
              against measurements of surface and  bedrock undulations from Ice Stream C. 
              These objectives  contribute to understanding how spatial variations in
              topography  and resistance to slipping contribute to the support of the ice 
              streams, the control of their speeds and their influence on  changes in
              discharge from the West Antarctic ice sheet to the  ocean.  This work will be
              done in conjunction with NASA- Goddard  Space Flight Center (Robert A.
              Bindschadler).
