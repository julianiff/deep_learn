Abstract    :
              9526029  McNeil  For both older and newer cities, brownfields industrial  sites
              which are often vacant because they do not meet the  strict remediation
              requirements of the Superfund law, are  both a resource and a liability. 
              Brownfield sites represent  an opportunity to build the tax base and rejuvenate
              decaying  infrastructure and depressed communities.  With ever  increasing
              pressures on existing infrastructure from both  development and age, and the
              opportunities for more rational  approaches to site redemption, brownfields and
              their  associated infrastructure offer an attractive alternative to  greenfield
              sites.  Particularly since increasing  restrictions and public opposition to
              greenfield development  slows down the development process. The
              interdisciplinary  three year research program addresses the implications of 
              brownfield development for urban infrastructure and the  impact of urban
              infrastructure on brownfield development.  The research will focus on
              information management and  rational decision making using the City of
              Pittsburgh as a  case study.  ***
