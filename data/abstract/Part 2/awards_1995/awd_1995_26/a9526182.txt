Abstract    :
              EEC-9526182  Datye    This award funds a collaborative research effort between
              the Industry University Cooperative Research Center at the University of New
              Mexico on Microengineered Ceramics and the Industry University Cooperative
              Research Center at Lehigh University on Polymer Interfaces.  The overall
              objective of this collaborative research is to gain a better understanding of
              the interfaces between particulates (ceramics at New Mexico and rubber at
              Lehigh) and epoxy polymers in order to control the thermal conductivity and
              fracture toughness of the resulting composite materials.  The University of New
              Mexico Center is investigating  boron nitride particulate surfaces, and the
              Lehigh University Center is investigating the effects of epoxy polymer
              chemistry and rubber surface characteristics on the interface between the boron
              nitride and rubber particulates and the epoxy resins.  The two centers are
              cooperating in the processing and characterization of both the particulates and
              the composites that are produced.  The physical and thermal properties of the
              composites are also being evaluated.
