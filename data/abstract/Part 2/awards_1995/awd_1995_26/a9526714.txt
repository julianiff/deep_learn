Abstract    :
              9526714  Banner    The proposed research will investigate how a limestone
              aquifer evolves through time.  Barbados's uplifted coral-reef terraces comprise
              a 10-km scale meteoric groundwater flow systems with unique stratigraphic,
              lithologic, and hydrologic properties that are ideally suited to understanding
              the pathways and time scales of groundwater flow and fluid-rock interaction. 
              These unique properties include (I) variations in aquifer-rock composition,
              mineralogy and age, soil composition, and porosity-permeability that all vary
              in predictable patterns within and between tectonically-uplifed groundwater
              catchments: (ii) access to water, rock, mineral, and soil samples from
              densely-spaced wells, springs and caves; and (iii) the 0 to 1 million year time
              scale within which the aquifer's evolution can be studied using newly-developed
              isotope techniques.  To reconstruct the aquifer's Pleistocene-Holocene-modern
              evolution, samples will be taken of groundwater, limestones, and soils from the
              modern flow system, and carbonate minerals that grew as speleothems and cements
              in the pore spaces of the limestones during groundwater flow in the Pleistocene
              and Holocene epochs.  Recently developed and conventional isotopic techniques
              (e.g., 238U-234U-230Th, 87Sr/86 Sr,   13C/12C,  18O/16O, 15N/14N) will be used
              in order to determine 1) the ages of growth zones in the speleothems and
              cements, 2) the sources of dissolved ions in the modern groundwaters and in the
              groundwaters from which the cements grew, and 3) temporal variations in the
              sources of dissolved ions for the groundwaters during the past million years. 
              In determining high-resolution temporal variations in the sources of dissolved
              ion in an active, well-constrained groundwater flow systems, this study  will
              be unprecedented.  An initial study of a stalagmite provides a time series
              record for the past 5500 years.  Sr isotope variations in groundwater recorded
              in the calcite growth layers of this sample reflect changes in the amount of
              rainfall tha t recharged the Pleistocene limestone aquifer during the mid to
              late Holocene,  Similar records will be constructed for other parts of the
              aquifer and over extended temporal scales.  These will be integrated with a
              detailed study of the modern flow system.  The petrologic, geochemical,
              geochronologic, and hydrologic analysis of this aquifer will improve our
              understanding of (I) the controls of karsification patterns, porosity, aquifer
              rock mineralogy, soil development, and climate change on groundwater migration
              and chemical evolution, and (ii) the impact of industrial and agricultural
              pollution on groundwater quality.  Such data on the rates of groundwater
              evolution represent an important step toward developing predictive models for
              the development of carbonate aquifers.
