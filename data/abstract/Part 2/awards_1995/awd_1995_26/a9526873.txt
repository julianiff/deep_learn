Abstract    :
              9526873  Nabelek    This research is to use the stacking of globe-circling
              surface  waves from very large earthquakes to eliminate the effects of  varying
              velocity structure along the path and isolate the source  time history of the
              earthquake.  This technique is most effective  in the surface-wave periods of
              140 to 550 seconds.  These low-  frequency estimates can be combined with
              high-frequency estimates  from body wave modeling to produce a broadband
              description of the  earthquake source.  The technique will be applied to very
              large  earthquakes recorded digitially since 1977, and a select number of 
              earlier events of special interest including the 1989 Macquarie  Ridge
              earthquake which has been difficult to understand as yet.   Special emphasis
              will be on the search for long-period precursory  fault slip prior to the
              earthquake onset.  This research is a  component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
