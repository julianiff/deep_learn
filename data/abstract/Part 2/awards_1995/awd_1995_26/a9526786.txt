Abstract    :
              9526786  Frazer   This research is to develop the theory for determining the
              speeds of P- and SV- waves in a solid containing plane-parallel fractures.  The
              fracture separation is random in accordance with a specified probability
              density function, and the fracture compliances are also random in accordance
              with another specified probability density function.  Prior results for SH, now
              in press, suggest that the project is feasible.  Three new methods were
              developed for SH, and they all agree with each other; the goal is to generalize
              these three methods to the PSV problem.  The results have application to the
              inversion for seismic velocity structure in plane-parallel fractured media, a
              situation that is widely applicable to the crust of the earth, particularly in
              the context of secondary and tertiary recovery of oil and gas, and in
              geothermal operations.
