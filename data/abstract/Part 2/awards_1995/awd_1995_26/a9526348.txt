Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program of research involving the  use of
              inverse modeling to derive information from the measured  configuration of an
              ice sheet to yield important information  about the conditions both at the bed
              and within the ice column.  It is proposed to convert a column-averaged model
              to a column-  integrated model that accounts explicitly for internal 
              thermodynamics and variations of material properties that depend  on this
              internal temperature field.  An existing finite-element 3-  D temperature
              solver will be coupled with an existing finite-  element map-plane continuity
              solver.  The result will allow more  detailed analysis of existing field data
              within the context of  the assumptions of the model.  This improved model will
              be used  to derive quantities describing the basal conditions of the  Antarctic
              ice sheet, with particular focus on the behavior of ice  streams around the
              margin of the continent.
