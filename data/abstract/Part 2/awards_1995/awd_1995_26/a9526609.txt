Abstract    :
              9526609  Salters  The research will investigate which of the two processes that
              explains the high 176Hf/177Hf  at Salt Lake Crater, Hawaii, is the most
              plausible.  In addition to the Hf and Nd isotope analyses, the P.I. will
              analyze the mineral phases of the peridotites for their trace element content. 
              The P.I. intends to either use existing data or otherwise obtain full major and
              trace element analyses on all the xenoliths.  The specific peridotite samples
              that are proposed to be analyzed include:   set of Hawaiian anhydrous spinel
              lherzolites, including LREE depleted xenoliths; continental peridotites from
              Kilbourne Hole, Potrillo Maar, San Carlos, and the Colorado Plateau;  the P.I.
              will also try to initiate a study on the peridotites from the southern part of
              the Siberian Plateau, Vitim and Bartoy localities; in collaboration with E.
              Hauri and J. Natland the P.I>  will analyze peridotites from the Austral Island
              and the Marquesas.  In Addition the P.I. will analyze a limited number of MORB
              for either Pb or Hf to determine whether a correlation exist between Hf and Pb
              isotopes in MORB.  Obtaining the above analyses should increase our knowledge
              of the space and time relationships between the different components within the
              mantle.
