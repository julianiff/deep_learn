Abstract    :
              # ATM-9526209  Yung   A one-year feasibility study is proposed which is aimed at
              improving the knowledge and understanding of HOx in the stratosphere and
              mesosphere and ozone in the troposphere. The program consists of two elements:
              retrieval of the integrated vertical column of OH and tropospheric ozone
              measured by ground-based high resolution UV-visible spectroscopy, and modeling
              of the temporal variations in the observed quantities.   The (independently
              funded) spectroscopic measurements will be performed at JPL's Table Mountain
              Observatory using direct solar absorption for OH and zenith solar scattering
              for O3. The model calculations will be performed using the Caltech-JPL
              one-dimensional photochemical model. The observed diurnal and seasonal
              variability of the OH column density will be compared with model calculations
              to test our understanding of HOx kinetics and photochemistry and the spatial
              and temporal distributions of other stratospheric species that affect the HOx
              budget.
