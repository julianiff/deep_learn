Abstract    :
              Everett  9526651   Constraints on the large-scale structure of Earth's upper
              mantle from global seismic tomography, plate motion reconstructions, and
              regional tomographic studies on the fate of subducting slabs influence our view
              of convection in the planet.  The evidence supports large-scale, volumetric
              lateral heterogeneity in the upper mantle, in addition to internal
              discontinuities at 410 and 660 km.    Long-period electromagnetic induction
              data from the worldwide magnetic observatory network can resolve large-scale
              lateral variations in mantle structure.  The PI proposes to develop and apply a
              spherical 3-d inversion scheme for imaging lateral variations in upper mantle
              conductivity of the earth.  The inversion will be based on the PI's recently
              developed spherical finite element code. Using the inversion code, and
              constrains from other geophysical techniques, the PI proposes to 1) test the
              hypothesis that long period global induction data are consistent with upper
              mantle seismic tomographic results, 2) develop a regularization algorithm and
              invert the global induction data set for the three-dimensional electrical
              conductivity structure of the upper mantle, and 3) incorporate galvanic and
              oceanic effects into the existing forward model of electromagnetic induction in
              a heterogeneous sphere.  The proposed work is likely to lead to useful progress
              on 3-d modeling and interpretation of mantle conductivity variations and
              provide independent constraints on mantle dynamics.
