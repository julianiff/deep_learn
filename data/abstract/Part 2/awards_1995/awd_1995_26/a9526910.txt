Abstract    :
              Paul Segall  95-26910    The PIs propose to continue ongoing GPS studies in
              northern California aimed at understanding the kinematics of crustal
              deformation across the Pacific-North America plate boundary, and at
              investigating the accumulation of interseismic strain and the time-dependent
              variations in strain along the San Andreas Fault system.  The PIs will combine
              (new and existing) GPS data with measurements using VLBI and EDM techniques  to
              obtain a self-consistent velocity field for the region.  Ultimately the PIs
              will incorporate their results into deformation models that can be useful in
              assessing seismic hazards in this important region.
