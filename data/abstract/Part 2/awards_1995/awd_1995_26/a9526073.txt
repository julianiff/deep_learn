Abstract    :
              9552596  Davis    The Virgin Islands (VI) Department of Education proposes to 
              formalize and extend initial reform planning activities begun  under the
              Governor's Initiative on Science & Technology, which  resulted in a variety of
              programmatic initiatives focused on  curriculum, teachers, technology and lab
              equipment.     There is ample evidence of the need for comprehensive reform  of
              k-12 education in VI: (1) there is only one university, and  80% of the
              students are admitted with deficiencies in  mathematics and science; (2)
              "virtually all standard  instruments used to measure student achievement in VI
              indicate  that the students are performing poorly."  Compounding the  problem,
              43% of the 22,000 K-12 students live in poverty; 70%  are eligible to receive a
              free lunch, and 1/3 live in single  parent homes.      A one-year self-study
              grant is proposed.  Expected outcomes  include a full implementation proposal
              for systemic reform.   The goal of the VI Systemic Initiative will be to
              improve the  educational system while developing local science and  technology
              talent to insure the economic survival of the  islands.  This includes the
              development of the teacher and  administrative workforce and students; revision
              of education  policies (curriculum; certification); the creation of a  student
              assessment program, a communications system and  precollege programs.  ***
