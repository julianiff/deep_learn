Abstract    :
              9526231  Schwartz    The proposed research integrates synthesis, microstructural
               characterization, and superconducting properties  characterization to explore
              the critical influence of a  metallic interface on the HgBa2Can-1CunOx system,
              the  superconducting oxide system with highest critical  temperature yet
              achieved.  The project objectives include  identifying chemically compatible
              metallic substrates,  understanding and controlling interfacial reactions, 
              understanding the influencing factors for microstructural  development of the
              superconducting and competing non-  superconducting phases (including texture),
              and  understanding the microstructure/superconducting properties 
              relationships, including flux pinning and weak links.  Synthesis studies will
              employ a two-zone assembly that  allows for independent control of the mercury
              pressure and  the annealing temperature.   Tapes will be cast on metallic 
              substrates.  Thermal processing, atmosphere, stoichiometry,  and substrate
              metal are important variables.   The samples  will be characterized using a
              variety of techniques.  %%%  The project addresses the underlying scientific
              issues for  applications of the HgBa2Can-1 CunOx superconducting oxides.  A
              deeper understanding of the relationships between metallic  interfaces,
              microstructure, and properties of high  temperature superconductors will
              result.  ***
