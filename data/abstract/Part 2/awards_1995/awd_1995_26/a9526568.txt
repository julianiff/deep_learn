Abstract    :
              Strother  9526568   Evidence from fossil spores indicates that land-dwelling
              plants probably originated during the Ordovician and diversified throughout the
              Silurian.  This transition in Earth history had profound consequences for all
              subsequently evolving terrestrial organisms, yet we really know very little
              about the origin and primary radiation of the land plants.  The proposal is
              designed to document and substantiate the presence of land plants throughout
              the Silurian of the central Appalachian Basin.  Such evidence consists fo
              sporomorphs (cryptospores and trilete spores), microscmpic plant fragments, and
              macroscopic plant thalli.  The proposed work involves field collection, sample
              extraction and preparation, microscopic examination, description, and
              comparison similar remains known from Europe and Canada.  Computer-based
              techniques in the analsis and description of fossil spores and plant remains
              will developed and applied for the first time to fossil spore studies.  Results
              of this research will provide the broader scientific community with basic facts
              about the origin and early evolution of terrestrial ecosystems.  Specialists
              will benefit from the systematics and documentation of the plant fossil record
              during a period of initial adaptive responses to the terrestrial habitat.
