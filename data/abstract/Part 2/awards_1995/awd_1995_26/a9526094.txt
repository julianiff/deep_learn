Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9526094  "Intelligent Renewal of Urban Wastewater Systems"  PI: 
              Mau, S. T., University of Houston    This research is a three-year
              comprehensive study to be  completed as a  collective effort of scientists
              (political, social, and  natural) and  engineers from the University of
              Houston, officials from the  City of  Houston, and pipeline contractors which
              will develop new  technologies for  the physical renewal of the Greater Houston
              Wastewater  System and produce a  paradigm of policy formulation regarding the
              sharing of  responsibilities  between public and private sectors.    The
              project will study mechanisms of microbially-induced  corrosion, and  quantify
              the rate of deterioration of concrete pipes,  plastic pipes,  plastic linings
              and coatings.  New methods of corrosion  assessment will be  developed based on
              electromagnetic wave technology.  The  research will  identify new evaluation
              methods for the viability of new  coating materials  and plastic linings for
              pipe rehabilitation and new material  mixes to be  used as bedding and backfill
              in placing new pipes.  Physical  and computer  models will also be developed to
              address the problem of air-  hammer in  pipelines that results in environmental
              hazard.    The research will also develop and apply a process which a 
              low-income,  minority, inner-city community can follow to renew its  wastewater
              lines.  The final task is to develop an integrated system and  decision-making 
              methodology for intelligent renewal of wastewater systems.  The technical  and
              non-technical findings of the study, as well as the  methodology for 
              decision-making concerning community responsibilities, will  serve as new 
              paradigms not only for future works in Houston, but also for  similar  programs
              in other urban communities throughout the U.S.
