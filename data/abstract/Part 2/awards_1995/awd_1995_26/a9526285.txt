Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to continue their theoretical study of the observed 
              magnetospheric effects of the comet SL-9/Jupiter impacts.   Recently, they have
              developed a qualitative interpretation of the  mid-latitude aurora in terms of
              an electrodynamic interaction  between the southern-hemisphere ionosphere and
              the conjugate  ionosphere.  Hill will develop a quantitative numerical model of
               this dynamo interaction in order to test its ability to reproduce  the
              observed auroral arc morphology and dynamics.  By perturbing  existing models
              of the electron radiation belt and comparing with  observed frequency-dependent
              recovery of the decimetric emissions,  they will refine information about the
              otherwise unobserved inner  radiation belt of Jupiter.  Finally, they will
              continue  investigating the charging of cometary dust by magnetospheric 
              electrons.***
