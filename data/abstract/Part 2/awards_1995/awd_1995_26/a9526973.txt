Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a one year pilot study to work on  atmospheric
              dusts from ice cores that already exist.  Specifically,  the deep ice cores
              from Byrd Station and a shallow  core (160 m) that was drilled at Siple Dome
              during the 1994/95  field season will be sampled and analyzed.  The objective
              of this  work is to characterize the dust from these ice cores in order to 
              identify, or at least constrain, the continental source areas of  the dust,
              using a suite of chemical and isotopic tracers.  These  tracers include a
              combination of the fine-fraction clay  mineralogy, strontium and neodymium
              isotope compositions and  concentrations, and the rare-earth element patterns. 
              By  analyzing dust from multiple sites, an idea of the compositional 
              variability throughout Antarctica can be determined.
