Abstract    :
              9526243  This action provides support for the U.S. Navy Arctic  Submarine
              Laboratory for baseline and special data  acquisition during an extended
              scientific cruise of a  submarine under the Arctic Ocean ice cover in the
              summer of  1995.  The basis for this support is a Memorandum of  Agreement
              among four operational units of the Navy and  three civilian federal agencies,
              the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological
              Survey, and  the National Science Foundation.  ***
