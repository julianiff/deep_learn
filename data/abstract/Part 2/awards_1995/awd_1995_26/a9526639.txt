Abstract    :
              Herbert  9526639   Recent 40Ar/39Ar dating has validated changes made to the
              Pliocene and Pleistocene portions of the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS)
              by orbital tuning methods.  Because orbital cycles mark off time in
              geologically short increments, they may be used to measure elapsed time between
              events such as magnetic reversals or biostratigraphic datums very precisely. 
              We outline a work plan to improve and refine the Cretaceous and early Paleocene
              portion of the GPTS, an interval which is subject to errors from spreading rate
              changes in the South Atlantic sea-floor template by studying a number of
              DSDP/ODP drill sites of late Cretaceous to early Paleocene age that display
              precessionally (20 kyr repeat time) forced carbonate cycles.  High resolution
              paleomagnetic sampling will be combined with gathering digital time series
              (color reflectance spectrometry) to produce a composite astronomical chronology
              for magnetochrons C33R through C27N (83 Ma to 62 Ma).  The resulting
              improvement in the GPTS will be of use to geodynamicsts, biostratigraphers, and
              paleoceanographers.
