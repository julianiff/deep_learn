Abstract    :
              DeMets   9526419   The PI's propose a GPS project that is designed to measure
              crustal deformation across a network of geodetic monuments spanning that state
              of Jalisco in western Mexico.  The Jalisco region is a volcanically and
              tectonically complex geologic province that overlies the subducting Rivera and
              Cocos plates and exhibits evidence for modern deformation primarily confined to
              three continental rifts.  Their goal is to understand the relative kinematics
              and hence the coupling of the oceanic and continental plates in this regions,
              as well as to test several hypotheses concerning the link between the motions
              of the subducting plates, seafloor features entering the subduction zone, and
              the observed onshore deformation.  These hypotheses have previously been
              untestable due to a lack of reliable observations of the regional strain field.
               With modern GPS technology, the required measurements are now feasible. 
              Observations of Jalisco block velocities with respect to nearby sites on the
              North American plate could also permit us to test the intriguing, but
              speculative hypothesis that rotation of a semi-rigid Jalisco is responsible for
              the observed deformation along its bordering faults.   The October 1996
              unexpected magnitude 7.6 earthquake in this area provides a unique opportunity
              to study the coseismic and postseismic strains in the Jalisco as well.
