              Abstract  ATM-9526136  Tung, Ka Kit  University of Washington  Title: Modeling
              Studies of the International Variability of Large-Scale Waves and Circulation  
                     Previous NSF projects by the PI were concerned with (a) internal
              variability of the large-  scale planetary waves in the extra-tropics, and (b)
              year-to-year variability of the extra-tropical  waves and circulation caused by
              the equatorial QBO.  In the current proposed project, the PI will  model the
              extra-tropical stratosphere in response to (i) specified, variable, observed
              planetary  wave amplitude at the tropopause for a 12-year period and (ii) the
              changing phase of the  equatorial QBO in zonal wind.  The numerical model
              containing the needed ingredients and  mechanisms has already been built and
              tested by Kinnersley and has produced realistic  climatology in waves and
              circulation and realisitic time-dependent evolution for planetary waves  one,
              two and three for the one-year period May 1980 to April 1981.  In the proposed
              project,  the model will be run with the observed tropopause planetary wave
              forcing from 1980 to 1992.   A second cause of year-to-year variability in the
              extratropical stratosphere, which is perhaps the  more important one as far as
              irreversible mixing of tracers and forcing of mean circulation are  concerned,
              is the effect of the phase of equatorial QBO on the propagation and location of
               breaking of planetary waves in the extra-tropical wave-guide.  The mechanism
              was first proposed  by Holton and Tan involving the location of zero-wind
              lines.  A modified mechanism was  proposed by the PI involving the effect of
              the equatorial QBO on the extra-tropical wave-guide  for stationary waves, and
              the effect of the wave-guide changes on the breaking and mixing of the 
              planetary waves.  These mechanisms will be tested in the proposed project.  To
              validate the  hypothesis, the simulated result will be compared with
              observation.  The comparison will involve  zonal mean temperature and zonal
              wind, planetary wave amplitud es, and meridional circulation  as inferred from
              the distribution of tracers.  This research is important because it seeks to 
              advance the understanding of long-term variability of weather- and climate-
              related atmospheric  circulation features.
