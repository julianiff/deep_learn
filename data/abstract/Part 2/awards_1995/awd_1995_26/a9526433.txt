Abstract    :
              9526433  Hooper           This grant provide $119,529 as one-half support of 
              the costs of acquiring computer upgrades to  replace antiquated control systems
              on an X-ray  fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and inductively-  coupled
              plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) as well  as obtaining a new energy dispersive
              spectrometer  with imaging capabilities and new crystals for the  electron
              microprobe at the GeoAnalytical  Laboratory at Washington State University. 
              This  lab is heavily used by members of the earth  sciences community both
              within the Pacific  Northwest and elsewhere.  These upgrades will  allow 
              uninterrupted, high-quality whole rock  analyses for outside users and both the
               continuation of the PI's research on the petrology  and geochemistry of flood
              basalts as well as  multiple and varied graduate and undergraduate  research
              projects.  ***
