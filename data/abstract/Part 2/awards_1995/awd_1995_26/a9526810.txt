Abstract    :
              9526810  Zhao, Dapeng    This research is to investigate the detailed 3-D
              crustal and upper mantle structure and its relationship to the seismotectonics
              of the Kobe, Japan, region.  Data from the January 17, 1995 Kobe earthquake and
              its aftershocks will be used.  Preliminary results show a low velocity zone
              beneath the hypocenter of the earthquake and one of the goals is to investigate
              Poisson's Ratio in this zone to test a model of fluid triggering of the main
              shock.  Deeper upper mantle structure will also be determined to see how deep
              the Philippine Sea plate is penetrating beneath this region.  The results will
              be important for understanding the triggering mechanism and rupture process of
              large earthquakes, and provide a physical framework for understanding the
              relationship between crustal earthquake activity, lateral variation of the
              structure, and subduction and magmatic processes in the deeper areas.  A better
              understanding of these features is important for the log-term seismic hazard
              assessment in this region, and provide useful references to other seismically
              active regions.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***  ??
