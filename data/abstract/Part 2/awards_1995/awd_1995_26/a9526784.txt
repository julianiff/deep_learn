Abstract    :
              9526784  Krogstad  The goal of this project is to understand how basaltic
              infusions into silicic magma chambers affect physical and chemical processes in
              those chambers and influence the subsequent evolution of the mafic and silicic
              magmas.  The research will focus on two Silurian composite plutons (the
              Cadillac Mountain and Gouldsboro intrusions) in the coastal Maine magmatic
              province.  This research will combine detailed field studies, petrography, and
              major-trace-element geochemistry of whole-rock samples with studies of the
              isotopic systematics of Sr and Nd both in whole rock and in feldspar crystals
              from a wide range of rocks.  This research should contribute to our
              understanding of compositional stratification in composite magma chambers and
              the origin of magmatic enclaves, and will provide new insights into the
              possible origins of A-type granites and trondhjemites.
