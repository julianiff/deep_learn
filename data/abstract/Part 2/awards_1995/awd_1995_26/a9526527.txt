Abstract    :
              9526527  Rutherford  The proposed research is to determine the phase equilibria
              for high silica rhyolite beginning with the controls on biotite composition and
              biotite stability. The biotite-alkali feldspar-magnetite equilibrium is
              potentially a powerful tool for determining the pre-eruptive water fugacities,
              but has been of limited use because of the poor constraints on the ferric and
              ferrous iron composition of biotite as a function of pressure, temperature, and
              fluid composition. Two sets of experiments will be performed: (1) annealing
              biotite with alkali feldspar and titaniferous magnetite, and (2) hydrothermal
              experiments on samples from the Bishop and Toba Tuffs, all in the presence of
              mixed fluids (H2O, CO2 , F) of controlled composition. The ferrous/ferric
              composition of biotite will be determined by microtitration and micro x-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy. The O, H and F contents will be determined by ion
              probe and electron microprobe. This research will constrain the stability and
              composition of biotite in high silica rhyolite, calibrate the
              biotite-magnetite-alkali feldspar equilibrium, and apply these results to
              determine the pre-eruptive conditions of the Bishop and Toba magmas.
