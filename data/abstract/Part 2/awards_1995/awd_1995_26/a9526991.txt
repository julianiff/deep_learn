Abstract    :
              9526991  DeCelles   The Sevier fold-thrust belt offers an appropriate place to
              develop the nature of the linkage between the hinterland and frontal parts of
              the orogenic belt, and to estimate such parameters as regional paleoelevation
              and paleotopographic relief.   The problem will be approached using combined
              structural and sedimentological tools including data collected by standard
              methods of basin analysis, seismic and borehole data, surface mapping and
              integration of these data into incrementally retrodeformable, regional cross
              sections.  The resulting restoration will provide information needed to
              understand depositional events in the western interior foreland basin and will
              applicable to the evolution of fold-thrust orogenic wedges in general.
