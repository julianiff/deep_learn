Abstract    :
                Shen, Holbrook, and ten Brink  OPP 9526930    Abstract    The interpretation
              of the stratigraphy of the glaciated  continental shelves and the
              reconstruction of past ice sheet  fluctuations from the stratigraphy require
              understanding of  the relationships among the stratal geometry, glacial and 
              marine sedimentary processes, and ice dynamics.  Previous  work investigated
              the formation of the morphology and the  broad stratal geometry of the
              Antarctic continental shelf  with 2-D structure-imitating models.  Several 
              generalizations were proposed regarding processes that form  the glaciated
              Antarctic shelves and several guidelines were  proposed for the interpretation
              of stratigraphic features.    This award supports work to expand the modeling
              efforts in  three new directions:    1). constructing 3-D models to account for
              the differences    in glacial morphology and stratigraphy between cross-   
              shelf troughs and banks;  2). improving the structure-imitating models and
              developing    process-based models.  We will treat ice advance and    retreat
              as continuous, autoregressive processes instead    of discrete steps in our
              previous models.  In the process-    based models, erosion and deposition will
              be determined    by the velocity of basal ice or the basal shear stress.   
              Glacial erosion and deposition will be coupled with    models of aqueous
              sedimentary processes.  3). making detailed comparison to newly compiled data
              sets    from the Antarctic and the SE Greenland shelves, and in    doing so
              improving our understanding of the stratigraphy    of the glaciated continental
              shelf.    This work is important to understanding the past behavior of ice 
              sheets in both the northern and southern polar regions.
