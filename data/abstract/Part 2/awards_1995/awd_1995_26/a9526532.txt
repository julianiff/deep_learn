Abstract    :
              The mental process of predicting the reasonable consequences of  a  change in
              the design of an artifact is an important step in the  design process.  This
              research addresses issues in developing a  theory of design change.  The
              premise is that the incremental  changing of the geometric design of an
              artifact may be formally  explained by logical and mathematical theories,
              similar to those in  automated planning and simulation systems which are used
              in many  fields.  Topics being investigated are representation of designs, 
              designer intentions, and constraints.  A computational model of the  deductive
              process of changing a design is being developed.  The  model uses frame laws
              and default constraints expressed in the  modal quantificational logic Z. 
              Other work includes exploring  problems of automated deduction of facts in
              three dimensional  geometry, consistency analysis, and developing a taxonomy of
               appropriate engineering design actions and intents.
