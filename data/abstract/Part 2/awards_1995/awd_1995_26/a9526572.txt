Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program of measurements to  improve our
              understanding of the relationship between  formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydrogen
              peroxide (H2O2) in the  atmosphere and the concentrations of the same species
              in  Antarctic snow, firn and ice. This work aims to relate changes in 
              concentrations in the snow, firn and ice to corresponding changes  in
              tropospheric chemistry.  Atmospheric and firn sampling for  formaldehyde and
              hydrogen peroxide at one or more of the WAIS ice  core drilling sites will be
              undertaken and controlled laboratory  studies to estimate thermodynamic and
              rate parameters will be  performed.  In addition, this work will involve
              modeling of  atmosphere-snow exchange processes to infer the "transfer 
              function" for reactive species at the sites and atmospheric  photochemical
              modeling to relate changes in concentrations of  formaldehyde and hydrogen
              peroxide in snow, firn and ice to  atmospheric oxidation capacity.  This work
              will contribute to a  better understanding of the relationship between
              atmospheric  concentrations of various species and those same species measured 
              in snow and ice samples.
