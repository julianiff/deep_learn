Abstract    :
              9526056  Haimes  Floods produce every year escalating losses that impact the 
              economic and environmental well-being of important regions  of the Nation. 
              Protecting against these natural disasters  is the goal of the project by which
              a model will be  developed that will improve the accounting, in a systems- 
              engineering framework, for: a) the significant coupling in  the performance of
              distributed flood-control structures,  including non-structural measures; b)
              the costs, risk and  benefits of the flood-control systems evaluated over many 
              years and for multiple events; c) the potential evolution of  economic
              development and physical conditions affecting the  performance of the system;
              and d) the multiple and often  conflicting objectives will incorporate data
              from floods  occurred in the Mississippi River basin and will benefit the 
              assessment of risk, and the design and implementation of  sustainable flood
              mitigation measures.  ***
