Abstract    :
              9526673  Hall  This project applies newly refined 40Ar/39Ar dating techniques to
              the problem of dating large scale hydrothermal systems.  Recent improvements in
              the 40Ar/39Ar method have demonstrated the  potential for this technique to
              handle even the finest-grained material.  This project will concentrate on five
              study areas:  a) the Cerro Colorado porphyry copper deposit, Panama; b)
              Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposits with pre-existing Rb-Sr age information;
              c) sediment-hosted micron gold deposits, Nevada (Twin Creeks); d) the Almaden
              mercury district, Spain; e) the Tsumeb-Kombat chimney deposits, Namibia. 
              Samples for all five sites have been collected.  The Cerro Colorado deposit is
              associated with coarse-grained minerals which have already been dated using
              K-Ar, and this will provide a good test for the ages derived from fine-grained
              alteration products.  The MVT deposits have high quality Rb-Sr ages already
              available, thus providing a further test of the system.  The remaining three
              sites have arrange of existing ages with very little consensus as to the timing
              of the hydrothermal activity.  It is with these sites that the project should
              provide the greatest amount of new information.
