Abstract    :
              DMS-9526185  PI: Kenig    This award will give partial support for a conference
              on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations to be held in Chicago
              in February, 1996.  The symbiosis of these two subjects and their applications
              to other branches of mathematics will be emphasized.  Implications of the
              scientific program of Calder n for contemporary and future mathematical
              developments will be the principle theme.    Goals of the conference are to
              spark new developments in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations
              through the interaction of leading researchers having diverse interests, to
              educate young researchers and advanced graduate students on these two fields
              and their interrelationship, and to encourage and facilitate greater
              participation by minorities and members of underrepresented groups in
              mathematical research.
