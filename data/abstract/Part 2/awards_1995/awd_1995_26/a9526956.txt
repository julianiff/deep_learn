Abstract    :
              9526956  Neal    This grant awards $80,000 as two years partial support of the
              costs  of an equipment upgrade and a graduate student to develop laser 
              ablation, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)  as a
              routine analytical tool for direct determination of trace  element abundance in
              geological samples at the micro-scale.  The  work entails an upgrade to their
              current IR laser ablation torch to  include shorter wavelengths including green
              and ultra-violet light,  and will examine the influence of laser wavelength on
              the need for  matrix matching of samples with external standards.  ***
