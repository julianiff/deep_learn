Abstract    :
              9526278  Blumenfeld       In this proposal, Professor Blumenfeld requests
              support  for participation of his group at Johns Hopkins in the NOMAD 
              experiment at CERN.  This experiment is a search for  neutrino oscillations in
              which a muon neutrino converts to a  tau neutrino.  The experiment is sensitive
              in a mass region  that is important in cosmilogical models.  ***
