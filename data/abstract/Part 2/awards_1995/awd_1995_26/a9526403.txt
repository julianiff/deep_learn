Abstract    :
              9526403  Grew  The proposed research is to study the mineralogy and petrology of
              certain carriers of boron in order to assess their role in the behavior of
              boron during high-grade metamorphism, migmatism and anatexis.  The carriers to
              be studied include tourmaline, muscovite, sillimanite, kornerupine,
              grandidierite, and werdingite in metapelites in Western Maine.  Special
              emphasis will be on assessing the role of aqueous fluid and anatectic melt in
              removing boron released by tourmaline breakdown.  major element compositions
              will be determined by electron microprobe, Fe+2 and Fe+3 by Mossbauer
              spectroscopy, H in bulk samples by uranium extraction, H zoning by 15N
              reaction, bulk and microscopic B, Li and F microscopic measurements by ion
              microprobe.  Results from this study will provide a detailed understanding of
              the B budget during high-grade metamorphism and provide important insights into
              the processes by which crystalline terranes are formed.
