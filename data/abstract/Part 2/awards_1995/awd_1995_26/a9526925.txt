Abstract    :
              Kohlstedt  9526925   An experimental investigation of three central issues in
              upper mantle rheology is proposed: (I) the dependence of viscosity on water
              concentration, (ii) the dependence of creep behavior on mineralogy and (iii)
              the dependence of creep rate on pressure.   The proposed experiments are
              designed to gain a basic physical understanding of the roles of water,
              mineralogy and pressure on the flow behavior of mantle rocks.  An important
              goal of this research is to determine quantitative constitutive equations for
              plastic flow that permit reliable extrapolation of laboratory results to upper
              mantle environments.
