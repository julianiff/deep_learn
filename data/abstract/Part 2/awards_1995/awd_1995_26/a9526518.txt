Abstract    :
              9526518  Coleman   This award provides support for a workshop on "Introduction
              of High Performance Computing in Undergraduate Computing Programs" to be held
              at the 1995 ADMI meeting.  The annual ADMI meeting brings together faculty from
              a large number of minority institutions.  The goal of this workshop is to
              provided participants with a comprehensive overview of computational science
              curricula and hands-on experience with the use of the Internet and HPCC shared
              resources.  The workshop program includes a series of lectures by experts in
              the field, discussion of possible curricula implementations, and demonstrations
              and hands-on experiences in the use of the Internet, Netscape, and the World
              Wide Web.  ***
