Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program of glaciochemical  analyses of shallow
              and deep ice cores from Siple Dome, West  Antarctica.  Measurements that have
              been proposed include  chloride, nitrate, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, 
              potassium, ammonium and methansulfonic acid.  These measurements  will provide
              information about past volcanic events, biomass  source strength,  sea ice
              fluctuations, atmospheric circulation,  changes in ice-free areas and the
              environmental response to Earth  orbit insolation changes and solar
              variability.  The  glaciochemical records from the Siple Dome core will be
              developed  at a resolution sufficient to compare with the Summit, Greenland 
              record, thus allowing a bipolar comparison of climate change  event timing and
              magnitude.  As part of this award, an  international workshop will be held
              during the first year to  formulate a science plan for the International
              Transantarctic  Scientific Expedition (ITASE), a program of regional surveys 
              documenting the spatial distribution of properties measured in  ice cores .
