Abstract    :
              9526659  Hodges       The process of extensional deformation within orogenic 
              belts is of considerable interest in the development of  collisional mountain
              ranges.  First well-documented in the  Himalaya, these extensional structures
              appear to provide a  mechanism for limiting the topographic relief and mean 
              elevation when physical erosion is not sufficient to  compensate for the
              compression-drives uplift.  Commonly  associated with these extensional
              features is an enigmatic  metamorphic relationship in which the metamorphic
              grade is  inverted, that is, increases upward.  From thermal modeling  it is
              clear that these inverted metamorphic gradients can  only be preserved with
              rapid cooling.   However, the  temporal spatial and mechanical relationships
              between  deformation (compression with extensional unroofing  accommodation)
              and the geothermal budget (Metamorphic grade  and pressure-temperature-time
              path) of these systems is not  well understood.  This project will study
              tectonic  denudation and inverted metamorphism in the East Greenland 
              Caledonides.   This area exposes a much deeper part of an  Orogen, and the
              inverted metamorphic gradient is present in  a different structural setting
              from analogous structures in  the Himalaya.  Technically, the high-precision 
              geochronologic techniques to be used are capable of more  closely tying
              deformation metamorphism in this older orogen.  The expected results of this
              research include a better  understanding of the thermal behavior of actively
              deforming  orogens, particularly in response to episode of extension in  the
              overall compressional orogens.
