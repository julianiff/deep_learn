              Connelly  Deep crustal features associated with continent-continent collisions
              are difficult to study in most phanerozoic orogens because the exposure levels
              are seldom deep enough.  The Nagssugtoqidian Orogen of west Greenland has
              attracted much attention as one of the worlds most completely exposed
              foreland-to-foreland transects of a deep precambrian Orogen.  However, recent
              work has failed to confirm the presence of major displacement, crustal-scale
              shear zones and thrusts anywhere in the orogen that should mark a
              continent-continent suture.  This project, in conjunction with the Danish
              Lithosphere Centre, will attempt to date, characterize and interpret
              metamorphism of this belt, previously thought to be a type example of a deep
              suture, and develop a tectonic model for its formation.  Results should
              determine if the deformation was due to an intracontinential or an
              intercontinental tectonic setting.                         ;
