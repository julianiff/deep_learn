              Hudleston  Folds provide a key to understanding the nature of deformation in
              rocks.  They depend for their existence on the presence of layering or a planar
              fabric, and their form depends on rheological properties, initial layer
              configuration, and on the history and intensity of deformation.  Planar
              anisotropy is an important property of rocks, and it arises from preferred
              alignment of grains or crystallographic fabric, or from the alternation of
              isotropic layers of unlike viscosity.  This project focuses on the role of
              anisotropy in the development of folds, in particular their shape and
              associated strain pattern, with various starting configurations and kinematic
              conditions of  the deformation in which folds form in rocks.  The ultimate
              objective is to use the information gained using numerical models to determine
              the range of possible rheological properties and kinematic conditions under
              which natural folds form in rocks, and thus to better understand crustal
              deformation.                         ;                                  Oh
