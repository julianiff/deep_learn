Abstract    :
              9526735  Storm  NSF funds will provide partial support for seven student
              attendees  of the 1995 Gordon Conference on Optical Information Processing and 
              Holography.  The Conference in 1995 will stress optical memory,  displays for
              virtual reality, and high-speed optical data  acquisition.  This is an unusual
              conference in that there is time  for in-depth, informal, off-the-record,
              discussions and provides an  opportunity for the younger researchers to get to
              know the others.   The participants are leaders in the field, younger
              scientists, and  students who are doing research on the cutting edge topics of
              the  field.  ***
