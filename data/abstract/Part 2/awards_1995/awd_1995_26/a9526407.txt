Abstract    :
              Abstract:      The proposed planning grant is designed to develop a major
              research proposal to characterize three of the world's largest copper deposits,
              located in central Chile.  The deposits are higher grade, an order of magnitude
              larger, and distinct in alteration style relative to the well- studied copper
              deposits of western North America.  Varied erosional levels in the three
              deposits provide different and complementary information about zonation and ore
              deposition processes.  The planning grant will fund visits to each deposit in
              order to coordinate access and logistics, examine and collect drill core, and
              make preliminary assesments of the suitability of samples for chronologic and
              petrologic analyses.  The resulting project will involve much more
              comprehensive field and laboratory studies, including petrology, geochronology,
              and fluid inclusion studies, to deduce the anatomy and origin of the deposits.
