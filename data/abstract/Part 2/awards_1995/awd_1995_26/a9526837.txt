Abstract    :
              The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) project is located at the Cambridge
              Crystallographic Data Centre in the United Kingdom.  This award from the
              Division of Chemistry, Office of Special Projects, will provide 25 percent of
              the support for access to this database by U.S. scientists from the academic,
              government, and not-for-profit research communities.  This contribution will be
              transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the NSF becomes a
              co-supporter of the CSD.  The U.S. has over 1600 crystallographers who are
              potential users of this database.    The CSD contains the most comprehensive
              collection of evaluated crystallographic data in the world.  Data for about
              140,000 organic and organometallic crystal structures were included in the CSD
              as of January, 1995.  Atomic coordinates, chemical connectivity tables,
              bibliographic data fields including reference sources fop the data, and
              coordinates for chemical structure diagrams for each molecule are part of the
              system.  Software for search, retrieval, and analysis of the data will be
              supplied as well as any improvements and updates of the software.  About 12,000
              new crystal structures are added to the database each year.  Thus this
              international resource will remain accessible to crystallographic community and
              other users in the U.S. through the joint support of NSF and NIH.
