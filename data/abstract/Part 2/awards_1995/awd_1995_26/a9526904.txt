Abstract    :
              9526904  Nielson      This project is the continuation of technical and
              logistical  support of the U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program.  
              DOSECC (Drilling, Observation and Sampling of the Earth's  Continental Crust,
              Inc.) seeks funding for the Office of the  Drilling Engineer at Texas A & M
              University and the Office of the  Executive Director at the University of Utah.
                 The efforts proposed here are essential for a coordinated U.S.  Continental
              Scientific Drilling Program.  DOSECC represents the  scientific drilling
              interests of 43 universities, 3 national  laboratories and 1 state survey. 
              DOSECC is well-placed to support  the International Continental Scientific
              Drilling Program (ICDP)  and to maintain a close working relationship with the
              Ocean  Drilling Program (ODP).  In spite of budget limitations and the 
              perceived competition with other important science programs,  continental
              scientific drilling is alive and well and active as a  tool to assist modern
              earth scientists in determining the true  three dimensional structure of the
              upper part of the earth's crust  and the processes at work in it.  ***
