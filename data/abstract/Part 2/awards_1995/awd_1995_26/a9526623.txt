Abstract    :
              9526623  Sverjensky  This project is to develop a new multi-site model for the
              adsorption of protons and cations onto oxide and silicate surfaces that does
              not depend on empirical prediction of surface equilibrium constants from
              aqueous complexation constants.  After the new multi-site model has been
              calibrated, surface equilibrium constants should be predictable from the
              properties of the underlying crystal structure.  The model will be calibrated
              using published experimental data for surface titration, adsorption from
              solution, and surface spectroscopy.  The model will enable the prediction of
              adsorption behavior for many different mineral and solution compositions, which
              should facilitate the application of the model to both oxides and silicates in
              nature.
