              Twiss  This is a collaborative project to continue investigation of the
              application of micropolar continuum theory to the analysis of brittle
              deformation.  This research consists of theoretical and applied elements, both
              of which have significant implications for the study of active tectonics. 
              Seismic events and slickenlines on fault surfaces are manifestations of slip on
              shear planes that occurs in the brittle part of the Earth s crust.  The slip
              accommodates a specific geometry of deformation of defined by the orientation
              of the fault and the direction of slip.  The set of all such shearing events in
              a given volume accommodates the brittle deformation of  that volume.  If we
              assume that this brittle deformation is an accurate reflection of the tectonic
              deformation imposed, that we can invert the seismic focal mechanism data or the
              shear plane/slickenline data to determine the geometry of  the tectonic
              deformation.  The inversion of such data requires a deformation model that one
              fits to the observations.  The micropolar model of deformation is a continuum
              model that includes the effects o f the rotation of rigid fault blocks on the
              slip directions in any given shear plane, which other deformation models do not
              include.  Thus, using this model permits the extraction of more kinematic
              detail from the data than other inversion techniques provide.
