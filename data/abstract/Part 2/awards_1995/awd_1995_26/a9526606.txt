Abstract    :
              9526606  Toomey       This research involves the development of a practical
              tomographic  method to invert teleseismic delay times simultaneously for 
              heterogeneity and seismic anisotropy, assuming that the anisotropy  is
              approximated by hexagonal symmetry, and to apply the method to  existing data
              from southern California.  Forward modeling  calculations show that the delay
              time patterns associated with  anisotropy alone are comparable in magnitude to
              delays resulting  from typical upper mantle heterogeneity, underscoring the 
              importance of including anisotropy as a free parameter in  tomographic imaging.
               Inverse modeling of synthetic data are then  used to demonstrate that a
              tomographic approach is feasible and  stable.  This work shows that a
              tomographic analysis of P wave data  may be used to constrain variations in
              anisotropy with depth.  This  research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.  ***
