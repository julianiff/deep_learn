Abstract    :
                    9526412  Dry  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made to support
               research in the location of cracks in structures, particularly  leaks in
              pipes.  The method to be studied is to pass light  through liquid filled hollow
              optical fibers.  The size and type  of image that comes out the end of the
              broken fiber can be  correlated with the location of the crack.  This project
              is to  evaluate the sensitivity of the method.  ***
