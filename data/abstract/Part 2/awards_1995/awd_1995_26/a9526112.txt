Abstract    :
              9526112  Mitin  Solid state millimeter and submillimeter wave systems find wide
              application in communications, radar, diagnostics, and other fields. 
              Millimeter wave system (frequency range: 30-300 Ghz) are relatively well
              developed.  Submillimeter wave (300-3,000 Ghz) systems are still far from
              practical realization, due to a lack of suitable submillimeter radiation
              sources (SRS). For the theoretical design of SRS, we will employ submicron
              diodes in a nonconventional regime, i.e., charge accumulation due to transient
              overshoot rather than stationary negative differential conductivity. 
              Preliminary results demonstrate that nonconventional regime devices can operate
              at frequencies as high as 500-800 Ghz.  To attack this problem, we have
              developed a complex of programs for the numerical simulation of microwave power
              generation in two-terminal devices which account for the external resonant
              circuit.  One package of programs is based on a full kinetic description of
              device operation in an external circuit using the Monte Carlo particle (MCP)
              technique.  A second package is based on a modified hydrodynamic method (MHM)
              we have developed for the analysis of dc and ac hot-carrier transport in
              semiconductor materials and devices.  Using MHM and MCP methods, we will
              extensively investigate the possibility of obtaining microwave diode generators
              in the terahertz regime.  ***
