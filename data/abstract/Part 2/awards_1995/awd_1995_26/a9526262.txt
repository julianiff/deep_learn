Abstract    :
              9526262   Morse  The proposed research will clarify the melting behavior and
              early crystallization history of the Kiglapait layered intrusion with specific
              interest in the existence of troctolitic liquids, the thermal evolution of the
              Kiglapait magma, the depth and nature of the magma source, the liquid line of
              decent, plagioclase/liquid fractionation, and olivine/liquid fractionation. 
              Chilled marginal rocks from the intrusion will be melted and crystallized in
              graphite and Au-Pd capsules at pressure to find the liquid compositions in
              equilibrium with the saturating phases and to determine the mineral/liquid
              element partitioning.  Upper Border Zone rocks will also be studied to evaluate
              the liquid line of descent toward augite saturation.  Compositional mapping of
              experimental charges will be done using electron and proton microprobes.  The
              result will also be relevant to more general aspects of quantitative igneous
              petrology and the origin of Proterozoic anorthositic rocks.
