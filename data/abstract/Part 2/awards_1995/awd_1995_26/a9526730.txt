Abstract    :
              9526730  Ni         This grant provides $35,000 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring hardware, software and  peripherals to upgrade a computer
              laboratory used  for research in computational and observational  seismology. 
              Specific research includes studies of  active tectonics in southern Tibet and, 
              eventually, the monitoring of the Comprehensive  Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which
              prohibits all  nuclear weapons testing.  The bulk of this  equipment request
              includes a new Sun SPARCstation  20 server, 2 Sun SPARCstation 5's, increased 
              storage capacity and programming and data analysis  software.  The upgrade will
              benefit a small but  growing number of faculty and students in the  Geophysics
              department at New Mexico State  University.  ***
