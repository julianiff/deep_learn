Abstract    :
              9526763  Hemley  The goal of this project is to study the fundamental chemical
              properties of minerals at pressures and temperatures of the Earth's deep
              interior in order to obtain direct experimental constraints on the chemical
              composition, formation, and evolution of the mantle and core.  Deep mantle
              phases will be examined under high pressure and temperature conditions using a
              variety of new x-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.  In particular,
              high-pressure transitions in SiO2, AlO3, (Mg, Fe)SiO3 perovskite, the unusual
              high-pressure behavior of Fe-bearing oxides, and the stability of garnet in the
              lower mantle will be examined.  High pressure and temperature experiments on
              whole rock samples of appropriate mantle chemistries (e.g., peridotite,
              chondrite, basalt) will be performed at deep earth conditions and synchrotron
              x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy will be used
              for phase identification.  Also, deep mantle mineral inclusions in diamond will
              be examined with the new micro-analytical techniques.  phase relations of iron
              and iron alloys at core conditions will be performed using new in situ high
              pressure and temperature x-ray diffraction techniques.  Core-mantle boundary
              reactions will be explored both in situ and in quenched samples.
