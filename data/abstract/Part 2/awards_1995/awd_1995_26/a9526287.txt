Abstract    :
              The PIs will perform a comprehensive study of the interaction of  the jovian
              magnetosphere with cometary dust from Shoemaker-Levy 9.   They plan to explore
              the spatial evolution of dust particles from  (1) the breakup of the comet, (2)
              the suspected low level cometary  activity during the two year trip of the
              nuclei from breakup until  reentry, and (3) the motion of charged dust clouds
              inside the  magnetosphere.  Collaborating with a number of other observers, the
               PIs will analyze the dust detector observation from Ulysses and  Galileo.  In
              addition, their models will be used to explain the  observed distortion of the
              dust trails as some of the nuclei  reentered the magnetosphere.  The ultimate
              goal of this project is  to provide a detailed inventory of the spatial and
              temporal  evolution of cometary dust in Jupiter's magnetosphere.***
