Abstract    :
                    9526591  Rushmer  The proposed Research Planning Grant will experimentally
              investigate the micropermeability that develops during melting as a function of
              the melting rate and the processes by which melt migrates from localized
              melting sites at the onset of reaction.  Externally-heated, cold seal
              experiments under fluid-absent conditions will be run initially at 800C and
              850C and 3 to 5 kbar.  The results from these experiments will enhance our
              fundamental understanding of the rates and mechanisms controlling melt
              generation and segregation at the source, will provide new information which
              will help in the interpretation of natural geochemical data, and will enhance
              our understanding of the potential geochemical trace element abundances
              produced during melt segregation and the process of melt segregation itself.
