Abstract    :
              Moment resisting R/C frames if properly designed and  detailed they are very
              ductile systems capable of enduring  the most severe earthquake input motions.
              There has been a  substantial number of investigations of R/C beam to column 
              connections, but at least one common connection problem has  not been
              adequately researched, namely, connections in frame  systems composed of wide
              shallow beams and `normal` columns.  Over the last decade they have also been
              used to a limited  extent in regions of moderate to high seismic risk. Due to 
              the lack of experimental studies for these frame systems,  conflicting design
              recommendations have been developed.  Because wide beam connections are not
              uncommon in concrete  frame construction, and because there is a lack of 
              information on the behavior and resulting seismic response  of concrete frames
              that contain such connections, there is a  clear need for a well planned
              analytical and experimental  investigation of reinforced concrete frames that
              contain  such connections. The goal of this research project is to  combine
              prior experimental results with a limited number of  new test results to
              generate analytical models for  simulating the seismic response of wide beam
              frame  structures. Then, combine the analytical and experimental  studies to
              develop detailing requirements as well as  recommendations for the proper use
              of wide beam frames,  i.e., in what seismic zones, for what number of stories
              and  in combination with what other lateral load resisting  systems. This study
              will draw conclusive understanding to  the seismic behavior of reinforce
              concrete frame with wide  beam connections through laboratory experiments and
              finite  element analysis and the results could form the basis for  updating
              seismic design provisions for such connections.
