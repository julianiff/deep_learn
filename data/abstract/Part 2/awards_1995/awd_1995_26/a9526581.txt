Abstract    :
                 9526581 Pinizzotto   This research aims, using polynucleotides combined with
              II-VI inorganic materials, to explore a new and innovative approach to the
              synthesis and fabrication of optoelectronic nanometer structures.  Recognizing
              the many advantages of precise replication and ordering available from
              polynucleotides, divalent metal ions are to be loosely bound to specific sites
              of single stranded polynucleotides to provide an initial ordering/spacing;
              after preparation of a substrate for suitable adsorption this
              metal/polynucleotide complex is deposited on a substrate, and treated with a
              gaseous chalcogenide precursor to form nanoparticles at the
              metal/polynucleotide sites.  A combination of chemical and stereo-specific
              factors are expected to combine to yield an array of nanoparticles of narrow
              size distribution.  It may be feasible, for example, to form uniform assemblies
              of II-VI materials such as CdS along the polynucleotide chains, and therefore
              to be able to use polynucleotide structures to dictate the structure, position,
              and size, of semiconductor particles as well as the configurations of particle
              arrays. %%%  This project will explore a new and innovative approach to the
              synthesis of optoelectronic nanometer structures from the broad perspectives of
              chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology.  The idea being explored is
              the potential use of polynucleotide chains as templates for the fabrication of
              quantum dot structures of inorganic materials such as cadmium sulfide. This
              project sets specific goals and methods for an initial study to test these
              ideas.  The proposed research has potential for high pay-off to a broad range
              of new possibilities in optoelectronic materials, and several key issues can be
              appropriately addressed and resolved by the project. ***
