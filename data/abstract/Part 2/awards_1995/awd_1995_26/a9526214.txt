Abstract    :
              9526214  Mehrl  We propose prototype development of versatile two-dimensional
              VLSI  heterodyne detection arrays.  Such devices would find wide  application
              in many optical architectures that employ  temporal/spatiotemporal modulation
              techniques, such as acousto-  optic signal processing, two-dimensional real
              time image  processing, and swept-carrier time domain memories.    Upon
              successful completion of prototypes, a simple, yet powerful  and flexible
              two-dimensional image processing technique will be  demonstrated.  This
              technique, using spatiotemporal modulation of  the image, coupled with
              heterodyne detection, is particularly well  suited for two-dimensional image
              edge-detection and edge-  enhancement operations, and offers continuously
              variable spatial  resolution.  ***
