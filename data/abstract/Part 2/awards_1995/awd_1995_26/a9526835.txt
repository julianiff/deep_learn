Abstract    :
              9526835  McIntyre       This award will support a small workshop of
              investigators  studying the role of tropical heat transport on millennial time 
              scales.  The goal is to compare various geologic data sets, in  order to
              determine which ones are best at quantifying water  temperature and flow rate.
