Abstract    :
              9526980  Walter   This award provides partial funding (37% of total cost) for
              the acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
              system to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at
              the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan is committed to provide
              funding for the remaining cost of acquiring and installing the equipment.   The
              ICP-MS system will fill a need at the University of Michigan for elemental
              analysis in fluid and mineral phases at trace levels. Many of the research and
              teaching programs in the geological sciences at Michigan require complete
              analyses of very small samples or of elements present in very low
              concentrations of parts per billion or less. Samples include natural waters,
              solids such as minerals, biological tissues, sediments and soils. The spectrum
              of research projects needing such analytical capabilities is large and varied,
              including research in environmental geochemistry of regional groundwater
              systems, trace element contents of carbonates, paleoceanography, and mid-ocean
              ridge geochemistry. The analytical facility will be open to all researcher at
              the University, and will be used extensively by workers in the departments of
              chemistry and biology, the College of Pharmacy, School of Natural Resources,
              School of Public Health, and the Center for Great Lakes Research, among others.
