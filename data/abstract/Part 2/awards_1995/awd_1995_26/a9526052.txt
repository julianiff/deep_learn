Abstract    :
              CTS-9526052   Lakshmi Sridhar   University of Puerto Rico    ABSTRACT     The
              research will focus on developing a rate-based model for non-equilibrium
              separations that will handle multiple liquid phases.  The primary motivation
              stems form the advantages of employing non-equilibrium models for nonideal
              distillation, and the need for incorporating stability checks for heterogeneous
              mixtures.  Stability will be determined using tangent plane criterion. 
              Rate-based separation calculations will employ rigorously obtained mass
              transfer coefficients.  The new model will not assume equilibrium between
              phases and therefore represents real situations better than the ideal
              equilibrium-stage model.  The results may enable commercial process simulators
              to solve separation problems involving heterogeneous mixtures like ethanol,
              benzene and water.  In particular, there is potential for significant impact on
              the design and optimization of distillation columns.
