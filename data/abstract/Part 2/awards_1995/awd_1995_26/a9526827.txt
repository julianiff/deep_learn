Abstract    :
              Banerjee  9526827     Three loess regions in central Europe, central North
              America, and Alaska have been selected for a multi-proxy investigation with a
              strong magnetic component in a study for rapid and sensitive measurements of
              late Pleistocene climate change.  Such a comparative, within-region and
              between-regions investigation is necessary for continental areas.  We can then
              compare such data with the more numerous oceanic and ice-core records to test
              the validity of both the gradual and abrupt climate change history suggested
              for the last 130,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere.   Preliminary magnetic
              studies of the periglacial loess profiles suggest that signatures of wind
              strength, source aridity, and in situ oxidation or reduction can be separated
              through the use of multiple magnetic proxies.  Such proxies will then be
              validated by coulometric carbon, elemental analysis, grain-size measurements,
              and Mossbauer spectra.
