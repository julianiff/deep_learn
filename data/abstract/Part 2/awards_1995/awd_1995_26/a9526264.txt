Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this study is to investigate a number of  theoretical issues
              in language acquisition through an  experimental study on two particular
              instances of the placement  of specific objects, namely scrambling and clitic
              placement, in  Dutch child language (since Dutch displays both phenomena). 
              Although both scrambling and clitic placement have been discussed  extensively
              in the linguistic literature on adult grammar, they  have been studied only
              marginally in child language so far.  Consequently, we know very little about
              this aspect of child  grammar.         The data will be collected in Utrecht,
              The Netherlands.  Seventy Dutch children, ages 2;0 - 6;0 will be tested on
              their  interpretation of scrambling and clitic placement with an  elicitation
              and/or an imitation task.         The results of this study will contribute to
              the virtually  non-existing body of cross-linguistic research into the 
              development of clitic placement and scrambling. In addition, it  will
              illuminate the linguistic analysis of the placement of  specific objects, such
              as specific DPs (scrambling) and clitics  (clitic placement) in adult Dutch.
              Furthermore, the study will  bear on theories regarding the development of
              child language,  such as the 'Maturation Hypothesis' (Borer and Wexler, 1987),
              the  'Continuity Hypothesis' (Pinker, 1984; Clahsen, 1992) and the  'Principles
              and Parameters Theory'.
