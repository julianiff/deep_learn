Abstract    :
              9526596   Essene  This project involves petrological, geochemical, and isotopic
              studies of granulitic rock from different tectonic settings within the
              Sesia-Lanzo Zone (Western Alps) that record various degrees od transformations.
               Specific tasks include:  (1) thermobarometric studies on eclogites,
              blueschists and greenschists to constrain the depths to which the rocks have
              been buried; (2) evaluation of the role of fluids in triggering the
              transformations between the facies; (3) reevaluation of thermodynamic data for
              typical eclogite/blueschist minerals and derivation of a new internally
              consistent petrogenic grid for blueschists and eclogites; (4) radiogenic
              isotopic studies (Sm-Nd and U-Pb) to establish the timing of the events and the
              influence of metamorphic transitions on the behavior of these systems.  The
              results of this study will be important to evaluate discrepancies in the age of
              high pressure metamorphism in the Western Alps and will lead to a better
              understanding of deep crustal processes occurring during mountain building
              events in convergent tectonic zones.
