Abstract    :
              9526126  Zreda  Sequences of mafic lavas contain records of the cosmic ray
              intensity on earth.  Such lavas, however, are difficult to accurately date,
              especially beyond the 14C range, because of their fine-crystalline texture an
              low potassium content.  The in situ accumulation of cosmogenic nuclides can be
              potentially used to approach this problem.  I propose to test a new cosmogenic
              approach to determine the age of now-buried mafic lava flows and/or the
              cosmic-ray intensity in the past.  It uses two cosmogenic nuclides with
              different half-lives.  The accumulation up of a longer-lived or stable nuclide
              is used to determine how long the lava had been exposed at the surface.  the
              decay of a shorter-lived nuclide gives the burial duration.  The feasibility of
              this novel approach will be tested using selected samples from the 1056-m core
              at Hilo, Hawaii.  This preliminary study has three objectives:  (1) to evaluate
              the retention of cosmogenic noble gases; (2) to evaluate the utility of
              long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides as a measure of the exposure duration; and
              (3) to assess the utility of shorter-lived cosmogenic nuclides as a measure of
              the burial duration.  If the approach is successful, it will enable us to
              simultaneously determine cosmogenic ages of lava flows and the cosmic ray
              intensity during their exposure to the atmosphere.  Preliminary results in this
              project will be used in future proposals to perform a comprehensive cosmogenic
              study on this and other volcanic sequences.
