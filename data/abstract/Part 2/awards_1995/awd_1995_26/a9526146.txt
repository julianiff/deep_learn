Abstract    :
              9526146  Overbye         The ability to transfer power on a transmission system
              is  dependent upon a number of factors, with arguably the most  constraining
              being the requirement to maintain system integrity  following the occurrence of
              any of a plausible set of  contingencies.  That is, if a particular contingency
              should  occur, there must be a viable plan to return the system to a  secure
              operating point.  Having such a plan permits basecase  operation at higher
              levels of power transfer since should the  contingency occur, one knows how to
              restore the system to a  secure operating point; not having these plans
              requires more  constrained operation.       For an unsolvable contingent case,
              if effective control  action is not taken quickly enough following the
              contingency that  pushed the system into the unsolvable state, the system will 
              experience a dynamic voltage collapse.  Research in this area  will investigate
              the dynamic consequences of unsolvability, with  the aim of developing
              computationally tractable methods for  determining an optimal set of controls
              to restore such a case to  secure operation.  ***
