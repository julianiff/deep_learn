Abstract    :
              9526796  Rial      This research is to investigate the cause of the anomalously
              high ground shaking in Tarzana caused by the January 17, 1994, Northridge,
              California, earthquake.  This work will test the hypothesis that the anomalous
              motion is in part caused by the effects of an old landslide on which Tarzana is
              proposed to be situated.  Detailed modeling of accelerograms using realistic
              velocity structures will be performed with software developed by the Principal
              Investigator.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***  ??
