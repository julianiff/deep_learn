Abstract    :
              The collision of comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter has caused  a dramatic
              increase in Jupiter's microwave emission, which provides  an excellent
              opportunity to study the physical processes to which  the energetic electrons
              in the planet's inner magnetosphere are  subjected.  The PIs will (1) reduce
              and analyze the data obtained  before, during and after the week of cometary
              impacts, and (2)  continue their monitor program of the planet's radio
              emission.   They will investigate the radial diffusion of the energetic 
              electrons, determine the diffusion coefficient and relate this to  the
              turbulence in Jupiter's upper atmosphere via the diffusion  mechanism.  In
              addition, they will determine the enhancement in the  amount of dust in
              Jupiter's magnetosphere due to the passage of  comet SL9.  Finally, the PI will
              collaborate to explain the  increase in the radio emissions.***
