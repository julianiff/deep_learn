              Abstract  ATM-952664  Prentice, Michael L.  University of New Hampshire  Title:
              High-Resolution Coastal Record of Western Equatorial Pacific          and
              Adjacent Highland Climate During the Last Glacial Cycle    The goal of this
              study is to derive a high-resolution coupled  record of surface and
              high-altitude climate change in the western  Pacific warm-pool (WPWP) over the
              last glacial cycle.  The  record will come from Cenderawasih Bay on the
              northwest  coast of New Guinea.  Because of its position, proxy  records in
              Cenderawasih Bay concurrently monitor the temperature  and hydrology of the
              core WPWP as well as changes in temperature  and precipitation on the directly
              adjacent Irian Jaya highland.   The program involves a seismic survey and
              piston cores will be  collected.  WPWP temperature and precipitation changes
              will be  distinguished using foraminiferal isotope records supplemented by  SST
              estimates derived from transfer-function analysis of planktonic  foraminiferal
              census data.  High-altitude paleoclimate changes  caused significant
              fluctuations in the extent of high-altitude  glaciation as well as the
              composition and elevation of vegetation  zones.  Glacier, vegetation, and
              climate changes also will be  reconstructed.  By filling a large spatial and
              temporal gap in  tropical paleoclimate reconstructions, this project  will
              contribute to understanding the role of the global tropical  climate system in
              large-magnitude global changes on sub-millennial  timescales.***
