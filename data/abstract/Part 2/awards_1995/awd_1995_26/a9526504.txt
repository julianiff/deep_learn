Abstract    :
              This award is jointly made in the Office of Special Projects of the   Chemistry
              Division and the Eastern Europe  Program in the Division of   International
              Programs. The award will  provide participant costs for   eight U.S. graduate
              students at the `Advanced Research Workshop on the   Preparation of
              Nanoparticles in Solution and in Solids` to be held in   Szeged, Hungary, March
              8-13, 1996. Participation will be by competitive   application and each
              successful applicant will present a poster talk on   his or her research in
              nanostructures or nanoparticles. Proceedings of   the Workshop will be
              published.  Nanostructures and  nanoparticles find application in a variety of 
               advanced materials, including electronic, optical, magnetic and   biomolecular
              materials. This Workshop will bring together and integrate   existing
              solid-state, physical and wet colloid-chemical methodologies, as   well as lay
              the foundation for future synergistic endeavors among   chemists, physicists
              and biologists.
