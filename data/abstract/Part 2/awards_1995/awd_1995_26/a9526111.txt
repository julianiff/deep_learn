Abstract    :
              The vast majority of primates, including humans, possesses anatomical and
              behavioral adaptations for either a nocturnal (night-active) or diurnal
              (day-active) lifestyle. A group of prosimian primates in Madagascar, however,
              displays a distinctly different activity cycle where there is a potential for
              activity at any time of the day or night. Although such 24-hour activity is
              common among other mammalian species, it is extremely unusual in primates.
              Therefore, in this proposed dissertation study, fifteen months of data will be
              collected to examine the 24-hour activity in two lemur species, the mongoose
              lemur (Eulemur mongoz) and the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus). The
              research will be conducted in the tropical dry forest of Ankarafantsika Nature
              Reserve in northwest Madagascar. Specifically, this study will attempt to
              determine whether 24-hour activity in these primates is driven by such features
              of their natural environment as food availability, predator pressure, and
              climate. In addition, this study will examine whether any differences exist
              between the lemurs' daytime and nighttime behavior. The results of this
              research will be used to generate a model explaining why a 24-hour activity
              cycle is adaptive for these primates, and to also reach a better understanding
              of the importance of activity cycle in the evolutionary history of human and
              non-human primates.
