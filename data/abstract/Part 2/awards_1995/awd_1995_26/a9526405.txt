Abstract    :
              9526405  Rhodes  About 2000 years ago there was a profound perturbation in
              Kilauea's magmatic plumbing system.  The effects lasted almost to the present  
              Previous work has shown that, over most of this period, the lavas erupted at or
              near Kilauea's summit area have ranged in major, trace and isotopic
              compositions from lavas with the compositional characteristics of historical
              Kilauea magmas, through intermediate compositions, to lavas that closely
              resemble Mauna Loa magmas.  There are two plausible explanations:  either there
              were short-term changes in the proportions of source components in the Hawaiian
              plume that supply Kilauea, or magma from Mauna Loa invaded Kilauea' magmatic
              plumbing system, possibly in response to catastrophic caldera formation and
              eruption of the Uwekahuna Ash.  This project is to complete this work and to
              test these two contrasting hypotheses.  To test these observations,  I will
              systematically sample sequential flows exposed continuously in the 100 m walls
              of Makaopuhi pit crater.  This crater is 13 km down Kilauea's east rift zone
              from the summit caldera.   Within the thick sequence of exposed flows are about
              0.5-0.75 ka.  Makaopuhi  Crater is, therefore, an ideal location to test
              whether there are flows with anomalous Mauna Loa characteristics (1) that are
              older than the Uwekahuna Ash, and (2) that are far-removed from the summit
              caldera.  Comprehensive major and trace element data will be obtained on these
              samples by XRF and INAA to determine their compositional affinities.  In
              addition, Dr. J. P. Lockwood (USGS) and I will attempt to recover charcoal from
              beneath these flows and the ash layer to provide temporal control by 14C
              dating.  With these questions resolved, we will be in a much better position to
              evaluate whether or not the Mauna Loa-like flows are a consequence of magmatic
              invasion from Mauna Loa, or whether there was a major perturbation in the
              proportions of source components supplying Kilauea from the Hawaiian plume
              during this period.
