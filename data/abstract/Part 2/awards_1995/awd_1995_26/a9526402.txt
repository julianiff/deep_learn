Abstract    :
              9526402  Hegg     Atmospheric aerosol particles are believed to influence the
              earth's radiation balance either directly by scattering and absorbing incoming
              solar radiation, or indirectly by altering cloud microphysical properties. 
              This project addresses the effects of heterogeneous sulfate chemistry on cloud
              droplet number concentrations and size distributions (the aerosol indirect
              effect).   The study uses computer modeling to  develop a parameterization of
              the impact of cloud heterogeneous chemistry on the optical and water active
              properties of cloud-processed sulfate aerosols.  The parameterization utilizes
              a transfer function to allow estimation of the impact from an array of
              prognostic variables that are components of standard, bulk-paramerized cloud
              models. The regional scale modeling approach is a new method for evaluating the
              influence of cloud heterogeneous chemistry on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
              and optical properties, a refinement not currently possible with existing
              global climate models (GCMs).  The results from the project will provide needed
              improvements in the current ability of models in generating realistic
              treatments of cloud/aerosol interactions on a regional scale.  This
              parameterization study will be a key, fundamental step in developing similar
              parameterizations for GCM's.
