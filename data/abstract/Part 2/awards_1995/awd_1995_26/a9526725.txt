Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a study to sample surface snow in  pits and to
              drill shallow cores in the vicinity of South Pole to  look for evidence of the
              June, 1991, eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in  the Philippines.  Extensive
              measurements and observations by  satellite, ground-based and airborne
              atmospheric instruments are  available regarding the amount of sulfur dioxide
              emitted from the  eruption, as well as the global distribution and decay of the
               stratospheric aerosols derived from the volcanic sulfur dioxide.  Ground-based
              and airborne measurements in Antarctica clearly  indicate that the
              stratospheric sulfate aerosols from this  eruption reached high southern
              latitudes in late 1991 and  persisted in the Antarctic atmosphere through 1993.
               Preliminary  results from snow pit samples recently taken in the South Pole 
              area indicate that the Pinatubo signal exists and can be  separated from the
              signal of another volcanic eruption (Cerro  Hudson) which occurred in
              mid-August, 1991.  Combined with the  known total sulfate aerosol production
              from Pinatubo, the  proposed sampling and analyses will yield the quantitative 
              information necessary to establish empirical relationships  between the
              explosivity of a low-latitude eruption and the  amplitude of its corresponding
              signals in Antarctic snow.
