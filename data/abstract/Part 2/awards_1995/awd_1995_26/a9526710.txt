Abstract    :
              9526710  Morgan      The PI proposes to develop an experimental capability to
              measure  electrokinetic streaming potential data of the cross-coupling 
              coefficient (volts per pressure difference) and the associated  approximation
              of the water/mineral surface potential at in situ P/T  conditions for whole
              rock samples.  Most of the values presently  available were obtained at ambient
              conditions or on crushed rock at  elevated temperatures.  These will be the
              first streaming potential  data to be collected on a suite of earth materials
              in contact with  varying chemical solutions at elevated P/T conditions of the 
              earth's crust.  These data are essential for understanding the role  of water
              in subsurface processes, and will have many engineering  and environmental
              applications related to ground water monitoring,  oil-well pumping patterns,
              electroseismic effects and possibly as  electromagnetic earthquake precursors,
              as well as scientific  applications in fracture mechanics, seismic attenuation,
              electrical  impedance modeling.  ***
