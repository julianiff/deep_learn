              Skies UNIDATA Equipment    Funds will purchase a UNIX-based server to provide
              Internet Data  Distribution (IDD) services.  The present server acts as the 
              primary server for the Blue Skies Project.  This project is  sponsored by
              NSF/EHR and focuses on delivering data and software  tools to the K-12
              educational community.It was anticipated that  Blue-Skies related load on the
              IDD server will triple and required  a dedicated server.
