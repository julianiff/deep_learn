Abstract    :
              9526114  Paulraj       Traditional barriers across disciplines such as 
              Communications, Computing, Control, and Signal Processing are  fast
              disappearing.  New technological challenges require concepts  and techniques
              from several disciplines.  Moreover,  interdisciplinary approaches are being
              increasingly developed to  tackle challenging problems in seemingly disparate
              areas.  Driven  by fundamentally new applications and approaches, the coming 
              century will need even further convergence and cross-  fertilization of ideas. 
                   The general objective of the conference is to highlight some  of the
              recent advances made toward developing and integrated  approach to problem
              solving at various levels, and to communicate  some of the exciting questions
              and challenges that remain  unsolved.  The conference will stimulate
              discussions at various  levels:  mathematical foundations; algorithms:
              statistical and  computational efficiency, numerical issues, new paradigms; 
              architectures (parallel systems, hardwired, reconfigurable and  programmable).
