Abstract    :
              Imagining an event and watching it unfold in the mind's eye is a common
              experience of most people.  It has often been proposed that this is one basis
              for thinking about events and predicting their outcomes, and that thereby it is
              an important method of reasoning, planning, communicating, and understanding. 
              This research attempts to place such imagistic reasoning on a firm theoretical
              footing by characterizing it as precisely defined computations performed on
              mental representations.  The research focuses on the use of diagrams as a
              vehicle for reasoning about spatial relations and mathematical concepts that
              can be understood by spatial analogies.  Spatial reasoning and diagram
              interpretation are important abilities of humans, and machines with similar
              abilities have advantages over machines without them, including a more natural
              mode of interaction with people.  The goal of this research is a better
              scientific understanding of human cognitive psychology, and the basis of a
              technology for machines that can think directly in images.  Potential
              applications of spatial reasoning programs and theory include automated
              navigation systems, improved computer-human interfaces, improved methods for
              clearly presenting scientific data and control panel information, methods of
              diagnosing faults in machines, and improved methods of technical instruction.
