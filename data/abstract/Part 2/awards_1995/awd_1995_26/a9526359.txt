Abstract    :
              9526359  Srivastava    A  novel approach to optical chemical sensing is proposed
              in  this SGER effort.  The glass-polymer structures in which dye  doped 
              polyimide  wave  guide is deposited  on  a  glass  is  proposed.  A sensing
              layer is deposited on this structure to  interact  with  the  environment to be
               sensed.   This  SGER  effort  will  explore the low cost fabrication of  low 
              cost  polyimide guides for chemical sensing.  Various dye and  the  doping 
              content in glass-polymers will be tested to  achieve  the  maximum sensitive
              compositons.  The idea is  novel  and  has not been explored fully.  %%%  The 
              glass-polymer structures in which dye  doped  polyimide  wave  guide is
              deposited on a glass are proposed as a  novel  approach to optical chemical
              sensing.
