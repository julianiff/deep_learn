Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a research program involving the  use of passive
              microwave data to validate key paleoclimate  indicators used in glaciologic
              research.  The specific  contributions of this research are: 1) to define the
              timing and  spatial extent of hoar complexes, which may serve as visible, 
              annual stratigraphic markers in ice cores, through a combination  of satellite
              passive microwave data and field observations; and  2) to monitor temperature
              trends at the site with calibrated  passive microwave brightness temperatures
              and to correlate these  trends to proxy temperatures provided by oxygen and
              hydrogen  stable isotope ratio profiles from snow pits and/or ice cores.  The
              work will take place at Siple Dome, Antarctica as part of the  field activities
              associated with the ice core drilling program  there.
