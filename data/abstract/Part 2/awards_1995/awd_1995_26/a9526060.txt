Abstract    :
               9526060 Dupuis  An International Symposium on Gallium Nitride and Related
              Materials is being held to address current topics in materials growth and
              characterization including several contemporary topics of increasing
              importance, namely;  Kinetics Of Chemical Reactions; Surface Chemistry Of
              Precursors; Synthesis Of Novel Precursors For Nitride Growth; Properties Of
              Wurtzite And Cubic Nitride Materials; Electronic And Structural Properties Of
              Interfaces And Thin Films; Defect Structure Of Interfaces And Materials; Growth
              Of Heteroepitaxial Films; And Substrates For Heteroepitaxial Growth.  There are
              also a number of sessions dealing with physics and device aspects with a strong
              emphasis on fundamental processes.  Additionally there will be an opportunity
              to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research
              institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field
              will attend, and that the Symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss
              and delineate the critical scientific issues in this emerging research area,
              and to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address
              them.  %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Gallium Nitride and
              related materials, and especially critical materials research issues in
              epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and
              circuit fabrication along with current assessments of the most important
              contemporary research issues in this field will be of great value to the
              understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of
              electronics and photonics.  These materials have particular advantages and
              characteristics for development of blue-green lasers and LEDs useful in a host
              of display and communications technologies.    ***
