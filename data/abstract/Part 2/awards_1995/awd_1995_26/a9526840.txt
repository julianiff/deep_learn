Abstract    :
              9526840  Carlson  This award is a component of an international,
              multi-institutional, interdisciplinary study of the Kaapvaal craton in southern
              Africa.  This four-year project will determine the geological processes that
              led to the formation and stabilization of this and other ancient continental
              cratons.  The Kaapvaal craton preserves Archean (2.6 to 3.6 Ga) continental
              crust and mantle.  The crustal rocks are well exposed and the mantle and deep
              crust have been sampled by abundant kimberlites that provide information about
              the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of deep lithospheric structure.
               The Principal Investigators will use a number of geophysical and geochemical
              techniques to investigate the structure of the craton.    The results of these
              diverse approaches will be integrated with research programs of several South
              African groups to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
              three-dimensional structure, chemical composition and tectonic evolution of the
              mantle and crust of the Kaapvaal craton.  The data will be used to evaluate
              competing models of craton assembly and to provide constraints on the
              continental dynamics of the early earth.  ***
