Abstract    :
              9526864  Glazner  The first phase of the Southern Sierra Continental Dynamics
              Project (SSCD) yielded the surprising result that a mountain range standing up
              to 2800 m higher than surrounding lowlands has a sialic crust of thickness
              nearly equal to that of the lowlands (30-40km), based on both passive and
              active seismic imaging.  Three-dimensional tectonic reconstruction of the
              adjacent Basin and Range province suggests Neogene thinning of both eastern
              Sierran and Basin and Range crust by a factor of two.  These results confirm an
              upper mantle origin for buoyancy beneath the range, and present perhaps the
              starkest illustration of a major unsolved problem in the dynamics of the
              cordilleran lithosphere: How can the profound loss of buoyancy from Neogene
              crustal thinning be reconciled with long-standing paleobotanical,
              geomorphological, and stratigraphic arguments indicating 1-2 km or more of
              Cordillera-wide late Cenozoic uplift?  Obvious end member solutions include: 
              (1)  little or no thinning of eastern sierran crust  (2)  an unusually large
              decrease in density in the upper mantle  (3)  regional subsidence of a high,
              Andean-type plateau, rather than uplift.    This award is one component of the
              second phase of the SSCD that has as it's goal the evaluation of the above
              hypotheses with a focused, multidisciplinary approach involving balanced
              cross-sections, seismic tomography, thermochronometry and isotope tracer
              studies, long-period MT, and low-temperature thermochronometry of Sierran
              granitoids.  ***
