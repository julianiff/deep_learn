Abstract    :
              9526593  Hoffman  The Institute for Computer and Telecommunications System
              Policy  (ICTSP), a research center at the George Washington University  serves
              as a unique, interdisciplinary policy institute for both the  University and
              the Washington region.  The ICTSP wants to focus on  new telecommunications
              issues that make their way onto the public  agenda.  A number of public policy
              issues have been identified  which ICTSP will be researching and facilitating
              discussions for.    This proposal requests stable funding to provide a base
              from which  to build ongoing work and so that technological building of the 
              network infrastructure can have a solid underpinning of well-  reasoned policy
              decisions and can support any reasonable set of  policy assumptions.  Funding
              provided by this grant will help put  in place mechanisms for supporting
              reports, videotapes and other  works produced by affiliated scholars.
