Abstract    :
                 9526100 Spence  This project addressees research into fundamental atomic
              processes responsible for dislocation motion in semiconductors, and into the
              mechanism of surfactant action in controlling layer-by-layer epitaxial crystal
              growth.  Two research aspects being emphasized are:  (1)direct observation of
              kinks in motion on dislocations by atomic resolution electron microscopy using
              "forbidden" reflection TEM lattice imaging in silicon at 600C; pinning
              mechanisms of kinks and the correlations of kinks on different partial
              dislocation, and factors which ultimately control the ductility of crystals at
              the atomic level are of basic interest.  (2) a recently developed Scanning Atom
              Probe (SAP) which allows groups of atoms from identified sites in an STM image
              to be ejected into a time-of-flight mass analyzer for chemical identification,
              will be used to study surfactant action during the growth of Ge on Si, and to
              test theories of surfactant action in the early stages of low-temperature
              epitaxial growth.   Theoretical analyses, e.g., ab-initio computations of kink
              mobility, are an integral part of the project. %%%  A Scanning Atom Probe (SAP)
              has recently been developed and will be used for basic research studies of
              surfactant mediation during epitaxial crystal growth of electronic and photonic
              materials.  Both  SAP and high resolution electron microscopy will be used to
              study the motion of atomic defects, and additional atomic level phenomena that
              ultimately control macroscopic material properties.  An important feature of
              the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. *** .
