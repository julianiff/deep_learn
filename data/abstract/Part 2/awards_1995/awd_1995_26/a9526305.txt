Abstract    :
              95-26305  Grossman  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Grossman and his
              co-principal investigator, Dr. John Wang, will complete the reduction and
              analysis of unique radio interferometer observational data sets, which were
              taken to determine the effects the event had on the Jovian troposphere and
              magnetosphere during and after the impact.  The data sets were obtained at the
              Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope.    In particular, the
              investigators expect to get information on atmospheric structure and the
              abundances of the trace constituents ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water; the
              presence or lack of discernible features associated with the impacts; and the
              penetration depths of the individual fragments.  Furthermore, this research is
              expected to improve our understanding of the response of the Jovian
              magnetosphere to dust loading and shocking, and the time-scales for transport
              of injected material and relaxation of the various physical perturbations.  **
