Abstract    :
              9526988  Getting      The PI proposes experiments to measure the complex
              torsional  modulus of olivine and periclase at high temperatures, small strain 
              amplitudes, and seismic frequencies by subjecting a cylindrical  sample to
              harmonic torsion.  The ability to measure strain wave  attenuation over large
              frequency and temperature ranges is  important for the direct interpretation of
              attenuation of seismic  waves in the earth for the interpretation of lateral
              seismic  velocity variations, and to illuminate the fundamental relations 
              between stress, microdefects and strain wave propagation.  The  systematic
              study of inelasticity in earth materials is a vital  complement to the study of
              the elastic properties of these  materials.  ***
