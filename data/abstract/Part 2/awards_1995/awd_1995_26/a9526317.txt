Abstract    :
              9526317  Kirkpatrick  This research will focus on the atomic/molecular scale
              structural environments and dynamic behavior of geochemically and
              environmentally important minerals.  The three major components of this
              research program are:  adsorbed inorganic cations, adsorbed and exchanged
              inorganic anions and interlayer exchanged inorganic anions and interlayer
              exchanged organic species.  The research will use magnetic resonance
              spectroscopy (NMR), spectroscopy to simultaneously probe structure and dynamics
              at a local atomic/molecular level and in the relatively slow frequency range of
              Hz to 100's MHz.  NMR will also be used to investigate mineral/water systems in
              situ.  Adsorption/exchange will be studied for a number of important cations
              (Na, Cd, Hg and Cs), anions (borate, nitrate and carbonate) and neutral organic
              species (phenol and pyridine) on a variety of important minerals (kaolinite,
              illite, boehmite, sodalite and hydrotalcite).  NMR methods have the potential
              to provide important new information about the molecular scale interaction in
              these orgono-clay complexes.  The results of this project will significantly
              improve our understanding of the surface adsorption and internal exchange of
              species between minerals and aqueous fluids and are important to the areas of
              nuclear and chemical hazardous waste management.
