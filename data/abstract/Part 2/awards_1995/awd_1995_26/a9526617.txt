Abstract    :
              9526617  Barker     This research is a collaborative effort with seismologists
              and earthquake engineers in Mexico City and Grenoble to extend existing methods
              for modeling 3-D seismic wave propagation in multi-layered structures.  The
              work is necessary in order to understand and explain the high levels of
              amplification and long durations of earthquake ground motion in Mexico City,
              the Tarzana, California nursery and other important sites.  Variations of the
              Boundary Element Method along with codes that extensive use of parallel
              processors will be developed.  This research is a aomponent of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
