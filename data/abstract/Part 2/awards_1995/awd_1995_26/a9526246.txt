Abstract    :
              Abstract/Street  ATM-9526246            A well defined set of numerical
              experiments is proposed for an  investigation of turbulent flow over complex
              terrain.  The objective is the  simulation and analysis of flow features
              crucial in the physics of dispersion  and mixing over topography and for the
              improvement of mesoscale  atmospheric simulation, (e.g., lee waves, wave
              breaking, flow separation,  and orographic drag).  An important first step
              towards improved  understanding of these features in the atmosphere is their
              accurate  simulation at model (laboratory) scales.          The proposed
              extension of a set of simulation tools developed  under a previous NSF grant
              contains the elements necessary for accurate  simulation of model-scale
              atmospheric flows.  The research strategy is to:   develop the numerical tools,
              validate and test the toolds, and investigate  turbulent flow over several
              arrangements of terrain.  Simulation of  laboratory-sized geophysical flows
              over complex terrain would contribute  to field-scale atmospheric  simulations
              in two ways:  through the  improvement of approximate boundary conditions and
              parameterizations  for mesoscale simulations, and through direct insight into
              the flow  physics.
