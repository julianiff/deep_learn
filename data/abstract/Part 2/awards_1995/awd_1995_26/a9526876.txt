Abstract    :
              9526876  Meinert  The Dal'negorsk skarn project presents an opportunity to apply
              American Academic expertise in the are of skarn deposits towards the study of
              an apparently unique geological setting containing both boron and lead-zinc
              skarn deposits.  This research will investigate the genesis of the Dal'negorsk
              deposit and demonstrate the relationship between borosilicate and lead-zinc
              skarn mineralization in the district.  Geological mapping, petrologic,
              mineralogic and fluid inclusion studies will test the working hypothesis that
              datolite and lead-zinc mineralization are genetically related to the same
              intrusive-hydrothermal events.  A 1994 filed visit allowed for the collection
              of a significant skarn sample suite, but two tasks remain that can only be
              accomplished by a second field visit.  The first is a minimum of two to three
              weeks of deposit and inter-deposit scale geological mapping.  The second task
              is to examine in greater detail the relationship between igneous rocks and the
              two skarn types.  Funding to cover transportation to the field site in the CIS.
