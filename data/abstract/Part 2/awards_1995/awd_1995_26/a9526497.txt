Abstract    :
              9526497  Stiglich    This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a planning
              visit  by Dr. Jacob J. Stiglich of Materials Modification, Inc.  (MMI),
              Fairfax, Virginia, to go to Mexico to meet with Dr.  Lorenzo Martinez at the
              National Autonomous University of  Mexico in Cuernavaca.  They will define an
              international  cooperative research project between the two organizations 
              involving advanced wear and corrosion resistant coating  technology.  There are
              three areas which are of interest to  both sides.  They are: 1. Wear and
              corrosion resistant  coatings by pulsed electrode deposition; 2. Solid
              lubricant  materials; and 3. Nanoparticles which can be adapted to 
              photovoltaic uses. MMI has begun prototype coating  activities with emphasis on
              wear resistance provided by WC  and Cr carbides based coatings.  The Mexican
              institute will  significantly extend these testing and characterization 
              activities.  Because petrochemicals and mining are essential  components of
              Mexico's economic base, the two groups will be  able to work on the wear and
              corrosion problems which Mexico  faces in that environment.  MMI can then take
              the data and  results of this research to U.S. counterpart industries.  ***
