Abstract    :
              9526184   Sillman     Recent measurements of tropospheric trace species were
              performed as part of the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE) at remote
              marine locations along the North Atlantic coast. These species include ozone;
              which impacts human health, agricultural crops and ecosyqtems; hydroxyl
              radical, which controls tropospheric lifetimes of a wide range of species,
              including methane and halogenated hydrocarbons; and nitrogen oxides. These
              measurements provide important information about the chemistry of polluted
              continental air masses exported to the Atlantic Ocean. Preliminary results
              suggest that significant removal of reactive nitrogen occurs as continental air
              travels over the ocean, possibly associated with fog events.    This project
              will investigate the export of chemically reactive species using a combined
              continental- and urban/regional-scale model developed by the PI. The
              urban/regional-scale model represents the photochemical evolution of urban
              plumes transported over water and includes the impact of vertically stratified
              circulation over water. The model chemistry will be enhanced to include aqueous
              reactions, and representation of fog events. This project could identify
              conditions that lead to the removal of nitric acid and PAN and quantify removal
              rates for these reactive nitrogen-containing species. Comparison of the model
              results with the NARE measurement data will be performed to assess and refine
              the model's ability to simulate chemical processing and transport of polluted
              continental air masses as they travel over the Atlantic Ocean.
