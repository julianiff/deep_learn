Abstract    :
              9526408  Tubbesing  This award renews support for the Earthquake Engineering
              Research  Institute's Learning From Earthquakes Project (LFE).  The primary 
              purpose of the LFE Project is to observe and document the effects  of
              earthquakes on the built environment and the resulting social,  economic and
              policy impacts.  Over the years the project has  led  to  considerable  new
              knowledge and changes in practice  and  has  stimulated important research in
              each of the disciplines involved  in  earthquake loss reduction.  This award
              will underwrite  field  research,  report  preparation and the dissemination 
              of  lessons  learned.  ***
