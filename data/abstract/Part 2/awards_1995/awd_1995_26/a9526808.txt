Abstract    :
                EEC-9526808  Dougherty    This award is to establish a
              cooperative/collaborative research program between The Pennsylvania State
              University Center for Dielectric Studies Industry/University  Cooperative
              Research Center and the University of California at Berkeley Sensor and
              Actuator Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in the area of lead
              zirconate titanate dielectrics for microelectromechanical devices.   The center
              at the University of California is working on surface micromachined devices and
              the design of microsystems and components.  The center at The Pennsylvania
              State University is working on the physics of thin-film dielectric,
              piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials.  In this program the institutions
              are sharing expertise and facilities with the goal of improving the performance
              of piezoelectrically-activated microdevices through the implementation of
              highly active piezoelectric films in microelectromechanical devices.
