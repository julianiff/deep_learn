Abstract    :
              9526166  Scott    This grant supports travel for invited speakers and student 
              presenters for the symposium on Micromechanics of Advanced  Materials, to be
              held at the TMS-AIME Meeting in Cleveland,  Ohio, October 5-9, 1995.  The
              objective of this symposium  is to bring together internationally distinguished
              material  scientists of different expertise to provide a forum for  discussion
              of important advances in micromechanics of high  technology materials.  The 
              program is attached, which  consists of 39 invited papers and 46 contributed
              papers.  The broad spectrum and high-caliber of invited speakers  covers the
              interrelation between the micro and  macromechanics of fracture in advanced
              materials, such as  intermetallics, composites, polymer-based composites, and 
              amorphous materials.  Fatigue and fracture and crack growth  modeling are
              considered.  %%%  This symposium accomplishes two things: It provides a 
              comprehensive understanding of the essential roles of  micromechanics of
              defects, specifically, dislocations,  cracks and etc., on mechanical behavior
              of advanced  materials, and it serves as a guideline for the future  materials
              research direction.  The symposium will bring  together a classic proceedings
              volume for the materials  research community to use.  ***
