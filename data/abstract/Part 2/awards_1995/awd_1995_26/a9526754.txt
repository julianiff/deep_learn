Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has awarded a grant to   Professor
              Herbert Strauss of the University of California at Berkeley to   continue his
              studies probing complex, disordered systems using infrared   (IR) hole-burning
              techniques. Using an IR laser, Strauss will irradiate a   probe molecule
              (ammonium ion, in this case), which makes up part of the   complex system,
              forcing it to rotate into a new position, and thereby   creating a dip in the
              IR absorption.  These holes are refilled by   tunneling of the probe molecule
              at low temperature, and the relaxation   dynamics is monitored by IR
              absorption.  In related experiment, Raman and   neutron spectra of hydrogen
              (probe molecules) in water, ice and zeolites   will be undertaken to yield
              comparable information.    Hydrogen embedded in ice or zeolite is of importance
              in many fields of   science and technology such as astronomy, energy storage,
              and catalysis.    Hydrogen is of special importance because its properties are
              amenable to   calculation.  Consequently, calculations of the hydrogen
              time-dependent   properties, which lead to the spectra, are likely to be
              incisive.
