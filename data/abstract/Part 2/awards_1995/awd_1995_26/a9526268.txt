Abstract    :
              David M. Hanson of the State University of New York-Stony Brook is   supported
              by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to selectively   excite, using
              x-ray radiation from the National Synchrotron Light Source   (NSLS), core
              electrons in gas phase molecules, and then study the   core-hole decay.  He
              will determine how this selectivity is preserved   during decay, identify the
              excited states involved, and look at the   molecular structure dependence of
              the decay processes.  In addition, the   mechanisms and dynamics of
              fragmentation after core electron excitation   will be investigated, as will
              the final state energy distribution and its   relationship to the potential
              energy surface.    The processes to be studied play a key role in the chemistry
              occurring in   space, in planetary atmospheres, and in atomic reactors.  For
              example,   x-ray absorption spectra are used in astronomy to provide
              information   about the universe.  Core-electron excitation and ionization and 
               core-hole decay processes are used to study heterogeneous catalysis, and  
              occur with the techniques of electron- and x-ray microscopy and   lithography. 
              Insight provided by this knowledge may eventually produce   novel materials.
