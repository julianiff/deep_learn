              Abstract  ATM-9526139  Markgraf. Vera  University of Colorado  Title:
              Coordination of PEP I Research Activities    PEP I (Pole-Equator-Pole, the
              paleoclimate transect of the  Americas)is a PAGES/IGBP research initiative in
              the  organizational  and planing stages.  Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental
              records  contain information on the natural variability of the earth's past 
              environments and climate and provide a framework for assessing the  validity of
              future global climate change predictions and for  understanding mechanisms of
              past climate changes.  A scientific  agenda for interhemispheric paleoclimate
              research has been  formulated.  An international working group for PEP I will 
              implement the science program.  This award will support:  1. annual  meetings
              to coordinate working group activities, especially in  terms of enhancing
              cooperation in North and South America in the  past global change arena; 
              2.coordination efforts for maintaining  communication among the researchers,
              working groups, funding  agencies (such as IAI) and other global change
              programs; and  3.  facilitate coordination of research meetings on specific PEP
              I  research themes.
