Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for travel and other conference  expenses for
              students to attend the Chapman Conference on Magnetic  Storms; February 12-16,
              1996; Pasadena, California.  The emphasis  of this meeting is the study of all
              facets of magnetic storm  research, including causative phenomena at the Sun
              and  interplanetary space, magnetospheric processes and dynamics during 
              storms, storm/substorm relationships, ionospheric-thermospheric  effects,
              ground effects, and a session devoted to storm  forecasting.***
