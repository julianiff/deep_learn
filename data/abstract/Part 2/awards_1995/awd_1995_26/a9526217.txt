Abstract    :
              9526217  Pocanic  Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics. 
              The central activity is a high precision pion beta-decay  experiment which will
              be performed at the Paul Scherer Institute  in Switzerland.  This measurement
              will provide new limits on  possible other generations of quarks and leptons. 
              Research will  also be carried out at LAMPF, studying pion-pion interactions 
              needed as critical input in tests of chiral perturbation theory,  at SLAC, in
              the area of spin structure function measurements, and  at CEBAF, including work
              on nucleon structure and phi-meson  physics.  Development work will be carried
              out for the purpose of  producing a fast, high-resolution detector system
              suitable for  the pion beta decay experiment's high data rates.  Research in 
              the above areas will advance our understanding of the underlying  quark model
              of nucleons and mesons.  These topics are among the  most exciting in nuclear
              physics.  Education of graduate students  and postdocs is integral to this
              activity, as is development and  construction of major state-of-the-art
              equipment  ***
