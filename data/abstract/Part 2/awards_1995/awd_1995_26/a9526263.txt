Abstract    :
              9526263  Gehrels      The ACCRETE program is a collaborative endeavor to
              determine how  continents grow by magmatic and terrane accretion, and to 
              investigate the relative roles of these processes.  This award is  part of a
              project which involves a three year coordinated  geophysical and geological
              study of mid-Mesozoic to mid-Cenozoic  continental growth by accretion.  The
              goal is to develop a four  dimensional (X,Y,Z,and time) understanding of
              accretionary  processes along the portion of the northwestern margin of North 
              America underlain by the Coast Mountains orogen, British Columbia  and
              southeastern Alaska.  Specifically, the project involves a  transect of the
              orogen close to the British Columbia-Alaska border.   A geophysical pilot
              project along this transect in the summer of  1994 resulted in over 1700 km of
              new marine MCS (Multi-Channel  Seismic), gravity and magnetic data, and common
              receiver gathers  from 60 REFTEK seismometers.  Building on the high quality of
              this  geophysical data base, the Principal Investigators propose a group  of
              studies designed to construct  a 400 km cross section of the  orogen through
              the entire crust and into the upper mantle.  To  accomplish this, they must
              resolve fundamental questions regarding  how continental crust is formed during
              terrane accretion.  ***
