Abstract    :
              9526660  van Keken      The PI proposes numerical studies of the rheological and
               thermodynamic properties of the lower mantle and the role of the  400- and
              670- km phase transitions in lower mantle viscosity  models.  The goal of this
              research is to further our current  understanding of the importance of the
              lower mantle in governing  the dynamics and long term chemical and thermal
              evolution of the  mantle.  This work may help to better understand the fate of 
              subducted slabs, the source of hotspot volcanism, the geochemical  record
              explained by upper/lower mantle mixing, and will aid the  interpretation of
              tomographic seismic images by applying dynamical  considerations.  ***
