                Abstract  ATM-9526666  Richard N. Mower  Central Michigan University  UNIDATA:
               Networked Workstations for an Undergraduate Meteorology  Laboratory.    Funds
              will expand the capabilities of the undergraduate meteorology  laboratory
              through the acquisition of five networked workstations.   The proposed
              expansion will enable the program to make the  transition to UNIX from a single
              OS/2 workstation and will allow  access to a wider range of products available
              through UNIDATA via  Internet Data Distribution (IDD).
