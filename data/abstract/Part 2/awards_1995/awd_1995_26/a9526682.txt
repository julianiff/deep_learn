Abstract    :
              9526682  Johnson   Lava flows, marine sediments and magnetic anomaly data will
              be used to model the long term structure and variability in the geomagnetic
              field.  Data from both lava flows and sediments indicated different average
              field configurations during normal and reverse polarity periods for the past
              5Ma, although the individual models based on each type of data are poorly
              constrained.  The PI's propose to investigate how long a time interval is
              required to sample the full range of secular variation to get a good average of
              the geomagnetic field.   The PI's will also use paleointensity data to derive
              new paleosecular variation models.  Existing paleointensity data are
              incompatible with the current model of Constable & Parker, that is isotopic in
              variability with respect to any geocentric coordinate system.  New models will
              sought, using evolutionary programming, that allow for anisotropy along the
              geographic axis.  Very long-term (millions of years) non-zonal structure in the
              geomagnetic field, that may reflect control by core-mantle boundary conditions
              will be investigated by looking for anomalies in the time-averaged field and
              the paleosecular variation that correspond to similar structures seen in the
              historical field.
