Abstract    :
              9526622  Webster  The proposed research will provide knowledge of the behavior
              of chlorine in the degassing of mafic and intermediate magmas.  Projects to be
              undertaken include determination of:  (a) the solubility of chlorine in
              anhydrous molten basalt and andesite as a function of major element
              composition, pressure and temperature, (b) the partitioning of chlorine between
              melt and H2O and H2O-CO2 fluids as a function of pressure from 250 to 2000
              bars, and over a wide range of chlorine concentrations, and (c) chlorine
              partitioning between melt and apatite.  Experiments will be conducted in
              internally heated pressure vessels, rapid-quench externally heated TXM pressure
              vessels and evacuated silica tubes suspended in a vertical muffle furnace.  The
              data will be used to model the evolution of hydromagmatic fluid during
              crystallization of mafic magmas, to better deduce pre-eruption volatile
              budgets, to develop theoretical models of volcanic degassing, and to better
              estimate the capacity of magmatic gases to transport metals within the upper
              crust and volcanic edifices.
