Abstract    :
              9526911  Sheehan    This research and teaching grant is to study seismic
              estimates of sharpness and depth distribution of mantle discontinuities which
              are important for constraining models of composition and temperature in the
              Earth.  Seismic data for oceanic regions have been sparse to address this
              problem but new stations coming online or planned will help to fill this gap. 
              The work will include assembly of data sets from permanent island stations,
              temporary island stations, and temporary ocean bottom seismic deployments and
              application of multiple techniques for determining the sharpness and lateral
              variation of crust and upper mantle discontinuities.  The undergraduate
              teaching efforts will bring Internet and multimedia resources into the
              classroom, and bring development of a new geophysical field course utilizing
              resources from a previously funded NSF instrumentation grant.  This grant is a
              component of the NSF CAREER program.
