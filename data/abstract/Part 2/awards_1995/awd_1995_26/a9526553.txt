Abstract    :
              Coe  9526553   The paleomagnetic record of a geomagnetic field reversal from
              Steens Mountain basalt flows has provided valuable insights into the behavior
              of the reversing geodynamo.  However, the PI's controversial discovery of
              large, systematic variation of remanence direction as a function of
              demagnetization temperature and vertical position within individual flows is
              explained quite well by a hypothesis that invokes brief episodes of
              astonishingly rapid field change during the reversal.  If true, however, it has
              significant implications for the geodynamo, the core, and mantle--rates of
              change of field at the earth's surface three orders of magnitude larger than
              currently observed, fluid velocities at the top of the core much larger than
              currently modeled, and very low and/or laterally inhomogeneous electrical
              conductivity of the lower mantle.   The implications of these findings are
              central to the field of paleomagnetics.  The PI proposes to undertake further
              stringent tests of his hypothesis, and, if it is not supplanted by a better
              alternative, to provide a more complete and accurate description of the changes
              in direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic field during cooling of the
              individual flows.   He also plans to fill in and greatly extend the Steens
              Mountain record below the transition zone in order to check for precursory
              signals and to better establish the character of the pre-transitional field.
