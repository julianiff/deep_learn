Abstract    :
                  The investigators will perform a detailed analysis of the transport  process
              at the magnetopause.  The magnetopause is a complex  boundary which separates
              the shocked solar wind from the Earth's  magnetosphere.  Understanding the
              processes by which plasma crosses  the boundary remains a key problem in
              magnetospheric physics.   Since the reconnection process is the dominant means
              of transport  at the magnetopause, most of the effort will be directed at the 
              understanding of the role of collisionless tearing/coalescence  instabilities
              as an onset mechanism for reconnection and the  resulting transport.  By
              incorporating effects such as velocity  shear and thermal anisotropies, a much
              better understanding of the  reconnection process at the magnetopause can be
              gained.  The  primary tools for the investigation are state-of-the-art kinetic 
              numerical simulations and a linear particle-in-cell code.
