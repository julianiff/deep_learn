Abstract    :
              9526916  Smyth  The proposed research is to investigate the crystal chemistry of
              hydroxyl substitution in a group of representative silicates.  Several mineral
              structures will be refined by x-ray and/or neutron single crystal methods at
              various temperatures in order to test critical aspects of an electrostatic
              model for prediction of physical and chemical properties of hydroxyl-bearing
              silicates.  H positions determined by x-ray and neutron diffraction will be
              compared to see if systematic differences are present that would allow use of
              x-ray data to estimate proton positions.  Electrostatic site potentials will be
              computed for both x-ray and neutron h positions to see if systematic relations
              exist with IR data, relative thermal expansion of various nearest neighbor
              distances, 18O/18O and D/H fractionation and chemical weathering rates.  These
              studies will hopefully improve the predictive capability for physical and
              chemical properties of hydroxyl-bearing silicates and may yield a constraint on
              the H flux returning into the mantle.
