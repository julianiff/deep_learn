Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9526913  Murcray  This project makes use
              of the infrared absorption and emission  characteristics of important
              atmospheric constituents, especially  many of those which are involved in the
              chemical destruction of  stratospheric ozone.  Examples include both
              chlorofluorocarbon-11  and 12, ozone, nitric oxide, nitric dioxide, nitric
              acid, nitrous  oxide, chlorine nitrate, hydrogen chloride and many more.  A
              very  high resolution Michelson interferometer will be operated at  McMurdo
              which will make measurements of some 30 chemical species  in absorption using
              the sun as a source of infrared radiation.  Another Michelson interferometer,
              with higher sensitivity but  lower resolution, will continue to be operated at
              South Pole in  the emission mode, which allows it to measure a number of 
              important trace species throughout the entire year, especially  during the long
              winter darkness. This is especially important for  understanding the conditions
              leading up to the annual ozone hole.    This project is jointly supported by
              NSF's Divisions of Polar  Programs and Atmospheric Sciences and by NASA's
              Office of Mission  to Planet Earth,  ***
