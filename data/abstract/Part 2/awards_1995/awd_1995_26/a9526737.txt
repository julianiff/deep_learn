Abstract    :
              9526737  Bejczy  The International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR) has 
              consistently maintained an extremely high standard and has  drawn the most
              outstanding researchers in autonomous vehicle  disciplines.  This years
              conference promises to continue  this high standard while covering the subjects
              of interest  to the Ocean Engineering community.  In addition, the  Conference
              will cover subjects of interest to the other  programs in the Division.  These
              include computer controlled  surgery, telemedicine, environmental monitoring
              and control,  and teleoperations.  It is important to have participants  from
              the United States.    Professor Bejczy has been active in the area for many
              years  and has an international reputation in the field of robotic  control. 
              He has been invited to present a paper on "Virtual  Reality in Telerobotics". 
              This paper will contribute to the  general tone and information exchange at the
              Conference.  ***
