Abstract    :
              Abstract:  The planning grant will be used to survey perthite microtextues from
              a variety of high-grade metamorphic rocks in the Adirondack Mountains.  By
              relying on the well-documented metamorphic and igneous rocks of the
              Adirondacks, which record a wide range of pressure, temperature, and
              deformational regimes, it should be possible to document the textural and
              chemical behavior of alkali feldspars over a range of conditions.  By revealing
              the details of chemical exchange and possible development of intracrystalline
              networks of micropores, this study will target possible limitations on the use
              of alkali feldspars in studies of stable isotope exchange, radiometric dating,
              geothermometry, geobarometry, weathering, permeability development, deformation
              mechanisms, etc.    Samples from carefully selected localities in the
              Adirondacks will be analyzed by optical microscopy, a unique etching/SEM
              technique developed by the PI, and ultimately by TEM and electron microprobe. 
              Part of the work will be carried out at the home institution and/or nearby
              labs, while a significant part will be done at Edinburgh University (where all
              necessary facilities are available at one location) during the PI's junior
              faculty leave.    Once the feasibility of the methods has been tested, the PI
              will design an intensive study of one or more areas in the Adirondacks, and
              submit a full research proposal to EAR.      9
