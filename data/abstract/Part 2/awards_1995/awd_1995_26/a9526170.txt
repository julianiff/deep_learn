Abstract    :
              9526170  Chen  This project is to organize and  conduct a joint U.S.-Japan
              Seminar  on "Advanced Stability Concepts and  Methods for Seismic Design in 
              Structural Steel."  The seminar  will focus on advances in the state- 
              of-the-art achieved in the last few  years, with major emphasis on 
              achievements resulting from the  experiences of and research  subsequent to the
              Northridge and  Great Hanshin Earthquakes.  It will  culminate in the
              production of a  monograph which is hoped will serve  as a state-of-the-art
              guide to  analysis and design for seismic  retrofitting and new construction 
              in steel. The seminar and monograph  will reveal weaknesses and voids in 
              current American and Japanese  practices as well as new  technologies that are
              the most  promising for improving seismic  performance.  They will foster 
              change to eliminate these  deficiencies from current standards  and
              specifications and provide new  design concepts and methodologies.    This
              activity is a part of US-Japan  cooperative science program  administered
              jointly by the  International Division of NSF and  Japanese Society of
              promotion of  Sciences (JSPS).  ***
