Abstract    :
              9526238  Ardell    Several new aspects of the coarsening of gamma prime type 
              precipitates (Ni3X, X = Al, Ga, Ge or Si) in binary Ni-X  alloys are pursued
              during the course of this research.  These include:  (1) further studies of
              anomalous  coarsening kinetics at small volume fractions, fv; (2)  quantitative
              characterization of the evolution of the  concave cuboidal morphology that
              gamma prime precipitates  attain when fv is  small, and characterization of the
              spatial correlations  that eventually lead to rafting in nickel-base
              gamma/gamma  prime alloys; (3) investigations of gamma prime coarsening  at
              lower temperatures (T < 550 C) using magnetic analysis  to measure
              quantitatively the influence of coherency  strains and fv on the equilibrium
              coherent solubility  limits in Ni-X alloys, including Ni-Ti alloys.  It is also
               proposed to initiate a new project on the coarsening  kinetics of Al3Sc
              precipitates in binary Al-Sc alloys.  The principal methods of analysis are
              dark-field  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), image-analyzing  software
              applied to scanned TEM negatives, magnetic  analysis to measure the variation
              of the solute  concentration of the matrix during gamma prime coarsening  in
              Ni-base alloys, and electrical resistivity to make  comparable measurements in
              Al-Sc alloys.  %%%  This research has relevance to microstructural formation 
              and stability in high temperature metallic alloys.  The  emphasis is  on 
              binary  nickel-base alloys, the principal  base  for superalloy development.
