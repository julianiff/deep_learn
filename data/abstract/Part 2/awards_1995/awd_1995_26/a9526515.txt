Abstract    :
              9526515  Chou  The goal of the proposed research is to experimentally
              demonstrate an innovative ultra-high frequency polarization-switching
              vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (PS-VCSEL) that we have proposed
              recently  1 .  the innovative laser is based on our recent development of the
              artificial quarter-wave plates that employ nanoscale amorphous silicon gratings
              with periods less than the wavelength of light (i.e.: subwavelength)  2 . The
              unique feature of the subwavelength-grating quarter-wave plate is that its
              birefringence is over three orders of magnitude higher than that in a natural
              birefringence crystal such as quartz.  Therefore, use of such
              subwavelength-grating quarter-wave plate will reduce the extended cavity of
              PS-VCSEL by three order of magnitude and increase the oscillation frequency by
              three orders of magnitude.  ***
