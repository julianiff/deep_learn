Abstract    :
              9526344  Halliday  This project will develop the new technique of ICP magnetic
              sector multiple collector mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) for application in two
              areas of relevance to petrology and geochemistry - higher resolution
              geochronology and precise in situ isotopic measurements.  MC-ICPMS combines the
              advantages of very efficient plasma ionization with the precision of multiple
              collector magnetic sector mass spectrometry.  The addition of a laser
              facilitates studies for which spatial resolution is needed.  The P.I.s will
              focus their development work in new techniques that provide a capability not
              well duplicated by other methods.  In particular, high sensitivity U-Th
              measurements on low 230Th/232Th samples, Hf isotopic studies of small samples
              and high precision in situ laser Sr, Pb, and Hf isotopic measurements will be
              made with MC-ICPMS.  In the first instance the P.I.s propose using these
              methods for Sr and Pb isotopic studies of fluid inclusions, elucidating
              magmatic histories using high precision in situ isotopic measurements, U-Th
              disequilibrium studies of igneous systems, Hf isotopic studies of zircons and
              the determination of P-T-time paths using microscopic mineral inclusions.
