Abstract    :
                  This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  supports
              initial explorations of the use of acoustic conduction  properties to
              differentiate among materials.  The focus of the  exploration is an initial
              determination of the potential for the  acoustics-based approach to produce
              useful information about  material properties, while invariant to object shape.
               Useful  analogs will be sought from results on visual invariants. If it is 
              found that there are acoustic features that are shape invariant,  then
              longer-term research in this area may lead to new robotic  sensing systems with
              more capabilities for guiding materials  handling opreations.
