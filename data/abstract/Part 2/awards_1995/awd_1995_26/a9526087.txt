Abstract    :
              This project will further explore the plasma emission phenomenon.  Central to
              many radio emission phenomena within the heliosphere and beyond, the study will
              benefit many other related processes, including type II and type III bursts
              from the sun and interplanetary space, radiation at the Earth's bow shock, and
              the radio emission from the boundary region between our heliosphere and the
              surrounding interstellar medium.  Topics related to the PI's theory that will
              also be studied are:  (1) effects of ambient magnetic field on the polarization
              of the radiation; (2) propagation and scattering of the radiation in
              interplanetary space; (3) quantitative modeling of the nonlinear mode
              conversion process of electrostatic to transverse wave; (4) particle-in-cell
              (PIC) simulation of the nonlinear beam instability; (5) self-consistent
              modeling of the nonlinear mode conversion process; (6) formulation and solution
              of nonlinear wave-particle kinetic equation; (7) simulation of electron 
              energization at the collisionless shock; and (8) radiation by the energized
              electrons at the collisionless shock.
