Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9526018  "Application of MDO to Infrastructure Planning on the 
              Wasatch Front"  PI:  Balling, R., Brigham Young University    The "Wasatch
              Front" is a metropolitan area of rapid growth  in Utah, with  about 1.5 million
              people in 70 cities along a narrow  corridor about 80  miles long and 5 to 15
              miles wide.  The coupled problems of  growth  management and infrastructure
              renewal for this area are  complicated.  This  research will address transfer
              of Multidisciplinary Design  Optimization  (MDO) technology to the planning and
              design problems  associated with  infrastructure renewal and growth management.
               The MDO  approach will give  individual agencies as much freedom as possible
              in making  planning/design  decisions while maintaining coordination between
              disciplines  so that the  overall system can be optimized.  MDO tools consist
              of  optimization and  search algorithms, support for sensitivity analysis, 
              approximate analysis  models, robust design support, and other decision support
               tools.    The research will be accomplished in a collaborative  relationship
              among  faculty from BYU, several departments in the Utah State  Government, the
               Wasatch Front Regional Council, and the Mountainlands  Association of 
              Governments.  The project will develop and generalize the  MDO methodology, 
              including development of a prototype application on a  subsystem of the 
              "Wasatch Front", and then continue with development of a  detailed 
              implementable plan for application of MDO to the larger  regional system.
