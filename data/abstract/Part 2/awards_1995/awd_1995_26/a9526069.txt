Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Ahmed H. Zewail of the California Institute of   Technology will
              continue a series of investigations in his research   program on the dynamics
              of molecular energy redistribution and reactions.    Four specific areas are
              planned for investigation: 1) Study of the   intramolecular vibrational energy
              redistribution (IVR) in reactive and   non-reactive systems with particular
              attention given to mode specificity,   its nature and time scale, the roles
              played by rotations and collisions,   and the influence of symmetry; 2) study
              of the reaction rates and   intermediates of elementary systems, emphasizing
              the effects of total   energy, mode specificity, and the role of angular
              momentum; 3) study of   the elementary dynamics in complex systems, with
              applications to organic   and organometallic systems; and 4) theoretical
              investigations of IVR,   reaction rates and molecular dynamics.  These
              investigations are at the forefront of contemporary physical   chemistry,
              dealing with fundamental aspects of chemical reactions and   dynamics on a
              molecular scale.
