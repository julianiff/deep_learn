Abstract    :
              95-26300  Reyes  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet 
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Reyes  will reduce,
              analyze, and interpret radio observations  carried out before, during, and
              after the event.  Most of  the observations were carried out with the
              University of  Florida Radio Observatory, the University of Chile Radio 
              Observatory, and Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory.  These data will be
              complemented with data gathered during  the week of the collision at radio
              observatories in Japan,  Tasmania, and Australia.    The objectives are to
              investigate possible effects of the  collision of the comet fragments on the
              mean peak flux  densities of the normal Jovian radio emission, and to 
              determine the locations of sources of mechanisms for  emission of radio bursts.
                 Finally, Dr. Reyes will compile and publish a catalog of the  observations.
