Abstract    :
              9526435  Ainley  The special opportunity of a cruise by the R/V Polar Duke, from
               Seattle to Punta Arenas, Chile, during July-August 1995, will be  utilized to
              increase the understanding of the distribution and  ecology of Southern Ocean
              seabirds wintering north of the  Antarctic.  The work will complement recently
              completed studies of  these species in Antarctic waters.  In the recent study,
              it was  determined that almost all of the open-water Southern Ocean species 
              vacate the Antarctic during winter.  The cruise will intercept  these species
              on their wintering grounds.  Another major project  objective, anticipating the
              initiation of the international  project, Southern Ocean Global Ecosystem
              Dynamics, will be to  intercalibrate methods that have been used to estimate
              seabird  densities in the Southern Ocean.  The comparison will provide 
              background against which the relative utility of methods can be  gauged.
