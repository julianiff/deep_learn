Abstract    :
              Woodward, Charles  95-26486    Dr. Woodward will address five research problems
              in the study of  classical novae evolution: (1) chemical abundances of nova
              ejecta  from coronal and forbidden emission line spectroscopy; (2) 
              determinations of the grain size distribution and mineral  composition of nova
              dust; (3) differences in the temporal  evolution of the broadband spectral
              energy distribution and  light curves in the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen vs
              oxygen-neon-  magnesium novae; (4) dynamical studies of nova ejecta; and (5) 
              measurements of the density and masses of the ejecta.  ***
