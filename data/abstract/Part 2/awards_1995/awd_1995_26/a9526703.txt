Abstract    :
              IRI-9526703  Chow, Randy  University of Florida  $50,000 - 12 mos    SGER:
              Inter-domain Authentication and Authorization for Large  Information Systems   
              The ultimate goal in this exploratory research is to develop  models and tools
              to facilitate the development of a secure  logical network in an untrusted
              physical environment.  Cooperative users should have the flexibility to define
              their own  security enforcement mechanisms and implementation, yet they must 
              also conform to the overall security policy of the system.  This  research will
              address the fundamental issues involved in  achieving this goal.  This
              capability is needed to permit  commercial and governmental users to take full
              advantage of the  recent technological advances in high speed computers, high 
              bandwidth communication, high capacity storage devices, and  Internetwork
              systems such as the world-wide web.  Both  coordination and security across
              autonomous domains (independent  system administrations) are required for
              large, distributed  information systems, particularly ones implementing
              multimedia  infoware designs, and increasingly available CSCW (Computer 
              Supported Cooperative Work) applications.
