Abstract    :
              The research goal is to model the dynamic vibratory motion of the vocal folds
              using an interactive, three dimensional vocal fold model, whose parameters can
              be adjusted by the researcher to interactively test new hypotheses concerning
              voice production.  The methodology includes spectral shaping and noise modeling
              of fricatives, plosives and affricatives as well as nonlinear dynamic modeling
              of vocal fold motion.  A major motivation for this model is that imaging and
              other methods for measuring aspects of vocal fold vibratory motion are
              difficult tasks that involve probes inserted into the throat.  The vocal fold
              model will be tested using an articulatory speech synthesizer developed by the
              author under previous NSF sponsorship.  The significance of this interactive
              model is that its features and parameters can be modified and are related to
              physiological characteristics of the speech production process.  Three
              applications for the research results are training aids for the hearing
              impaired, methods to improve the design of speech production systems for the
              vocally impaired,  and improved speech coding based on articulatory movement.
