Abstract    :
                Proposal Number:  CTS-9526149  Koch     The overall aim of this project is to
              obtain a better understanding of packed bed performance at moderate Reynolds
              number through  theoretical and numerical analysis.  The equations of  fluid
              flow through periodic  and  random arrays of spheres and cylinders will be
              solved using the lattice-Boltzman cellular automation approach.  This will be a
              collaborative effort between Professor Donald L. Koch and Dr. Anthony J.C. Ladd
              of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.  The proposed approach is a
              rigorous one, which can readily be expected to produce new insight  and a 
              considerable body of reliable data for future benchmarking and qualitative
              comparisons.       The proposed efforts are both theoretically interesting and
              of considerable practical relevance.  Packed beds are the most common type of
              reactor used in the chemical industry.  The design of these reactors is
              influenced by pressure drop, heat and mass transfer from particles in the flow
              and the heat and mass diffusion within the fluid phase.  While an extensive
              body of experimental data is available for these phenomena, there is a dearth
              of theoretical analysis  on the fluid flow and transport processes in packed
              beds at non-zero Reynolds numbers.      A graduate student will be supported
              for three years with the expectation that a Ph.D. thesis will result from this
              support.
