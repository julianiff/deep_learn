Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9526410  Williams  UC-San Diego      This accomplishments based
              continuation proposal focuses on the modeling of the detailed chemistry in
              various diffusion flames through the application of asymptotic-based techniques
              developed by the PI and is a logical extension of the work presently being
              carried out by the PI.  New flame systems to be investigated will include (1)
              higher hydrocarbon flames, (2) higher alcohol flames, (3) hydrogen flames
              containing halogens, and (4) nitrogen containing flames.  The production of the
              oxides of nitrogen in flames and the intrinsic stability and influences of
              strain will also be investigated.  Special attention will be paid to the
              derivation of useful reduced kinetic schemes.  The results will contribute to
              our knowledge of mechanisms of flame propagation, flame structure, flame
              instabilities and flame ignition and extinction.
