Abstract    :
              Moskowitz  9526812   The PI's propose to investigate the interrelation between
              micromagnetic structure and macroscopic magnetic behavior in magnetite,
              maghemite, and phase-coupled particles using magnetic force microscopy and
              magnetic property measurements.  The magnetic force microscope (MFM) is a
              high-resolution magnetic robe that can image micromagnetic structures on a
              submicron scale.  Magnetic oxide articles to be studied with the MFM will be
              produced using molecular-beam epitaxy and photolithography.  These advanced
              microfabrication techniques can synthesize single crystalline, single phase and
              phase-coupled particles with precise control over shape, size, and
              crystallographic orientations.  In this way, a systematic study of intrinsic
              domain patterns, domain wall structures, and other micromagnetic features as a
              function of particles size and crystallographic orientation within the
              pseudo-single domain (PSD) size range for magnetite (0.5-10 micrometer) will be
              accomplished.   This experimental program will provide critical experimental
              testing of theoretical micromagnetic models, provide new and important data on
              micromagnetic structures and rock magnetic properties of phase-coupled CRM
              samples, and advance our understanding of the physical basis of paleomagnetism.
