Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a research program of in-situ  synchrotron x-ray
              topographic studies of both undeformed single  crystal and polycrystalline ice
              and dislocation structures in  mechanically-tested bulk specimens.  The goal is
              to provide  fundamental information on dislocation behavior that will enable 
              modeling of the deformation of ice to move from the  phenomenological to the
              micromechanism based.  In-situ x-ray  topography will also be used to examine
              the effects of UV  radiation on dislocations in both pure and doped single
              crystal  ice.  This work will also contribute to further understanding of  the
              effect of UV radiation  on the mechanical properties of ice,  i.e. the
              photoplastic effect.
