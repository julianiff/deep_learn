               Rochester Institute of Technology  GOALI: Modulation Codes for Multiamplitude
              Recording Channels  Steven W. McLaughlin    This research is in the area of
              high density high data rate optical  recording.  The optical recording
              technology receiving the most attention  is magneto-optics.  While
              magnetic-optic drives are among the highest  performing in both storage 
              capacity and data transfer rate, their  performance is limited.  In particular
              no commercially available high data  rate (>40 Mbits/sec) digital recording
              system using a single head  magneto-optic (or magnetic or optical) disk exists.
               An optical recording  technology known as electron trapping optical memory
              (ETOM) developed by  Optex will be capable of providing single head data
              transfer rates in  excess of 100 Mbits/sec.  The ETOM material allows one to
              store multiple  signal amplitudes on the media as opposed to conventional
              saturation  magnetic or optical recording.  This project is a joint Optex and
              RIT  project in the development of modulation codes for the multiple amplitude 
              recording channel.  The codes considered include both runlength limited and 
              partial response techniques.  The principal investigator will spend time at 
              Optex.
