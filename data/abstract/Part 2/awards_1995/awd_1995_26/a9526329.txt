Abstract    :
              9526329  Walker  Despite its importance in understanding the chemical evolution
              of the Earth, the Os isotopic composition of the mantle is poorly constrained. 
              This is to continue characterization of the Os isotopic composition of various
              mantle domains through time, via the analysis of ultramafic rocks that are
              otherwise geochemically and isotopically well-characterized, and that have
              relatively high Os concentrations and low Re/Os ratios.  Specific targets for
              analysis will be ultramafic magmatic systems that represent upper oceanic
              lithospheric materials, and materials derived from likely mantle plumes.  Both
              whole rock samples and mineral separates will be analyzed from each location. 
              The resulting information should lead to:  1) a better understanding of how Os
              has evolved in plume and upper mantle reservoirs, and 2) provide insights into
              where Re and Os are sited in these types of rocks and what phases or
              combination of phases provide the most useful information about initial
              isotopic compositions.
