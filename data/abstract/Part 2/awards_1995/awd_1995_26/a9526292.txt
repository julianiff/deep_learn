Abstract    :
              95-26292  Chapman  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Chapman will focus on the
              luminous first seconds and minute of the fragment impacts -- when the fragment
              kinetic energies were converted into complex explosions, from which all other
              observed phenomena ensued.    The basis for his investigation will be imaging
              data obtained with NASA's Galileo spacecraft, combined with other relevant
              earth-based data sets.  As part of this work, Dr. Chapman and his team will
              reduce the full Galileo imaging data set.    The investigation's chief
              objectives are to understand the origin of the spikes in the impact light
              curves.  Questions that Dr. Chapman will address are these:  "Are the spikes
              due to the crashing of the comet fragments?"  "Were there additional fragments,
              in addition to the roughly 20 major ones?"  "Can the spikes be explained by
              multi-component models for the comet fragments?"  **
