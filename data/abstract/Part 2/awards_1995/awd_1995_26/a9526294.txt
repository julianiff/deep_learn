Abstract    :
              95-26294  Cochran  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Cochran proposes to
              analyze, model, and archive data obtained of the event with the telescopes of
              the University of Texas McDonald Observatory.    In particular, Dr. Cochran and
              his team members, both at the University of Texas and the University of
              Colorado, will analyze in detail the infrared and CCD imaging and spectroscopy
              data of the fireball that resulted from the impact of comet fragment R. 
              Furthermore, they will examine the data from the impacts of fragments F, U, and
              V for evidence of fireballs or plumes.    The goal is to determine the
              distribution of impact debris in the Jovian atmosphere; the origin of the
              material (cometary or Jovian); the impacts' effects on the vertical, zonal, and
              meridional winds in the Jovian stratosphere; the ultimate destruction processes
              of the material; and the amount of stratospheric water that accumulated over
              the impact sites.  **
