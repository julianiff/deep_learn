Abstract    :
              This research, funded under NSF's Urban Systemic Infrastructure solicitation,
              evaluates the influence of urban-infrastructure management structures on
              infrastructure quality and performance.  Management structure serves as a
              description of the overall decision-making framework for infrastructure
              investment and maintenance.  The research design consists of 10-12 case studies
              in transportation and water-resources infrastructure, complemented by
              statistical analyses of the key quantifiable relationships identified.    The
              major products of the research are:  (1) a framework for decision-making to
              improve infrastructure performance;  (2) an empirically based understanding of
              decision-making and management attributes that tend to enhance infrastructure
              performance;  and (3) a design for training and technology-transfer programs
              for infrastructure management.  In addition, the project outputs include the
              design of curriculum materials and the design of a workshop and training
              session for infrastructure managers.    The work will be performed by an
              multi-disciplinary team of engineers, social scientists, management scientists,
              and urban and environmental planners from (a) New York University's Robert F.
              Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and (b) Polytechnic University's Civil
              and Environmental Engineering Department, in conjunction with a number of
              participating infrastructure organizations.
