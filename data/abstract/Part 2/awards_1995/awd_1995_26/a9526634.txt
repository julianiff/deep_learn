Abstract    :
              Wang  9526634  The PIs propose experiments to measure the P-V-T equation of
              state of a range of upper mantle and transition zone materials at high
              pressures and temperatures.  These experiments will significantly improve the
              coverage of the thermal elasticity dataset for lower mantle phases and should
              improve mineralogical constraints on the composition of the upper mantle and
              transition zone.
