Abstract    :
              Tis research focuses on the removal of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from
              controlled atmospheres and process effluents.  The PIs will study the potential
              of microwave tradiation to enhance the adsorption and/or to assist in the
              regeneration of the sorbing solids.  The research will determine the effect of
              microwave radiation during adsortion and desorption of VOCs over oxide
              sorbents, specifically the PIs will look at zeolites for the removal of
              hydrocarbons (with and without heteroatoms, e.g., Cl) from air in the presence
              of water vapor.  The decomposition of VOCs induced by microwave radiation, the
              influence of microwave irradiation on the selectivity of adsorption and the
              efficiency of desorption, and the catalytic decomposition of VOCs will be
              explored. Zeolite sorbents with variable hydroxide contents, from hydrophobic
              to hydrophilic, will be used.  The frequency of the microwave radiation will be
              varied from 1-120 GHz with variable power to determine the efficiencies of
              these processes compared to the microwave sorption spectra of the sorbent and
              sorbate syste ms.  Three types of processes will be studied: (1) competitive
              adsorption in the presence of microwaves, (2) desorption induced by microwaves,
              and (3) decomposition of heteroatom VOCs catalyzed in part by microwave
              irradiation.  The focus is on the selective removal of VOCs from air or carrier
              gas and the sorption of limited mixtures of gases, including H2O, C6H12,
              CHxCl4-x, CH3COCH3, NO, NH3 and thiophene.  The adsorbents to be studied will
              be zeolites ZSM-5, Faujisites, and L zeolite with variation in hydroxyl content
              and modification to their hydroxyls by reaction, and. in addition, catalytic
              metals (e.g., Cu and Ni) will be cation exchanged into the lattice.
