Abstract    :
              9526802  Tartof  Heterochromatin comprises about thirty percent of the
              Drosophila chromosome. Position effect variegation (PEV) results when a
              euchromatic gene has been placed adjacent to a block of centromeric
              heterochromatin. Such PEV can be modified by dominant genes known as Enhancers
              of variegation and Suppresors of variegation. Those genes can be divided into
              two classes, I and II, depending upon their response to gene dosage. A putative
              clone of a class II gene will be positively identified and characterized by
              transformation and genetic analysis. If it is shown to be a class II gene,
              experiments can be designed to attempt to understand the regulating role of 
              heterochromatin on gene expression.  %%%  The position of a gene on a
              chromosome can determine its ability to be expressed. Most of the genes in a
              eukaryotic chromosome are found in loosely packed regions of DNA, called
              euchromatin, and if they are moved close to, or into, regions of densely packed
              DNA, called heterochromatin, either express at a low level in the first case or
              not at all in the second case. When a gene is inserted into a chromosome the
              level of expression can vary between cells and result in what is called
              position effect variagation. It is postulated that not only is the position of
              the gene a determining factor in its level of expression but that other genes
              called suppressors and enhancers can also act to modify the level of
              expression. A putative suppressor gene has been cloned and if characterization
              of that gene  supports its identity as such, experiments can be designed to
              attempt to understand the regulating role of the heterochromatin as well as the
              gene itself on other genes.   ***
