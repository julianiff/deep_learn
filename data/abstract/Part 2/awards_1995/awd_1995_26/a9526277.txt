Abstract    :
              In this project jointly funded by the Division of International Programs   and
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Charles Wight of the University of Utah will   collaborate with E. Y.
              Misochko of the Institute of Chemical Physics in   Chernogolovka, Russia.   In
              this program Fourier Transform infrared   (FTIR) and electron paramagnetic
              resonance (EPR) spectroscopies will be   used to study photochemical reactions
              of F and H atoms with simple   molecules in low-temperature matrices.  The
              expertise of the   investigators is complementary, with Wight responsible for
              the FTIR   experiments and Misochko for the EPR.  Through this collaboration
              these   researchers will be able to formulate a comprehensive description of
              hot   atom mobility, diffusion of thermalized atoms, and atom-molecule  
              reactions that occur in the restrictive environment of low-temperature  
              solids.  Thin layers of solid `noble gas` matrices at very low-temperatures are
              an   ideal vehicle for containing highly reactive or transient chemical  
              species so that they can be studied using a technique called matrix   isolation
              spectroscopy.  Using this technique the mechanisms by which a   number of
              chemical transformations occur can be unravelled and examined.    Examples of
              such reactions are polymerization, explosive decomposition,   and combustion. 
              Through this international collaboration, the   complementary resources of a
              Russian and an American investigator will be   combined to produce a more
              complete picture of these types of processes   than might be obtained by either
              scientist working alone.
