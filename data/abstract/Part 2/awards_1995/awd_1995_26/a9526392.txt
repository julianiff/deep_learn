Abstract    :
              9526392  Getting    This grant provides $136,670 in support of the  costs of
              developing a technique to measure the  absolute temperature of geological
              materials at  high-pressures in a recently developed gas-piston  cylinder
              apparatus at the University of Colorado.  Specifically, the technique, entitled
              Johnson  noise thermometry measures the electrical noise  generated in a
              resistor (thermocouple) at elevated  temperature.  Due to the chemically inert
              and  hydrostatic environment generated in the argon gas-  piston cylinder,
              delicate and complex  instumentation can be used in the cylinder to make 
              corrections for the effect of pressure on  thermocouple emf thus enabling
              measurement of  temperature that is independent of the pressure.  This
              development will significantly expand the  range of pressure (up to 6 GPa) for
              which  calibrated thermocouple temperature measurements  can be made.  ***
