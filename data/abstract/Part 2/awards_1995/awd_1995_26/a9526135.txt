Abstract    :
              9526135  ATCHLEY   The first Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Molecular
              Evolution will be held in Ventura, California on January 28 - February 2, 1996.
               Gordon Conferences have occurred for over 60 years and are important vehicles
              for fostering education and science among researchers with common interests in
              the fields of biological, chemical and physical sciences.  The specific aim of
              the conference on Molecular Evolution is to stimulate discussion and
              interactions among a broad spectrum of scientists interested in evolution at
              the molecular level.  The study of molecular evolution is fundamental to the
              life sciences and integrates research from molecular biology, genetics,
              developmental biology, cell biology, ecology, biochemistry, virology,
              biophysics, paleontology, biogeography, statistics, mathematics, computer
              science and medicine.  Twenty-nine invited speakers from North America, Europe
              and Japan will speak on topics as diverse as the origin and evolution of the
              AIDS virus, the mammalian Y chromosome, the evolution of gene networks, and
              mathematical models of change at the molecular level.  Gordon Conferences are
              noted for their capability to determine the direction of research in a given
              discipline for the next 5 to 10 years.
