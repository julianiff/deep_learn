Abstract    :
              9526375  Evans    This grant provides partial funding for an upgrade to the 
              University of Washington's electron microprobe (EMP) in the  Department of
              Geological Sciences.  Specifically, a PC-based  computer automation system and
              new electronics module would  replace a no longer supported and unreliable
              NORAN TN5500  computer and the TN5600 electronics which drive the sample stage 
              and wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDS).  This EMP  represents an
              important regional facility for geochemical  analyses in petrologic research
              and the replacement of a ten-year  old computer system that is beyond repair
              and currently poses  operational efficiency problems is a cost effective way to
              add  useful years of life to an expensive piece of analytical  instrumentation.
               Upgrading of this EMP will allow continued and  increased productivity for a
              number of researchers for studies in  geobarometry-thermometry, major element
              geochemistry and  thermodynamics of igneous and metamorphic minerals.  ***
