Abstract    :
                9526163  Wolf    This grant provides $54,476 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring equipment necessary to  complete a cold-seal hydrothermal
              experimental  petrology laboratory at Augustana College capable  of
              experimentation at upper crustal temperatures  and pressures.  This RUI request
              will allow the PI  to continue his post-doctoral research on the  behavior of
              large-ion lithophile elements (LILE)  and the distribution of halogens in
              silicic magmas  and will provide a unique opportunity for  undergraduate
              students to become involved in both  the laboratory techniques and scientific
              concepts  pertaining to experimental igneous petrology.  ***
