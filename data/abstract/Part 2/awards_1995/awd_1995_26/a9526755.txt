Abstract    :
              9526755  Neckers  The PI's program focuses on laser initiated 
              photopolymerization and technologies thereby enabled.  The  overall goal of the
              work is to understand all steps of the  complex processes from the light
              absorption and disposition  of the excited states formed initially from
              photoinitiators  and coinitiators through the chain of reactions leading to 
              solid photopolymer.  The immediate plans are to develop  photochemistries which
              can be used at optimal photospeeds at  longer wavelengths (>600 nm with
              emphasis on systems which  function at >670 nm).  To develop initiator systems
              soluble  in silicon acrylate and fluorocarbon acrylate monomers.  To 
              understand the structures of the crosslinked polymers formed  in
              photopolymerizations and to relate this to photoinitiator 
              chemistry/photophysics.  To continue synthetic studies in  non-oxygen
              containing silane monomers, to develop  photomethods for forming solid
              photopolymers from silane  monomers and prepolymers; and to engage in the 
              synthesis/development of initiators which function in non-  acrylate, silane
              monomer systems.  %%%  This research should aid in laying the foundation for 
              manufacturing of next-generation microelectronic circuits  through development
              of new photosensitive resist materials  and catalysts.  ***
