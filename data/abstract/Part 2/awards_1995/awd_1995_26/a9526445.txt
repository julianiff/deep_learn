Abstract    :
              EEC-9526445  El-Aasser    This award funds a collaborative research effort
              between the Industry University Cooperative Research Center at the University
              of New Mexico on Microengineered Ceramics and the Industry University
              Cooperative Research Center at Lehigh University on Polymer Interfaces.  The
              overall objective of this collaborative research is to gain a better
              understanding of the interfaces between particulates (ceramics at New Mexico
              and rubber at Lehigh) and epoxy polymers in order to control the thermal
              conductivity and fracture toughness of the resulting composite materials.  The
              University of New Mexico Center is investigating  boron nitride particulate
              surfaces, and the Lehigh University Center is investigating the effects of
              epoxy polymer chemistry and rubber surface characteristics on the interface
              between the boron nitride and rubber particulates and the epoxy resins.  The
              two centers are cooperating in the processing and characterization of both the
              particulates and the composites that are produced.  The physical and thermal
              properties of the composites are also being evaluated.
