Abstract    :
              9526411  Brown  Recent studies have shown that zirconium nitride can protect 
              stainless steel against seawater corrosion.  It appears that  the effcct is due
              to natural conversion of a thin layer of  the nitride to hydrated zirconium
              oxide.  Under an SGER  award a study will be made of various other refractory 
              nitrides for their potential use as corrosion protection  coatings.  Pourbaix
              diagrams will be constructed and  candidate materials for testing will be
              chosen from those  that have stable oxides or hydrated oxides at the pH and 
              open potential levels of seawater.  The selected nitride  coatings will be
              deposited by plasma arc methods and tested  for corrosion resistance by
              electrochemical techniques.  The  results may make it possible to replace
              chromate conversion  coatings with the environmentally more benign nitride 
              coatings.  ***
