Abstract    :
              This project is exploring new communication mechanisms that go beyond the 
              deadline guarantees of previous work in real-time and non-real-time message 
              streams, using models of real-time communication that can represent tolerance
              to  deadline misses.  For real-time message streams, these models suggest new 
              techniques for providing service guarantees on the frequency or clustering of 
              missed deadlines.  for non-real-time message streams, the models will be used
              to  develop support mechanisms that minimize average delivery delay subject to
              the  constraints of the real-time streams.  Simulation and analytic methods are
              being  used to evaluate competing techniques.
