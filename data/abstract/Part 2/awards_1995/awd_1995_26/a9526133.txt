Abstract    :
              9526133  Thorpe  The International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR) has 
              consistently maintained an extremely high standard and has  drawn the most
              outstanding researchers in autonomous vehicle  disciplines.  This years
              conference promises to continue  this high standard while covering the subjects
              of interest  to the Ocean Engineering community.  In addition, the  Conference
              will cover subjects of interest to the other  programs in the Division.  These
              include computer controlled  surgery, telemedicine, environmental monitoring
              and control,  and teleoperations.  It is important to have participants  from
              the United States.    Professor Thorpe has been active in the field of
              autonomous  undersea vehicles and is considered an outstanding  researcher.  He
              has participated in several activities  sponsored by the Ocean Engineering
              Program and can glean  relevant information as well as contribute to the 
              Conference.  His paper on the future of Mobile Robotics will  be an important
              part of the Conference  ***
