              Abstract  ATM-9526384  Miller, Gifford  University of Colorado  Title: PALE
              Steering Committee, Data Coordination, and Community           Radiocarbon
              Dating    This award supports activities that are central to the success of 
              Paleoclimates from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE), a project  within the
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Program, but which are  beyond the scope of
              individually funded research projects.  The  general contribution of PALE to
              the ARCSS program is the  description of temporal and spatial variations in
              late Quaternary  (150,000 years to present)  Arctic climates are determined by 
              multiple proxy indicators preserved in lacustrine and estuarine  sediment
              records.  These data, when coupled with paleoclimatic  models, provide a fuller
              understanding of possible mechanisms and  feedbacks that affect both
              circumarctic and regional high latitude  climate changes.  Such knowledge
              improves predictive capabilities  for assessing possible environmental
              responses to future climatic  fluctuations.  This award will support the
              activities of the PALE  Steering Committee for coordination among national and 
              international scientific programs.  A data coordinator is also  supported as
              being vital to PALE as the major facilitator for  compilation, storage, and
              exchange of data with other paleoclimatic  programs.  Support for radiocarbon
              analyses will ensure the high  quality chronologies necessary to PALE.
