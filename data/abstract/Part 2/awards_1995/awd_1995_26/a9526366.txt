Abstract    :
              9526366  Weingarten      As part of its new architecture for NSFNET, NSF is
              funding the  creation of a very High Speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS).  A 
              major role envisioned for the vBNS is to serve as a platform for  research on
              very high speed networking and networking applications.   Now that the vBNS
              project is underway, it is time for the research  community and those
              responsible for the vBNS  to begin a closer  dialog on what research can and
              will be done on the vBNS and how  the researchers will gain access to the
              infrastructure. The  Computing Research Association will sponsor a workshop to
              start  that dialog.  Approximately thirty researchers in networking and 
              applications, from academia and industry, will meet in Washington  DC on June
              22 and 23, 1995.  together with government agency  officials and vBNS designers
              and operators, they will discuss the  current and likely future research
              agendas in high speed networking  and the implications of those agendas for the
              vBNS as an  experimental environment.
