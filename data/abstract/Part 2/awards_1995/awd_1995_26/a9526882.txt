Abstract    :
              O'Connell  9526882   The PI proposes to model and study the development of
              subduction zones in the mantle.  Fluid dynamical models of the sinking of
              subducted lithosphere in the mantle will be developed, and applied to several
              subduction zones including South America, Tonga-Fiji, Izu Bonin-Marianas and
              Indonesia.  The object is to relate the dynamical, time dependent development
              of a subduction zone to the morphology and seismicity of the subducted slab and
              to the observed variations of seismic velocities in subduction zones (as
              revealed by seismic topography).  The work will also address whether
              significant amounts of subducted material penetrate into the lower mantle.    
              The work will develop and use three-dimensional dynamical models of the sinking
              of lithosphere at a subduction zone.  The models will include the effects of
              lithospheric plates, including realistic plate geometries that evolve with
              time.  Different types of models will be used in order to most efficiently
              address various problems.
