Abstract    :
              Abstract:    The proposed investigation of U-Pb dating of fluor-apatite conodont
              elements may provide a powerful geologic tool for linking biostratigraphic
              zones with absolute ages.   The combination eliminates the need to interpolate
              boundary ages from absolute ages derived from sporadically distributed igneous
              rocks.  This interpolation is one of the largest sources of error in current
              absolute geologic time scales.      For the pilot study proposed for this
              planning grant, the PI will date the stage boundaries in the Early Permian, a
              time when the nomenclature and stratigraphic positions of stage boundaries are
              generally agreed upon, and for which the PI can obtain abundant conodonts.  If
              successful, the PI will submit a major proposal to extend the approach into the
              Late Permian, a time when the stage boundaries and duration of stages are
              subject to constant debate.  Resolution of the Late Permian stratigraphic
              controversies is of particular interest because the time period includes the
              most extensive Phanerozoic mass extinction, the lowest sea level stands, the
              end of the Kiaman Reversed Period, and very rapid apparent rates of change in a
              number of geochemical parameters.    Success of this project will give the PI
              an important new tool to enhance her existing research, which focuses on the
              interpretation of global climate change recorded by isotopic variations
              preserved in marine organisms.
