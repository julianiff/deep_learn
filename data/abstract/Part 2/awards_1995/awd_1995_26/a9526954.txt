Abstract    :
              9526954  Willett   The objective of this research is to construct an improved
              orogenesis model and conduct numerical experiments that will reveal the nature
              and strengths of feedback between tectonic deformation and surface processes in
              evolving mountain belts.  The experiments will be guided by a dataset of
              geologic and topographic observations of active mountain belts, collected both
              from the literature and digital elevation models.  To accomplish this
              objective, two extant surface-processes models (SPMs) will be synthesized, and
              a new model constructed that accounts for orographic climate, chemical
              weathering, and alpine glaciation.  The macrogeomorphology and exhumation
              patterns of a few carefully selected mountain belts will be predicted using the
              coupled model and the results tested against observations.  The ultimate
              outcome of this research should be an improved underqtanding of the nature and
              strengths of feedback between tectonic deformation and surface processes in
              evolving mountain belts.
