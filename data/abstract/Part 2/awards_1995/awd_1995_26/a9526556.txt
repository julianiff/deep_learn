Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program to reconstruct records of  the isotopic
              composition of paleoatmospheric methane and nitrous  oxide covering the last
              200,000 years.  High resolution  measurements of the carbon-13 isotopic
              composition of methane  from shallow ice cores will help to determine the
              relative  contributions of biogenic (wetlands, rice fields and ruminants)  and
              abiogenic (biomass burning and natural gas) methane emissions  which have
              caused the concentrations of this gas to increase at  an exponential rate
              during the anthropogenic period.  Isotopic  data on methane and nitrous oxide
              over glacial/interglacial  timescales will help determine the underlying cause
              of the large  concentration variations that are known to occur.  This project 
              will make use of a new generation mass spectrometer which is  capable of
              generating precise isotopic information on nanomolar  quantities of methane and
              nitrous oxide, which means that samples  can be 1000 times smaller than those
              needed for a standard  isotope ratio instrument.  The primary objective of the
              work is  to further our understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of  these
              two greenhouse gases throughout the anthropogenic period as  well as over
              glacial interglacial timescales.
