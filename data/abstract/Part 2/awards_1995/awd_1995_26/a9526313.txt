Abstract    :
              95-26313  Pryor  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Pryor proposes to analyze,
              model, and archive data obtained of the event with the telescopes of the
              University of Texas McDonald Observatory.    In particular, Dr. Pryor and his
              team members, both at the University of Colorado and the University of Texas,
              will analyze in detail the infrared and CCD imaging and spectroscopy data of
              the fireball that resulted from the impact of comet fragment R.  Furthermore,
              they will examine the data from the impacts of fragments F, U, and V for
              evidence of fireballs or plumes.    The goal is to determine the distribution
              of impact debris in the Jovian atmosphere; the origin of the material (cometary
              or Jovian); the impacts' effects on the vertical, zonal, and meridional winds
              in the Jovian stratosphere; the ultimate destruction processes of the material;
              and the amount of stratospheric water that accumulated over the impact sites.
