Abstract    :
              The American Mathematical Society will hold the twenty-sixth AMS-SIAM Summer
              Seminar in Applied Mathematics in 1996.  Previous  seminars were held annually
              or at two- or three-year intervals  since 1957 for a total of 25 seminars.   
              The 1996 topic, "Mathematics of Stochastic Manufacturing  Systems", was
              selected by the 1994 AMS-SIAM Committee on Applied  Mathematics.    Members of
              the Organizing Committee for the Summer Seminar are:    George Yin- Department
              of Mathematics, Wayne State University,  Chair    Qing Zhang- Department of
              Mathematics, University of Georgia, Co-Chair    John Birge- Department of
              Industrial and Operations Engineering,  University of Michigan    Wendell
              Fleming- Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown  University    Bozenna
              Pasik-Duncan- Department of Mathematics, University of  Kansas    Marty
              Riemann- AT&T Bell Laboratories     All of the members of the organizing
              committee have agreed to  attend and participate in the meeting.    The 1996
              AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar will be held during a one-week  period in June, 1996,
              at a location in the Eastern United States.   The Society will be responsible
              for making suitable arrangements  for lecture and seminar rooms, and for
              handling administrative  matters.
