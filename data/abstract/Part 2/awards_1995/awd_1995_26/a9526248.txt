Abstract    :
              9526248  Klemperer  This award provides partial support for the 7th
              International Symposium on Deep Seismic Profiling of the Continents.  This is a
              biannual meeting of the international community of controlled-source
              seismologists specializing in near-vertical reflection methods, together with
              specialists in wide-angle refraction methods, and experts in tectonics,
              composition and evolution of the continental crust.  The 7th Symposium will be
              jointly hosted by Stanford University and by the USGS, Branch of Seismology. 
              About 250 international delegates are anticipated to attend the five-day
              meeting, and a peer-reviewed conference volume will be published in
              Tectonophysics one year after the meeting.  ***
