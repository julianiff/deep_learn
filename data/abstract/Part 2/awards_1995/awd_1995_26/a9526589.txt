Abstract    :
              9626589  Jacobson   The Palona, Orocopia and Rand Schists are Late
              Cretaceous-early Tertiary subduction zone rocks in southern California and
              southwestern most Arizona.  These rocks were emplaced beneath the mesozoic arc
              of western North America along the vicent-chocolate mountain thrust, according
              to one model, originating during low-angle, east-dipping subduction.  Thus the
              model implies top to the west sense of movement.  However, many studies have
              documented top to the east movement on many exposures of the fault, which due
              to subduction, would reverse subduction polarity and create several geometric
              problems for Loramide tectonics.  Recent work has indicated that many of these
              "wrong way" kinetic indicators may be due to later, normal faulting
              reactivation of  the thrust surface.  This project will focus on this possible
              reactivation and will attempt to date the movement.  Successful results will
              help finally resolve one of  the main controversies of  the Cretaceous tectonic
              geometry of  the southwest margin of North America, and illuminate the  younger
              extensional event.
