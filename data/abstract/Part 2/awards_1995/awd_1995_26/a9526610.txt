Abstract    :
              9526610  Baker  The proposed research program is a continuation of an 
              interdisciplinary approach to chemical ecology.  The  objectives in a broad
              sense are the characterization and  quantification of chemically mediated
              ecological  relationships among antarctic benthic invertebrates.  There  are
              several specific objectives to investigate during two  field seasons.  Research
              will involve an evaluation of  chemical defenses in adult antarctic marine
              invertebrates  and  also early life history stages.  Investigators will 
              evaluate lecithotrophic eggs, embryos and larvae for  bioactivity.  This is
              particularly relevant as many  Antarctic invertebrates broadcast conspicuous
              lecithotrophic  embryos and larvae which require two to six months to  develop
              while in the plankton.  It has been observed  that  colored sponges use their
              pigments as defensive agents, and  their functional role will be investigated
              in sponges and in  other colored invertebrates. Furthermore, bioactive 
              metabolite concentration and sequestration will be  investigated in
              invertebrates from which secondary  metabolites have been isolated.  And
              finally work will  continue on the isolation and characterization of bioactive 
              compounds from invertebrates for the purpose of evaluating  their functional
              role. Significant aspects of the research  are the use of ecologically relevant
              bioassays to guide the  isolation, on-site at McMurdo Station, of the active 
              chemical agents, and subsequent characterization of those  metabolites at our
              home institutions. In summary, the  proposed program will make a significant
              contribution to the  understanding of the nature and role of bioactive agents
              in  the ecology of the Antarctic marine benthos.
