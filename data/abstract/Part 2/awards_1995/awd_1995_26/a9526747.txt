Abstract    :
              9526747  Clayton  Natural variations in the abundances of isotopes of the light
              elements oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen will be used to study a variety
              of geochemical and cosmochemical problems.  The fundamental thermodynamic basis
              of isotopic fractionation will be expanded by additional laboratory experiments
              and theoretical calculations.  These results will be applied to the
              determination of thermal histories of igneous and metamorphic rocks. 
              Particular emphasis will be given to rocks from the Earth's mantle in order to
              assess the degree of recycling of crustal rocks into the interior.  The origin
              of the earth and the nature of its raw materials will be studied through oxygen
              isotope abundances in meteorites.  The three-isotope method, developed at the
              University of Chicago, is a very powerful tool for establishing genetic
              relationships among the various constituents of the early Solar System.  This
              approach has shown that currently popular models for formation of the Earth are
              incorrect, or, at best, incomplete.
