Abstract    :
              9526939  White  This grant is to support 50% of the travel costs of 4  U.S.
              Scientists to the Geochemical Earth Reference Model Workshop to be held in
              Lyon, France in March, 1996.  The goals of this workshop are:  to define
              significant geochemical reservoirs, define the best estimates of elemental
              inventories of reservoirs and fluxes between them, and their uncertainties, and
              incorporate our best understanding of the physics of transport into one or more
              integrated reference models of long-term geochemical pathways.  The workshop
              will  be unique opportunity to break through traditional disciplinary
              boundaries, to foster collaboration among geochemists and geophysicists with a
              wide variety of backgrounds, and to take stock and define the current state of
              knowledge, and lack thereof, about the chemistry of the Earth.
