Abstract    :
              Bloxham  9526914   The PI proposes to study the dynamo process responsible for
              the generation of the Earth's magnetic field.  The focus of the work is on a
              numerical investigation of the work is on a numerical investigation of the
              dynamo process using a dynamically-consistent, three-dimensional dynamo program
              that the PI has recently developed and tested.   The fundamental question of
              the Earth's magnetic field is generated has only recently become accessible to
              modeling efforts as a consequence of development of advanced computer
              technologies.  Geodynamo models are also of great interest.  In solid earth
              geophysics because an understanding of care dynamics is essential to unraveling
              the complex process in the deep interior.
