Abstract    :
              This award is for support for the recovery of a 1000-meter ice  core from Siple
              Dome, Antarctica and the coordination of a  science management office for the
              scientific program.  The  proposed project is part of the West Antarctic Ice
              Sheet (WAIS)  program, which seeks to understand the current behavior of the 
              West Antarctic ice sheet and to decipher its past climate  history.  Siple Dome
              is located between ice streams C and D and  is well-situated to investigate
              coastal climate conditions and  the dynamics of the Siple Coast ice streams
              which drain the West  Antarctic ice sheet.  The annual accumulation at the site
              is 7 to  11 cm of ice per year and it is anticipated that annual layers  will
              be identifiable to an age of at least 6,000 years before  present.  The length
              of the usable climate record will extend to  at least 80,000 years before
              present.  This proposal provides the  background for the Siple Dome drilling
              program and develops the  opportunity for individual scientists (who have
              submitted  separate proposals) to work on the ice core .  This proposal  would
              establish a Science Coordination Office that would  coordinate the activities
              of the various organizations involved  in the project, including the National
              Science Foundation (NSF),  the Polar Ice Coring Office (PICO), Antarctic
              Support Associates  (ASA), and the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL).
