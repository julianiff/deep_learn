Abstract    :
                Abstract  ATM-9526665  Ronald W. Henderson  SUNY Albany  UNIDATA:  A Proposal
              for Hardware Support to Provide the National  Lightning Detection Network
              (NLDN) Data via the Internet Data  Distribution (IDD) System to University UCAR
              Members.    Funds will purchase a new computer for the Department of 
              Atmospheric Sciences at SUNY, Albany.  This machine will provide  the UNIDATA
              community with the National Lightning Detection Network  (NLDN) data.  This new
              facility will allow SUNY:  1) to increase  its capability to provide NLDN data
              via Internet Data Distribution  (IDD) to an increased number of sites, 2)  to
              provide an archive  site for NLDN data, and, 3)  to bolster SUNY's computer
              power to  allow the NLDN data to be processed adequately during times of  large
              numbers of lightning strikes.
