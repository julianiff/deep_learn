Abstract    :
              9526736  Storm  This proposal requests a grant of $6,000 in support of the 1995 
              Gordon Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers to be  held at the
              Tilton School, Tilton, New Hampshire, July 30 - August  4, 1995.  As in
              previous years, the purpose of this conference is  to provide an informal forum
              for the presentation and discussion of  new work on selected topics in
              nonlinear optics quantum electronics  and lasers, and their applications to
              physics, chemistry and  engineering.  An informal atmosphere with a strong
              emphasis on  discussion is intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a 
              manner not possible at regular meetings of professional societies.   Particular
              effort is made to provide an opportunity for graduate  students and postdocs to
              interact in this informal atmosphere with  foremost experts in the field.  A
              total attendance of approximately  135 scientists from universities, industry
              and government is  anticipated.  It is proposed that the estimated total
              expense for  the conference of 440,000 be shared by the National Science 
              Foundation ($6,000), the Office of Naval Research ($5,000), the Air  Force
              Office of Scientific Research ($10,000), the Army Research  Office ($4,000). 
              The remainder ($15,000) is obtained from  registration fees paid by Gordon
              Conference attendees.  The  National Science Foundation funds will be used to
              assist graduate  students and selected junior faculty who, because of
              limitations of  their own sources of funding, require financial assistance to 
              attend the conference.  No honoraria will be paid.  ***
