Abstract    :
              James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical work on   spectroscopy and
              relaxation in liquids and glasses.  Studies are proposed   in three major
              areas: 1) spectral diffusion of individual molecules in   glasses; 2) ultrafast
              solvation dynamics in liquids; and 3) vibrational   relaxation in liquids.   A
              combination of formal theory and simulations   is used to interpret dynamical
              information obtained from various spectral   measurements obtained from
              fluorescence probes in glasses and in   solution.  Amorphous solids or glasses
              have many important technological   applications.  Optical spectroscopy of
              dilute flourescent compounds has   been used to probe the dynamics of glasses,
              and to obtain a better   understanding of the thermal properties for such
              systems.  The dynamics   of liquid solvents plays an important role in many
              chemical and   biological rate processes.  Solvent dynamics can also be probed 
               spectroscopically using  dilute solutions of fluorescent compounds.    Finally
              vibrational relaxation is intimately involved in liquid-state   chemical
              reaction dynamics.  In order to predict reaction rates, one   therefore has to
              understand vibrational relaxation rates.   Skinner will   also be studying
              vibrational relaxation processes in dilute solutions.
