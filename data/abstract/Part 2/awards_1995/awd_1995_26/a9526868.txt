Abstract    :
                      9526868  Yeung      This award will support the travel costs, over a two
              year period,  to enable Dr. Pui-kuen Yeung of the Aerospace Engineering 
              Department at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and for  Catherine Moseley,
              a graduate student in the Department, to  conduct collaborative research with
              Dr. Michael S. Borgas from the  Division of Atmospheric Research of the
              Commonwealth Scientific  and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) located
              at  Mordialloc, Victoria.  The cooperative research will focus on  simulation
              and stochastic modeling of contaminant transport and  dispersion in turbulent
              airflows.    In air pollution problems the mean concentration region arising 
              from localized pollution sources is primarily determined by a  disorderly
              motion of fluid elements best described using the  Lagrangian approach of fluid
              mechanics.  The data, which are  difficult to measure, may be extracted from
              numerical simulations  of the exact, instantaneous momentum and scaler
              transport equations  in turbulence.  This research is of particular timeliness
              in  enhancing the development of stochastic models of turbulent  dispersion in
              the environment.  The CSIRO laboratory conducts a  large atmospheric research
              program, and that combined with the  parallel computing facilities available at
              the Georgia Institute  of Technology, will enable this study to be realized. 
              Support  in Australia is provided through the Department of Industry,  Science
              and Tourism (DIST).
