Abstract    :
              9526762  Barnes  The PI proposes to determine the rate constants and activation
              energies of the growth of pyrite from aqueous solutions. Measurements will be
              made at 100-300(C and pH from 2 below to neutrality. The flow-through method
              will be used where pressure vessels containing polysulfide or ferrous ammonium
              sulfate solutions, will be pumped into a reaction vessel containing pyrite seed
              grains about 1 mm in diameter. Reaction rate constants and activation energies
              will be measured as function of temperature, degree of supersaturation,
              polysulfide and other aqueous sulfur species, and pH. Applications of the
              resulting data are broad. They supply a quantitative basis for evaluating the
              flux of Fe and S into sediments, a major stage of their global cycles. The data
              also constrain the rates of formation of strongly magnetic greigite and of its
              reaction to form pyrite. From this information, the interpretation of
              paleomagnetic characteristics of sediments can be better understood where
              magnetite is absent to determine, for example, when the magnetic state was set
              and how it was preserved. An especially valuable application is to mineral
              exploration due to the high abundance of this mineral in ore-containing
              environments.
