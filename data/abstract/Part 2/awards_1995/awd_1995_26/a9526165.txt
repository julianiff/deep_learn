Abstract    :
                  9526165  Xu    This research project uses a unique combination of precursor 
              molecular structure and reaction dynamics to conduct  deposition and growth
              studies of multi-component  ferroelectric oxides.  The investigation focuses on
               autostoichiometric vapor depostion, which takes advantage of  the
              stoichiometrically associative double alkoxide  precursors, and deposition
              reactions that allow for the  conservation metal-to-metal ration during
              deposition.  Basic  understanding of various gas phase and surface reactions, 
              such as free-radical pyrolysis, hydrolysis-assisted  pyrolysis and
              hydrolysis-polycondensation, and their  implications on the stoichiometric
              nature of thin and thick  film deposition of ferroelectric materials. 
              Characterization methods employed include mass  spectrometric, X-ray, as well
              as optical scattering and loss  measurements of waveguide structures fabricated
              during the  project.  %%%  The knowledge and understanding gained from this
              research  project is expected to contribute in a general way to  improving the
              performance of advanced ferroelectric  materials and optoelectronic components
              used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications by providing
               a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved
              materials.  An important feature of the  program is the integration of research
              and education through  the training of students in a fundamentally and 
              technologically significant area.  ***
