Abstract    :
              95-26314  Nicholson  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Nicholson will investigate
              three related topics:  (1) The sequence of events and principal phenomena that
              resulted from the impacts, via comparative modeling of the light curves
              obtained from ground-based, Hubble Space Telescope, and Galileo observations;
              (2) the thermal and compositional response of the Jovian stratosphere to the
              larger impacts, using IR imaging spectroscopy; and (3) determination of the
              vertical distribution of the prominent impact-produced aerosols clouds, based
              on near-IR spectrophotometry.    The basis of this investigation will be data
              sets obtained at Palomar Observatory, Cal., and the Siding Spring Observatory,
              Australia.  **
