Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program of physical and visible  studies on the
              shallow and deep ice cores to be retrieved from  Siple Dome, West Antarctica. 
              Visible examination of ice cores  has proven to be a powerful technique for
              dating and  paleoclimatic interpretation.  Recent examination of a shallow 
              core from Siple Dome indicates that annual-layer dating is  possible and that
              visible examination will contribute  significantly to the dating effort at
              Siple Dome.  Once ages are  obtained, distances between layers provide snow
              accumulation  after correction for density variations and ice flow thinning. 
              Thin- section examination of the core will contribute to  understanding the
              visible stratigraphy, and will reveal c-axis  fabrics which are related to past
              ice deformation.  The results  of this study should include a better
              understanding of rapid  climate change in the Antarctic and should contribute
              to  knowledge of the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
