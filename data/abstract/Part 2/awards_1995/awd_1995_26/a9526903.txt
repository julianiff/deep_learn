Abstract    :
              9526903  Davidson  The details of differentiation (melting, fractional
              crystallization, magma mixing and contamination) in a given magma system are
              commonly difficult to decipher.  One particularly useful tool in identifying
              open system processes is the use of isotopic ratios.  Interaction between
              isotopically diverse components modifies the isotopic compositions of resulting
              differentiates, but bulk analyses of the rocks typically fail to identify the
              end members involved.  If vestiges of these components retain their physical
              identity (early-formed crystals from magmas that have subsequently hybridized,
              xenocrysts from assimilants, etc.) then they may also retain their original
              isotopic compositions.   Complications arise from the for continued - if not
              constant - growth phases through complex differentiation scenarios.  In
              principle, much of the evolutionary history of a magma system is locked into
              phases crystallizing from it.  Determining isotopic variations within these
              phases may help elucidate such histories, particularly when integrated with
              spatially correlated major and trace element data.  The P.I.s propose to
              improve on methods to perform such analyses, and outline some specific studies
              that may illustrate its potential.
