Abstract    :
                    Abstract  9526966  Parkinson      This proposal is a request for funds for
              a Gordon Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms.  This meeting
              will permit the participants to discuss recent developments and ideas on the
              molecular mechanisms of sensing and movement in unicellular systems including
              bacteria, fungi, slime molds and protozoa.    The format includes oral
              presentations and poster, and has a small number of participants, which is
              conducive to discussion among al the participants including established
              investigators as well as young scientists.   Such meetings are important for
              the exchange of information and ideas which can result in new directions in
              research.  ***
