              University  UNIDATA:  Internet Data Distribution Fail-Over, Relay, and Archive 
              Site at Colorado State University.    Funding will enable the Atmospheric
              Science Department at Colorado  State University (CSU) to participate in the
              Internet Data  Distribution (IDD) system, while continuing to receive data via
              the  KU-band system.  The requested equipment will enable CSU to  streamline
              data archive and retrieval.  This equipment may enable  CSU to become an IDD
              relay site.
