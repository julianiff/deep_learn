Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9526220  Magee    The New Jersey Institute of Technology's
              (NJIT) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Hazardous
              Waste Management is a multi-university Center involving NJIT, Rutgers
              University, Stevens Institute of Technology, Princeton University and the
              University Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.  The Center meets the criteria
              for the I/UCRC Program.    This award provides funding for a project in the
              Center studying the control of airborne toxic metals produced during hazardous
              waste combustion.  The continuous emission monitor (CEM) being studied is based
              upon photo-fragment fluorescence indicating the multiple metal concentrations
              in the exhaust stream in real time.  An instrument prototype will be tested at
              a pilot-scale incinerator.    Additional funding is provided to cover the
              additional administrative costs associated in collaborating four universities
              with New Jersey Institute of Technology.
