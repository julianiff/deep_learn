Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    OPP-9526071  Forman    Recommendations of an earlier workshop
              entitled "Defining Research  Priorities for Arctic Land-Shelf Interactions"
              will be implemented  with this award.  The arctic shelves are critical areas
              for the  flux of water and ice that modulate the global climate and those 
              fluxes are controlled partly by the freshwater runoff into the  Arctic Ocean. 
              A workshop of U.S. scientists will be convened to  write a science plan for
              implementation of a global change research  program addressing human adaptions
              and land-shelf biogeochemical  fluxes in the Russian arctic.  The science plan
              will be presented  at a second workshop in Russia in order to achieve a
              consensus with  Russian scientists on the research priorities that may be
              achieved  in a collaborative, international research program.  The 
              collaborative research program resulting from these workshops will  facilitate
              access for U.S. scientists to a vast part of the  circumarctic that has
              previously been inaccessible to western  researchers studying global change
              processes.
