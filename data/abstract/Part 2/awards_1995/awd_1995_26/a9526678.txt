Abstract    :
              9526678  Tajima     This research is to investigate the seismic structure of the
              upper mantle transition zone, from 400 to 700 km depth, which is key to
              understanding the mode of convection within the Earth's mantle as well as the
              chemical composition of the Earth.  In this project, the plan will be to
              delineate seismic structure of the transition zone associated with Japanese
              subduction zones using upper mantle (triplicated P and S waveforms recorded at
              regional stations.  Three major issues debated recently will be considered: 1)
              what velocity anomalies are associated with the subduction zones in the
              transition zone; 2) whether the subducting slabs flatten at the bottom of the
              transition zone or extend into the lower mantle; and 3) whether the seismic
              structure derived for the upper mantle supports a model of chemical layering or
              one with discontinuities due to temperature-dependent phase transitions
              approximately at 410 km, and possibly at about 525 km.   ***  ??
