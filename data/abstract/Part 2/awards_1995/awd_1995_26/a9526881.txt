Abstract    :
              9526881  Davis    The purpose of the proposed research is  to determine the
              nature and cause of spatial variability of 36Cl in water which has entered the
              subsurface between 50 and 10,000 years ago.  Information concerning geographic
              variations is necessary for interpretation of hydrologic studies of
              ground-water recharge in arid regions, of accumulation rates of glacial ice, of
              ground-water "age", of the origin of chloride in saline lakes, of the origin of
              deep subsurface brines in crystalline rocks, and of other studies related
              directly and indirectly to the field of hydrology.  In addition to providing
              critical baseline information for other projects, the proposed research will
              include sampling of water older than 10,000 years in a few carefully selected
              aquifers to study changes in past rates of natural atmospheric production of
              36Cl.  Primary data for the proposed research will be obtained from analyses of
              ground water from various parts of the United States and from adjacent areas in
              Canada and Mexico.  Samples will be analyzed for major ions using
              chromatography and for 36/Cl/Cl using accelerator mass spectrometry.  In
              addition, analyses for tritium and 14C will be made to help determine isolation
              time of ground waters.  In arid western North America, where suitable water
              samples may not be available, supplemental information may be obtained from
              36Cl extracted from below the depth of penetration of the weapons fallout in
              the soil profile.  Additionally, one or more samples will be obtained from
              glacial ice from mountains in western North America.
