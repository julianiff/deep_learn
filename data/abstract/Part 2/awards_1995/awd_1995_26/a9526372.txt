Abstract    :
              9526372  Nolet      This research is to continue a fundamental research program
              in seismic tomography concentrated mainly in the upper mantle of North America.
               Special emphasis will be on features visible in prior work such as a deep
              plume beneath Yellowstone, remnants of the Farallon plate in the upper mantle,
              and a 250 km deep root under the Canadian shield.  Local surface waves will be
              used to constrain the depth of the Moho discontinuity and teleseismic travel
              time data will be analyzed with waveform inversions and 3D wave bending
              algorithms.  Further applications will be developed to extend the methods to
              higher frequencies, giving higher resolution in regions of large lateral
              heterogeneity.  Deep dehydration models will be tested by application of the
              tomographic methods to the Indonesia/Philippine subduction area.  ***  ??
