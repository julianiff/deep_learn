              Umhoefer  The eastern margin of Baja California is an example of a continental
              margin that has experienced young (Plio-Quaternary) oblique rifting which
              appears to have overprinted, slightly order orthogonal rifting.  This style of
              deformation may lead to formation of detached continental blocks that then
              travel parallel to the margin, eventually becoming  allochthonous terranes 
              attached or reattached to continental margins far from their point of origin. 
              The goals of this collaborative project to test the hypothesis that orthogonal
              rifting was overprinted by oblique rifting, to document fault interactions, to
              investigate segmentation of structures along the margin and to study the
              associated land forms produced by these tectonic events.  Results should help
              understand the origin of the  Gulf of California and, by analogy, may help
              understand allochthonous terranes.                                         Oh
