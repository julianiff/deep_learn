Abstract    :
              9526814  Rundle     This research is to study the non-linear physical properties
              of earthquake occurrence.  A variety of recent as well as older observations
              indicate that clustering in space and time is a fundamental property of
              seismicity observations.  Because forecasting of earthquakes has been based on
              temporal regularity (for example, seismic gaps), the nature of the space-time
              clustering of earthquakes must be understood before any meaningful forecasts
              can be made.  Earthquake clustering is due to non-linear effects and
              interactions between fault segments, and these factors must be understood. 
              This work will test a variety of nonlinear models and simulations that are
              known to produce clustering in space and time through comparison with actual
              seismic data.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.    ***  ??
