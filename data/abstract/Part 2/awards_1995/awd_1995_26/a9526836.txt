Abstract    :
              9526836  Wolfenstine    An  exploratory research program is proposed to 
              investigate  the  possibility of using the unprecedented method of  ingot 
              processing   (thermomechanical  working   of   the   as-cast  material) as an
              alternative to the more conventional  powder  processing     route     for   
              achieving     fine-structure  superplasticity in two-phase structural ceramics
              which  will  eliminate  the problems generally occur in the  conventional 
              powder  processing route; these include (I) the consolidated  powders  do  not
              always attain full density and (ii)  during  processing  the powders impurities
              and unwanted  phases  are  unavoidable.  Magnesium alumnate and magnesium oxide
               system  will   be   attempts  to  prepare  superplastic  two   phase 
              structural   ceramics.   Research,   if   successful,   will  demonstrate  the 
              first time such superplastic  concepts  in  ceramics.  %%%  The goal of this
              research is to explore the unprecedented  method of ingot processing for
              achieving fine structure  superplasticity in two phase structural ceramics.
