Abstract    :
                      9526367  Huband  The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE),
              its Deans  Council, and the American Association of Engineering Societies 
              (AAES) seek to contribute to defining the future of engineering  education and
              practice by convening an International Congress  which will address the
              relevant major issues in the context of a  changed world where globalization of
              engineering is rapidly  occurring, and where information technology has changed
              the  education and practice of engineering.  This International  Congress to be
              held in Washington, DC in June 1996 will examine  engineering education in the
              global context, will serve as a  unique forum for cross cultural information
              sharing, and will  foster a spirit of international cooperation among the
              world's  engineers, engineering educators, and scientists.  ***
