Abstract    :
              9526803  Glazner   The Independence Dike Swarm is an important marker feature in
              California that crosses several important lithospheric and structural
              boundaries.  Until recently its age was accepted as latest Jurassic, however
              many of the dikes have been shown to be cretaceous, and thus were emplaced 
              during sinistral shear deformation in the Sierra Nevada rather than prior to
              that deformation.  This project will address the ages of  the dikes in the
              swarm and attempt to understand the kinematic role they played in the
              synchronous deformation event.  Results should help clarify the age and
              tectonic conditions of their origins, thus improving their utility as regional
              markers.
