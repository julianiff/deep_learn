Abstract    :
              This project will address the physical processes responsible for  the heating
              and wind acceleration in solar coronal holes.  To  determine which mechanism is
              dominant in supplying the wave energy  to solar coronal holes, the PI will
              calculate the efficiency of  generation of Alfven tube waves by large amplitude
              acoustic waves  existing near the top of the solar convective zone.  The
              calculated  wave energy fluxes will then be compared to those obtained earlier,
               and to the total heat input required by observations.  These  studies will be
              important to understanding the principal energy  sources for solar coronal
              holes and the basic physical processes  responsible for creating the
              heliosphere.***
