Abstract    :
              9526394  Hammond  This project will attempt the design and synthesis of 
              thermoplastic liquid crystalline elastomers (LCTPE's) which  can be processed
              using traditional plastics processing  techniques.  These polymer systems
              consist of block or  segmented copolymers in which hard or rigid blocks
              alternate  with flexible side chain liquid crystalline polymer.  The 
              reversibility of the thermoplastic "crosslink" with  temperature will provide
              new routes to the formation of  highly anisotropic elastomeric systems through
              orientation  induced during plastic processing.  A new level of control  in the
              supramolecular ordering can be achieved with these  systems that is not
              accessible with crosslinked liquid  crystalline elastomers; the degree and type
              of orientation  in an LCTPE sample may be altered simply by changing 
              thermoplastic processing parameters.  The resulting  elastomeric materials are
              expected to exhibit enhanced  mechano- and electro-optic properties.  The 
              synthesis of  LCTPE's will further our understanding of liquid crystalline 
              behavior in two phase polymer systems, particularly,  elastomeric two phase
              systems.  The effects of domain  interfaces on nematic, smectic and chiral
              smectic phases  will be examined, as well as the effect of domain  confinement
              on liquid crystalline electro-optic and mechano-  optic behavior.  %%%  It is
              hoped that this work will form the basis of a new area  of research in the
              coupling of liquid crystalline behavior  with the supramolecular structures
              possible from two-phase  polymer morphologies and the added control and
              orientation  gained from thermoplastic processing.  ***
