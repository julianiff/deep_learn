Abstract    :
              9526274  Sankey  This is a new grant supporting work in a new area for the 
              Materials Theory program.  The initial objective is to study  the electronic
              properties of  porous materials such as  zeolites and silica and the closely
              related clathrates and  clathrasils.  The ground state electronic energy 
              calculations are carried out in an accurate, first  principles, selfconsistent
              way developed by the PI and along  with quantum molecular dynamics
              capabilities, allow  determination of structural and dynamic properties of 
              various possible cage-like structures.  New applications  will also be
              explored.  These include self-assembled-caged  semiconductor clusters and
              wires.  These artificially  created quantum dots and wires may have "tunable"
              bandgaps  and lattice spacings, depending on the zeolite framework (or 
              clathrates) and choice of semiconductor compound.  %%%  Zeolites and related
              silica are used commonly in petroleum  and drug industries.  Structurally they
              consist of cages  connected by channels and they are used mainly to exchange 
              or "crack" foreign atoms and molecules within these channels  or cages. This
              grant is to conduct theoretical research for  a better understanding of the
              zeolites and similar clathrate  compounds (have cages but no channels) and
              their  applications.  The principal method of study is a formalism  developed
              earlier by the PI.  ***
