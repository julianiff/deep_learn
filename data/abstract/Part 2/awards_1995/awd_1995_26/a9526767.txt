Abstract    :
              9526767  Rudnicki    This research is a theoretical examination of the effects
              of coupling of shear deformation with pore fluid pressure changes on the
              stability of slip in fault gouge zones.  Pore pressure alterations arise from
              shear-induced dilatancy or compaction and shear heating.  The model
              incorporates idealizations of material behavior observed in laboratory
              experiments and estimated and measured in situ conditions.  Numerical and
              asymptotic solution of the equations describing the model yield predictions of
              the evolution of fault slip and the temperature and pore pressure in the fault
              zone.  The pressure and temperature changes predicted by the analysis provide a
              basis for the interpretation of hydrothermal mineralization and chemical
              alterations often observed in exhumed fault gouge zones.  This research is a
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***    ??
