Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a project to develop long-term  records of the
              atmospheric deposition of aerosol-borne, marine-  derived elements to the
              Antarctic ice sheet.  The project  includes the sampling of Antarctic ice core
              samples from the  Vostok ice core and the laboratory analysis of soluble ions
              in  the ice.  The analyses include methanesulfonate, non-sea-salt  sulfate, and
              several additional ions derived from gaseous  emissions from the sea surface,
              from seasalt, and associated with  continental dust. The principal emphasis of
              this work is on  sulfur, because of its role as a major aerosol-forming 
              constituent of the atmosphere, and its potential importance to  climate.  The
              main goal of the project is to complete analyses of  the Vostok ice core.
