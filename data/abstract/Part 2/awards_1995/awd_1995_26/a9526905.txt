Abstract    :
              9526905  Wahr      This research is to study the possible effects of upper
              mantle phase transformations, for example at depths of 410 and 660 km, on
              seismic motions, especially the free oscillations of the earth.  Preliminary
              estimates suggest that during seismic motions, material in the vicinity of a
              phase boundary could change phase as it oscillates.  For example, perturbations
              to the eigenfrequencies of free oscillations due to the 660 km boundary could
              be anywhere from a few tenths to several percent, well within the observational
              uncertainties of the eigenfrequencies.  The objectives are to study whether the
              inversion of free oscillation data for spherical structure could provide useful
              information on the 410 and 660 km discontinuities; and to judge whether the
              inclusion of phase transformation effects into the inversion process might
              improve the inversions for other parameters.  For the latter, the work will
              focus especially, though not exclusively, on implications for the density
              profile in the transition zone, and on the bulk dissipation models that have
              been inferred from observations of radial mode  attenuation.  ***  ??
