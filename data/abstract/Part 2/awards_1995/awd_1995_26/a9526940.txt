Abstract    :
              Lund  9526940     This proposal requests funds to recover replicate, detailed
              PSV, excursion, and paleointensity records within oxygen isotope stages 5 and 6
              from a group of 28 piston cores (20 m average length) that has recently been
              recovered from the Blake/Bahama Outer Ridge, a deep-sea sediment drift deposit
              in the Western North Atlantic Ocean (35o N, 72o W).  All of the cored sediments
              are less than 200,000 years old (     18 O Stage 6) and have sedimentation
              rates of at least 10 cm/kyr; most have rates greater than 20 cm/kyr during the
              Pleistocene. The PIs previous paleomagnetic and sediment magnetic studies of
              sediments from the Blake/Bahama Outer Ridge clearly show that paleomagnetic
              field secular variation (PSV) is recorded in these cores, and that the PSV
              records from the different cores can be easily correlated among them.  One of
              the most significant aspects of this previous work is the first complete record
              of the Laschamp excursion (42 ka).  The distinctive vector and paleointensity
              pattern of this excursion record and its self-similarity to the Mono Lake
              excursion (28ka) argue that they were formed by the same style of core dynamo
              process.  Preliminary paleomagnetic data from three of our new cores clearly
              indicate that these records also contain two more excursions:  'Blake event'
              (ca. 125 ka), first defined from sediment cores of the Blake/Bahama Outer Ridge
              (Smith and Foster, 1969), and the Biwa I?  excursion (ca. 170 ka).  Preliminary
              paleomagnetic data indicate that the Blake excursion looks like a true reversed
              polarity interval within the earliest interval of  oxygen isotope stage 5.  On
              the other hand, the Biwa I excursion looks much more like the Mono Lake and
              Laschamp excursions.  The proposed research will provide critical new
              information for developing a new model of the relationship between PSV and
              excursions and will have a broad impact in the paleo-magnetics community.
