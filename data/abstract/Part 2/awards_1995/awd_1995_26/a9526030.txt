              Abstract  ATM-9526030  Webster, Peter J.  University of Colorado  Title: The
              Dynamics of Low-Frequency Phenomena    The PI will investigate and describe:  o
                 The morphology of the monsoon and its relationship with other      
              circulation systems.  This project represents a major new       initiative in
              the study of low frequency phenomena.  o    Wave propagation through the very
              complex background flow of       tropics.  The PI plans to extend earlier work
              and to       investigate the impact of vertical shear on equatorial wave      
              propagation and, finally consider all shears and stretching       deformations
              concurrently.  o    Intraseasonal variability from the perspective of coupled  
                  ocean-atmosphere dynamic systems.  The PI notes that the       location of
              convection in the tropics and its organization on       the intraseasonal time
              scales remains largely unexplained.  He       plans to investigate this
              organization from a fundamental       perspective relative to the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system.  The monsoons and the circulation associated with the
              east-west sea-  surface temperature (SST) gradients produce a slowly evolving 
              system within which resides a large proportion of the interannual  variability
              of the climate system.  The slow migrations of  convection clusters which make
              up the intraseasonal variability in  the tropics may be products of the low
              frequency monsoon-ENSO  system.  To a first approximation, the regions where
              equatorial  transient waves accumulate their energy or where they influence 
              higher latitudes is determined by the slowly evolving state of the 
              monsoon-ENSO system.  The PI proposes a program in which the low  frequency
              monsoon-ENSO systems is defined within the context of  ocean-atmosphere-land
              coupling.    This research is important because it seeks knowledge about the 
              factors that control the seasonal-to-interannual variability of the  climate. 
              Such knowledge is required in order to improve the  prediction of climate
              variability on these time s cales.
