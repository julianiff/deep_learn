Abstract    :
              9526955  Fisher   Subduction of oceanic plates under continental margin commonly
              involves uplift of forearc regions, and recently it has been shown that
              subduction of large features such as seismic ridges causes differential uplift
              in the margin above the down-going buoyant material.  This project will test
              the idea that along sediment starved convergent margins forearc deformation is
              characterized by differential uplift in the upper plate controlled by the
              roughness of the incoming seafloor bathymetry.  This work involves integration
              of structural, bathymetric seismic and geodetic information in the middle
              America trench off Costa Rica to determine the linkage between down-going
              topography and the resulting differential uplift topography of the upper plate,
              and the operative kinematics, stress orientation and seismicity associated with
              the phenomena.  Results will be useful in understanding uplift in active
              forearc regions and is subduction zone dynamic generally.
