Abstract    :
              9526765  Griggs    This grant provides $41,870 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring a Sun SPARC20 workstation,  image processing software and
              peripherals for use  in the study of surficial and tectonic processes  as
              determined from digital analyses of aerial and  satellite photography.  The
              equipment will serve  as a central tool for the PI's research on  regional and
              global shoreline evolution and active  tectonics as well as for the training of
              graduates  students and as a regional facility for  quantitative geomorphology.
