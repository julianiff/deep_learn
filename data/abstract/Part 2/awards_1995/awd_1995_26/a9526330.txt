Abstract    :
              9526330  Li, Y-G    This research is to investigate the fine structure and
              physical properties of the fault zone ruptured in the January 17, 1995, M=6.9
              Kobe, Japan, earthquake in 3-D using fault zone trapped waves.  A similar
              successful fault zone study was done for the 1992 M=7.6 Landers, California,
              earthquake rupture.  Sixty portable seismic instruments from the IRIS PASSCAL
              pool will be deployed across the Kobe rupture zone.  Japan colleagues will
              deploy their own instruments in a cooperative effort.  The data will be
              interpreted using 3-D finite-difference and 3-D boundary-element simulations
              with comparison between the Kobe and Landers earthquake results.  This research
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
