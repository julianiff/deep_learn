Abstract    :
              9526809  Haldar  A comprehensive study will be  conducted on the inelastic
              seismic  response behavior of steel frames  with partially restrained (PR) 
              connections considering all major  sources of energy dissipation.  The 
              procedure considers as  realistically as possible the  geometric nonlinearity
              including  the P-delta effect due to drift in  the presence of  PR connections,
               material  nonlinearity, loading and  reloading behavior at the PR 
              connections, and damping.  Uncertainty in the parameters will  be considered
              using a nonlinear  stochastic finite element  algorithm.  Reliability analysis 
              will be conducted to generalize the  observations made during the  experiments
              and deterministic  analyses, and for codification of  design.  Serviceability 
              requirements consistent with the  strength requirements will then be 
              formulated.  Several definitions of  local, interstory and global  ductility
              will be investigated,  particularly for the multiple  degree of freedom
              structures, and  the most appropriate definition  will be identified.  Commonly
              used  steel frames including moment-  residing frames, braced frames,  dual
              systems with concentric and  eccentric braces will be  investigated.  Design
              factors will  be re-evaluated and introduced for  the seismic design of steel
              frames  with PR connections.    The study will complement SAC's  Phase II study
              on seismic analysis  of steel framed structures which is  funded by FEMA.  The
              project will  involve industry trade and  associations such as the American 
              Institute of Steel Construction  (AISC) and the American Iron and  Steel
              Institute (AISI).  ***
