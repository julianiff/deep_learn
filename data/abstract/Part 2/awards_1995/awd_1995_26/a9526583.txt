Abstract    :
                 9526583 Aziz   This research aims, through the study of unique aspects of
              solid phase epitaxy of silicon, to explore the basic mechanism and kinetics of
              interfacial roughening commonly encountered during epitaxy of  SiGe alloys, and
              during heteroepitaxy of compound semiconductor materials.  Critical parameters
              of particular relevance to kinetic phenomena, the spacing(wavelength),
              amplitude and stress dependence of this interfacial instability will be
              determined.  Additionally, computer simulation and modeling will be utilized as
              an integral part of the research to better analyze experimental results and
              gain further understanding and insight into the mechanistic details of
              interfacial roughening. %%%  This project will explore a new and innovative
              approach achieve better fundamental understanding of kinetic phenomena of
              critical importance to the synthesis and processing of advanced electronic and
              photonic materials.  The proposed research has potential for high pay-off to a
              broad range of experimental and theoretical data accumulated to date, and
              several key issues can be appropriately addressed and resolved by the project
              to provide greater understanding and insight to atomic level processes of
              significance to advancing the field of microelectronics. Additionally, an
              important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
