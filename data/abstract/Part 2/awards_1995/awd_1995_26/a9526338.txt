Abstract    :
              9526338  Lange         This grant awards $16,610 as one-half of the costs  of
              acquiring equipment necessary to construct a  rapid-quench, cold-seal pressure
              apparatus for  experimental petrological research to be conducted  at the
              University of Michigan.  Specifically, the  system will be used to synthesize
              volatile-bearing  silicate liquids at low pressures (<300 MPa).  These samples
              will then be used for low-  temperature (<1000 degrees C) measurements of 
              density, thermal expansion, viscosity, and heat  capacity.  In situ density
              (sink/float) and  viscosity (falling sphere) experiments will also  be
              conducted using volatile-bearing silicate  liquids.  These experiments will
              allow precise  determination of the partial molar volume of water  and other
              volatiles in silicate melts.  ***
