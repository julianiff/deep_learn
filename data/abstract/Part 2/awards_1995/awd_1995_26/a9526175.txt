Abstract    :
              9526175  Hall  This  research  involves a continuation of the  wide-ranging 
              study  of  the  reactions  of  electron-rich  olefins   with  electron-poor 
              olefins to form a variety of small  molecules  and   polymers  by 
              "charge-transfer  polymerization."   The  fundamentals  of  these processes are
              being  worked  out  by  variations in monomer structure, solvent, concentration
               and  temperature.  In addition to these parameters, the effect of  the 
              complexation  of the electron-poor monomer  with  Lewis  acids  will  be
              studied in each system.  A wide  variety  of  industrially important monomers
              will be examined  from  this  point of view.  %%%  This  research  aims  to
              simplify and  control  thermal  and  direct  photochemical polymerizations in
              order  to  optimize  polymerization   processes  and  polymer  properties.   
              The  importance   of   this  research  lies  in  both   expanding  fundamental 
               information  of  thermal   and   photochemical  cycloadditions  and
              polymerizations as well  as  in  various  practical aspects.  ***
