              Stock  The PIs have received approval from the Geological Society of America
              (GSA) to hold a Penrose conference of   The Tectonic Evolution of  the Gulf of
              California and Its Margins  during April, 1996.  They plan to involve about
              60-70 investigators (including graduate students) from the US, Mexico, and
              other nations on discussing specifics of the evolution of the rift system and
              comparison to other rift systems of the world.  This should allow them assess
              the state of knowledge of the Gulf of California, and to identify important
              problems for future work in the region, both onshore and in the Gulf of
              California.  There are three major scientific reasons why a Penrose conference
              on this topic is extremely timely.  (1) A re-evaluation of the post-25 Ma
              evolution of the San Andreas fault system has occurred in recent years.  This
              is directly relevant to development of the Gulf of California because the San
              Andreas fault system is the northern continuation of the Gulf of California
              because the San Andreas fault system is the northern continuation of the Gulf 
              of California transform-rift syst em.  (2) More detailed and better constrained
              models of the evolution of the Pacific-North America plate boundary have
              improved correlations between tectonic events in the Gulf region and changes in
              relative plate motion.  (3) A series of analytical and experimental models of
              the structural evolution of oblique-rift plate margins have been published in
              the past few years, but these generally lack thorough testing by field studies.
               The margins of the Gulf of California are an ideal place to conduct such
              research.  Support is provided Earth Sciences (Tectonics) and Ocean Sciences
