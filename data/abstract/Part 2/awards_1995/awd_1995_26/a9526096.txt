Abstract    :
              9526096  Gordon    This award supports a two-year cooperative research program 
              between Prof. Robert J. Gordon at the University of Illinois  at Chicago and
              Prof. Yutaka Matsumi at Hokkaido University  in Japan. Their shared research
              interests include the  spectroscopy and reaction dynamics of gas phase
              molecules.  The goal of our joint research effort is to use digital  imaging
              techniques to study the photodissociation of  molecules.  They plan to use this
              technology to gain deeper  insight into the interaction of light with matter
              and to  explore the possibility of using lasers to control chemical  reactions.
                 Members of the two research groups will visit each other's  laboratories in
              order to perform experiments and to analyze  the resulting data.  Previously,
              several members of Prof.  Matsumi's group have spent extensive visits in Prof. 
              Gordon's laboratory. This new grant will enable Prof. Gordon  to visit Hokkaido
              with an American graduate student to use  Prof. Matsumi's ion imaging
              apparatus, with the eventual  goal of constructing a similar machine in
              Chicago.  This  international collaboration will thereby facilitate the 
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge.  ***
