Abstract    :
              Hawkins  the proposed research will quantify the initial response of steam biota
              to catastrophic flooding in several mountainous streams of California.  Our
              primary hypothesis is that the magnitude of effect that flooding has on biota
              is influenced by both naturally occurring differences among watersheds in their
              sensitivity to flooding and the amount of land use that has occurred within
              each watershed.  To test this hypothesis, will resample streams in up to 45
              watersheds that were previously sampled during the drought years of 1988 and
              1989 and compare pre- and post-flood abundances and species occurrence in each
              watershed.
