Abstract    :
              9526241  Rhodes       A three-year is proposed for the collection and study of 
              rocks from the southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii.  Many rocks
              from this area are picrites and it is possible that  the deep eruptions are a
              result of density filtering of the  magmas due to pooling of dense magmas deep
              within the conduit  system.  The alternative is that the lavas exposed on the 
              proposed slump surface are older than subaerial lavas and  therefore show a
              temporal variation of chemistry of lavas.  These  lavas are particularly
              interesting because they are the most Mg-  rich lavas ever found on Hawaii or
              other similar island and these  glasses can tell us much about how the mantle
              melts and how the  melts are transported to the surface.  ***
