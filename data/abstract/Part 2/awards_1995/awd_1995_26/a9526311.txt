Abstract    :
              95-26311  A'Hearn  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
              Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. A'Hearn will reduce and
              analyze numerous data sets obtained of the event.  The data sets include
              observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, near-infrared imaging with the
              Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, HI, optical imaging from Cerro
              Tololo, South America, and Kitt Peak, AZ, optical imaging and high-speed
              photometry from Australian observatories, and several other observations.    In
              reducing and analyzing the data, particular attention will be paid to improving
              the signal-to-noise ratio, since most data are severely limited by the sky
              background or by scattered light.  Furthermore, all data will be prepared for
              public archiving.    Scientific topics that will be paid attention to include
              flashes due to the impacts, properties of the comet, and effects of the impact
              on Jovian clouds.  **
