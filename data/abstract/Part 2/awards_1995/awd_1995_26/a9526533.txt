Abstract    :
              Tauxe  9526533   The PI's propose to continue their investigations into the
              origin of magnetite and magnetic remanence in submarine basaltic glass and to
              acquire paleointensity data for a globally distributed database throughout the
              Cenozoic.  They will carry out rock magnetic studies and laboratory synthesis
              of basaltic glasses in order to further understanding of the origin of the
              magnetite that carries the magnetic remanence in submarine basaltic glass. 
              This research has far-reaching consequences for understanding the nature of the
              earth's core and generation of the geodynamo, and for reconstructing earth's
              geomagnetic field history.
