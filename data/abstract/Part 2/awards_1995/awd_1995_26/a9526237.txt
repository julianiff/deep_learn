Abstract    :
              Jiri Jonas is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in experimental studies of the  
              dynamic structure of liquids using NMR and laser Raman spectroscopy.  The  
              major thrust of the research is to study liquids at high pressures and in  
              confined regions.  High resolution NMR of liquids under high pressures is  
              being used to separate the effects of density and temperature on   dynamical
              processes such as self-diffusion and shear viscosities.  Recent   work on the
              preparation of porous silica glasses by sol-gel processes   have led to studies
              of both NMR and Raman spectra of liquids confined in   glasses with well
              defined pore sizes from 10 A to 200 A.  The main   research directions to be
              explored include: 1) NMR studies of the   applicability of the hydrodynamic
              Stokes-Einstein and Debye equations at   the molecular level in liquids near
              their glass transition temperature;   2) NMR experiments dealing with
              confinement effects on angular momentum   behavior in liquids; 3) NMR study of
              conformational isomerization in   confined liquids; 4) Raman studies of
              confinement effects on vibrational   and reorientational relaxation in liquids;
              and 5) NMR study of the   pressure effects on hydrogen exchange in aqueous
              solutions of amides and   polyamides.  New information on liquids at the atomic
              and molecular level obtained   through NMR studies of liquids at high pressure
              will help in   understanding the function of lubricants.  The studies of
              liquids in   confined geometries has technological applications in many fields 
               including catalysis, chromatography, membrane separations, and liquid  
              permeability in geological formations.
