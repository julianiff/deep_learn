              Bodnar  Results of two pilot studies offer encouragement that fluid inclusion
              reequilibration behavior is NOT a random process but, rather occurs
              systematically and reflects the changing physical and chemical environment of 
              the inclusions.  As such, fluid inclusion reequilibration characteristics may
              supplement other techniques used to infer P-T histories of samples which have
              experienced complex tectonic histories.  The present project will continue and
              expand pilot studies to compare laboratory-reequilibrated samples with natural
              samples from well-characterized environments.  The work will include more
              detailed study of samples from the two pilot studies as well as samples
              representing other P-T-paths.  The effects of time, fluid composition, loading
              rates, inclusion size, shape, etc.  on the reequilibration process will be
              examined in a systematic manner to develop a predictive tool that may be used
              to complement other commonly used techniques.                          ;
