Abstract    :
              9526102  Kiremidjian  The rapid assessment of the state  of critical and
              conventional civil  infrastructures, in normal  operation as well as in natural
               hazard conditions is essential.  In  this project an intelligent system  will
              be developed for monitoring  the state of structures that  utilizes advanced
              sensing,  microprocessing, wireless  transmission, and damage diagnostic 
              methods.  The monitoring system  will evaluate the global damage  level as well
              as the specific  location, type, and degree of local  damage to structural
              elements and  connections.  The system will be  designed to periodically test
              and  assess the condition of a structure  under normal operating conditions; 
              and will evaluate its state  following extreme loads such as  those caused by
              hurricanes,  earthquakes, or blasts.  Application of the monitoring  system
              with wireless communications  capabilities to both existing and  newly built
              structures will be  investigated.    The research effort will focus  primarily
              on the design and  development of the distributed  sensor  units, site master 
              processor, and the efficient  wireless communication system ofthe  damage
              monitoring system.  Combinations of sensors will be  utilized to enable
              assessment of  the overall damage state of the  structure and to identify
              specific  locations and types of  deterioration.  Advanced  computational
              algorithms will be  developed to enable efficient and  reliable estimation of
              the state of  the structure.  ***
