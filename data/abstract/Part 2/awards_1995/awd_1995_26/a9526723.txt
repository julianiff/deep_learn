Abstract    :
              9526723  Hanan  The object of this proposal is to investigate connections
              between the dynamics of mantle plumes and continental basalts.  The proposed
              connection between mantle plumes, flood basalts, and intraplate seamount chains
              implies that volcanic rocks which form by passage of  lithosphere over a mantle
              plume will display chemical and isotopic compositions which vary in response to
              plume dynamics and interactions between the plume and the overlying
              lithosphere.  The P.I.s propose to investigate this process by examining
              spatial and temporal variations in the chemistry of basaltic lavas found in the
              Snake River Plain along a transect between Mountain Home and Twin Falls, Idaho.
               Selected samples from each will be analyzed for major and trace element
              geochemistry by XRF spectrometry (USC); a representative subset of these will
              be chosen for analysis of additional trace elements ICP-MS (Centenary),and
              radiogenic isotopes (SDSU).  The P.I.s plan to date 14 lava flows using
              39Ar/40Ar (Berkeley Geochronology Laboratory).  These data will allow us to
              assess changes in the mantle source regions of the basalts, and to identify the
              effects of lithospheric and crustal assimilation.
