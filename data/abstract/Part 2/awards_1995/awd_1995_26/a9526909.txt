Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology   using
              amino acids as starting materials for the synthesis of cell-surface  
              carbohydrates, and the mechanism-based inhibitors of carbohydrate   processing
              enzymes.  Targets include aza-sugars, indolizidine and   pyrrolizidine
              alkaloids.  Current methods will be extended to produce   fucolipid
              biosynthesis inhibitors and complex alkaloids such as   lycoricidine.  Also, 
              Schiff bases will be used to produce   aza-C-glycoside, UDP-galactose and
              GDP-fucose analogs to serve as   glycosyltransferase inhibitors.  Schiff bases
              will also be used to   synthesize optically pure C2-symmetric chiral ligands,
              ligands that have   potential for use in asymmetric, metal catalyzed
              epoxidations.  With this   renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research   of Dr. Robin L. Polt of the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of   Arizona.   Professor Polt will focus his research on the
              synthesis of    glycosidase and glycotransferase inhibitors.   These inhibitors
              are   important for the study of the biosynthesis of cell-surface
              carbohydrates.
