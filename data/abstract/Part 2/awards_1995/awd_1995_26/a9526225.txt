Abstract    :
              9526225    It is Proposed to use interfacial dynamics, a specific implementation
              of the boundary-integral method, and statistical mechanics to simulate
              non-dilute deferrable suspension flow, and on this basis evaluate the effective
              rheological and transport properties of suspensions.  Three-dimensional
              numerical studies will be performed using local analytical solutions and code
              vectorization at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  The resulted code is
              applicable to a large range of dispersed two-phase flow phenomena, and is
              computer time-efficient.    The research will provide better understanding and
              a numerical tool for suspension flow simulations useful in biotechnology,
              chemical and petroleum industries.
