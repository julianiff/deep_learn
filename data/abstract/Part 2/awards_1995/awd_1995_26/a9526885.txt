Abstract    :
              9526885  Davis      The PIs propose to constrain mantle viscosity and ice
              history from  data obtained from project BIFROST (Baseline Inferences of 
              Fennoscandian Rebound Observations, Sea Level and Tectonics).  GPS 
              measurements from several permanent networks will be used to  determine the
              three dimensional site velocity to constrain models  for mantle viscosity and
              ice history.  Inverse modeling methods  will be used to map out allowed
              combinations of ice and earth  models.  ***
