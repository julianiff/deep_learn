              CTS - 9526328   Nair Rodriquez-Hornedo  University of Michigan    ABSTRACT    
              The project aims at understanding the molecular processes that control
              crystallization during dissolution of metastable solid phases in the presence
              of surfactants.  The objectives include identifying the role of metastable
              solid phases on the nucleation of stable molecular crystals and explaining the
              effects of surfactant association on nucleation mechanism and crystal
              morphology.  Experiments will be performed using dihydrate carbamazepine as a
              model drug and two types of surfactant, aliphatic long-chain surfactants and
              bile salts.  Molecular modeling will be used to study the role of
              crystallographic parameters and molecular structure of dominant crystal faces. 
              The key question is whether nucleation of the stable crystalline phase is
              enhanced by crystal surfaces of the dissolving metastable phase.  If nucleation
              occurs at very low supersaturations, the drug concentration in solution may
              never reach the desired levels.  The results on the effects of surfactants on
              nucleation and crystallization will be particularly useful to the
              pharmaceutical industry and may also have an impact on the manufacturing of
              specialty chemicals.
