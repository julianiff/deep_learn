Abstract    :
              9526269  Patchett    This grant provide partial support of the costs of 
              acquiring a new thermal ionization mass  spectrometer (TIMS) with multiple
              collectors and  ion counting capabilities which will used for  isotopic
              research at the University of Arizona's  Department of Geosciences. 
              Specifically, the new  TIMS will complement an existing VG-354 TIMS  purchased
              entirely with University of Arizona  funds in 1983 that is presently
              oversubscribed and  is beginning to show degradation, particularly  with regard
              to measurements of Strontium isotope  ratios.  Thus the older TIMS will be used
               primarily for analyses of U-Pb, Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd  isotopes in studies of
              tectonics and crustal  genesis while the new TIMS would be largely used  for
              research utilizing Sr isotopes in studies of  Himalayan tectonics and the use
              of 87Sr/86Sr in  lacustrine carbonates as a proxy for paleolake  levels.  ***
