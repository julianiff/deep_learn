Abstract    :
              9526007    Phillips     The goal of this research is to develop cost models that
              can be used in both commercial and defense manufacturing activities to assess
              and evaluate the cost impact of technological innovation and/or design changes
              on the product life cycle.  The cost of design, process modification, quality,
              maintainability, and disposal are included in this concept.  A standard set of
              topological cost models for cost-driver activities will be derived accessing a
              set of relational data base files containing time, cost, and resource
              requirements.  Utilizing the principles of activity based costing and a
              knowledge base including all cross-impact and linking cost relationships, a
              life cycle cost for technological innovation and design changes for both
              "as-is" and "to-be" scenarios will be calculated.  Risk analysis, sensitivity
              analysis of key cost drivers, and the cost of quality will be included.  Three
              industrial partners will collaborate in this research.        This research may
              effect a uniform life cycle cost model using a realistic and acceptable
              allocation of both direct and indirect costs and component models with
              standardized topology.  The results would provoke a dramatic improvement in the
              ability of manufacturing firms to estimate the cost of design changes and
              technological innovation.
