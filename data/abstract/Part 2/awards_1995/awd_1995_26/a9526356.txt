Abstract    :
                9526356  Altabet  The authors propose to explore the potential of stable
              nitrogen  isotopes in marine sediments as tracers of past nitrate  utilization,
              and hence of primary production.  They will examine  the difference between
              water-column and surface sediment ratios,  explore the feasibility of analyzing
              organic material in the  matrices of individual microfossils, and will examine
              a typical  sediment record from the equatorial Pacific to determine whether 
              the changes seen from glacial to interglacial periods might be only  an
              artifact of differential preservation.
