Abstract    :
              9526510   Wine   This project addresses the subject of sources and sinks of
              atmospheric nitrous oxide. This species is the dominant source of
              ozone-destroying nitric oxide radicals in the stratosphere. Furthermore, it is
              a greenhouse gas, and its concentration has been increasing. The current belief
              is that nitrous oxide has no natural sources other than microbiological
              activity in the ground and oceans, and its destruction is solely by
              photodissociation and reaction with excited atomic oxygen in the upper
              atmosphere. However, current estimates of sources and sinks suggest the
              existence of a currently unrecognized source. Furthermore, recent measurements
              of the isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrous oxide cannot be explained by
              accepted sources.    Laboratory experiments will be performed in this project
              to investigate the potential formation of nitrous oxide from the reactions of
              electronically excited nitrogen dioxide and hydroxyl radicals with molecular
              nitrogen in the presence of oxygen. Chemical kinetics modeling studies will
              investigate why nitrous oxide is efficiently formed upon UV illumination of a
              nitrogen/oxygen mixture without ozone added, but not in a mixture of all three.
              These calculations will provide guidance for future experimental investigation
              of the issue of nitrous oxide production and destruction.   ***
