Abstract    :
              9526787  Hager    This project involves a multi-disciplinary investigation of
              the  deep structure and kinematics of deformation of the Tien Shan, the 
              largest and most active intracontinental mountain range in the  world.  The
              objective is to understand the dynamic processes  responsible for
              intracontinental mountain building, using the Tien  Shan as a laboratory to
              ask:  Why and how such deformation occurs  where it does within continental
              regions, how such deformation  evolves with time, what bounds does the deep
              structure place on  flow in the mantle, and how do such possible flow and
              pre-existing  geological heterogeneity relate to the observed deformation of
              the  upper crust?    This award provides a modest amount of funding for
              scientific and  logistical planning to develop a phased approach and sound 
              management plan for this complicated project.  ***
