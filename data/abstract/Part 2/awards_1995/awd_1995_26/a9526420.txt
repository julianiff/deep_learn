Abstract    :
              This award is for support for the measurement of electrical and  optical
              properties of the Siple Dome ice core.  The electrical  methods can be used to
              determine the concentration of the  hydrogen ions and the concentration of a
              weighted sum of all  ions.  The electrical measurements can resolve features as
              small  as 1 cm.  The albedo of the core is also measured with a laser  system
              that can resolve features as small as 0.5 cm.  The high  spatial resolution of
              these methods makes them ideal for  resolving narrow features in the core,
              which can be missed in  larger composite samples.  The measurements will be
              particularly  useful for assisting to date the core and to identify short 
              duration features in the record, such as volcanic eruptions.  These
              measurements will also provide useful information for  assessing the temporal
              variability of Holocene accumulation rate  and atmospheric circulation.
