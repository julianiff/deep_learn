Abstract    :
              9526972  Richards        The PI proposes to develop global mantle convection
              models that are  directly constrained by the history of plate motions and by 
              knowledge of present-day mantle heterogeneity.  The focus will be  on
              elucidating the large-scale dynamics and evolution of mantle  convection and
              plate tectonics during the past 100-200 million  years for which reasonable
              well-constrained plate motion  reconstructions are available.  Models will be
              constrained by  seismic tomography and plate motion reconstructions, and by 
              comparing their predictions with geological and geophysical  observations such
              as intraplate stresses and deformation, plate  boundary interactions, dynamic
              topography (sealevel) variations,  and true polar wandering.  ***
