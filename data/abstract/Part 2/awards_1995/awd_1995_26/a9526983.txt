              Fletcher  Determination and qualification of the micromechanics of faulting is
              an important problem, both in addressing events prior to and during
              earthquakes, and in interpreting observations from experiments and from the
              field.  The role of mode I opening cracks has always been a basic element in
              the formulation of the micromechanics of faulting.  Recently, a model for the
              organization of the fault of fault zone resulting in a deep focus earthquake
              has been based upon the interaction and propagation of mode I closing
              anticracks (Green and Burnley, 1989; Green, 1994, 1995), the anticracks being
              thin laminae of the higher-density spinel formed in the olivine-> spinel phase
              transformation.  Fault zones which arise from the organized interaction of
              cracks and anticracks are observed in the deformed limestones of the central
              Appalachians, and analogous structures have been reported from other settings. 
              In these occurrences, the cracks are represented by veins, and the anticracks
              by solution seams.  In view of the role of pressure solution, the process of
              formation of these structures is slow,  but the weakened zone might eventually
              fail by rapid, seismic faulting.  These structures are also significant in
              their own tectonic setting, besides illustrating a process of potentially
              broader scope.  The aim of the proposed research is to study these structures
              through detailed observation, at field mapping to thin-section scale, and to
              develop mechanical models for their initiation and evolution, at
              micromechanical and macroscopic levels.                          ;
