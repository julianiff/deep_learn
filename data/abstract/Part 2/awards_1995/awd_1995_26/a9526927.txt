Abstract    :
              9526927  Bukowinski  This project will develop a self consistent set of ab
              initio models for the response of deformable ions to crystal environments using
              density functional theory.  The models will be used to examine the static and
              dynamic properties of transition zone and lmwer mantle minerals composed of
              SiO2, MgO, FeO, CaO and Al2O3, including perovskites, MgSiO3 Majorite, and
              other garnets and phases containing tetrahedral coordination polyhedra. Monte
              Carlo, molecular dynamics, simulated annealing techniques will be used to
              explore mineral structures at intermediate to very high pressures and
              temperatures, and to estimate thermal parameters needed to model mineral
              assemblages that may account for the observed seismic properties of the mantle.
               This will lead to a better understanding of possible sources of radial
              discontinuities deep in the lower mantle, and of thermal, structural and
              chemical effects on seismic velocities and the geochemical evolution of the
              earth.
