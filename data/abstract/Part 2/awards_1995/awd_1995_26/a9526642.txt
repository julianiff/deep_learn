Abstract    :
              9526642  Campbell  The goal of this proposal is to re-evaluate the potential of
              fluid inclusion dating by building upon the knowledge from previous attempts
              and applying a refined experimental 40Ar/39Ar technique to ideally-suited
              samples obtained from the mineralized zones within the Capitan pluton, central
              New Mexico.  This project will advance 40Ar/39Ar technique towards a wider
              applicability to dating ore deposits in general and enhance the fundamental
              understanding of the role fluid inclusions play in the general application of
              argon geochronology.
