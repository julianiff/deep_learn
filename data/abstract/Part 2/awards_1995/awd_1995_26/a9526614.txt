Abstract    :
              9526614  Kent    The PIs propose to test the fundamental configuration of Pangea
              in  the late Triassic by obtaining a sequence of paleomagnetic pole  positions
              registered to a magnetic polarity stratigraphy from the  thick Triassic section
              in the Argana rift basin of Morocco.  These  data will be compared to the
              cyclostratigraphically calibrated  sequence of geomagnetic reversals and
              paleopoles that they have  recently obtained for about 30 my of the Late
              Triassic and earliest  Jurassic from scientific drilling in the Newark rift
              basin of  eastern North America and the two sets of data will be used to 
              discriminate between the main classes of Pangea models.  ***
