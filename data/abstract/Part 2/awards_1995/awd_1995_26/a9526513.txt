Abstract    :
              This grant supports a mathematical research institute during the  summer of
              1996.  This institute will be the forty-third in a  series planned with the
              purpose of bringing together a group of  mathematics interested in a particular
              field of mathematical  research.  Emphasis is placed on instruction at a very
              high level  with seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in 
              related fields, to promote interaction between participants while  broadening
              their mathematical perspectives.    "Cohomology representations and actions of
              finite groups" has  been selected as the topic of the 1996 Summer Research
              Institute  by the 1994 AMS Committee on Summer Institutes and Special 
              Symposia.    The 1996 Institute will be held in San Diego, California.  It is 
              expected to be held during a three-week period in July/August,  1996.
