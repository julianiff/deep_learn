Abstract    :
              9526357  Composto  The proposed resesarch on A/B:C blends will be the first 
              attempt to study the behavior of the complex interfacial  profiles and
              properties associated with three-component, two-  phase systems.  Both model
              and commercial systems will be  studied including polystyrene blends and
              poly(methyl  methacrylate blends.  The interfacial properties will be  modeled
              using the self-consistent field method.  To  complement these direct profiling
              measurements, neutron  reflectivity experiments will be carried out at National
               Laboratories.  In the third phase of the proposed research,  the physics which
              underlies the wetting transition will be  studied using a three-component
              polymer blend as a model  system.  %%%  These studies may allow a polymer
              engineer to tune the  morphology of complex blends by simply varying the degree
              of  polymerization or concentration to achieve either  encapsulated or
              separated phase domains.  In addition to  their intrinsic interest, the
              interfacial segregation and  wetting studies on three-component systems will
              serve as a  springboard for understanding more complicated systems such  as
              those containing four-components and three-phases.  ***
