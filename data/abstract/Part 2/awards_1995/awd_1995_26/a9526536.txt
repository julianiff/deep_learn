Abstract    :
              9526536  Patchett  The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the large
              variability in initial (Nd values that have been reported for several early
              Archean gneisses.  It is essential for a serious and thorough discussion of
              models of early Earth evolution to determine whether these initial (Nd values
              are real or if they are produced by disturbances in the Sm-Nd system. 
              Preliminary work on this project has been completed and has shown that the Hf
              isotopic compositions of zircons from these early gneisses are consistent with
              their whole-rock Nd isotopic compositions and as such verify the early
              incompatible-element depletion of the mantle.  The P.I.s have not yet been able
              to analyze zircons from those gneisses with negative (as low as -4.0) and
              highly positive (up to +4.0) initial (Nd  values.  The P.I.'s groundwork on
              this project has demonstrated the complexity of these rocks, and that a
              solution to this problem can only be achieved by analysis of carefully selected
              samples.  The P.I.s proposes three studies:  (1) investigation of highly
              positive (Nd values reported for Greenland gneisses; (2) evaluation of
              disturbances in Lu-Hf and U-Pb in samples with known Sm-Nd disturbances; (3)
              evaluation of the range of Nd values (-4 to +4) in the Acasta gneisses.
