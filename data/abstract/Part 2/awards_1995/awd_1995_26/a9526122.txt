Abstract    :
              9526122  Harrison       Funds are provided to hold a workshop on "Sea Level
              Change"  at University of Miami in November, 1995.  The workshop  participants
              will discuss various facets of sea-level change and  the unresolved questions
              about the various factors that can  produce the observed signal of ca. 1.5
              mm/year sea-level rise  indicated by tide-gauge records.  Geodetic, gravity,
              physical  oceanographic, rheological and geological data on sea level will  be
              reviewed and an attempt will be made to assess both  observational and modeling
              information.  Funds for the workshop  are being provided jointly by NSF and
              NOAA.  ***
