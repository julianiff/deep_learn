Abstract    :
              9526233  Menke      This research is an ancillary experiment to the Mid-Atlantic
              Ridge in Iceland Experiment (MARIE) volcanic hazard assessment survey being
              planned by European scientists for the mid-Atlantic plate boundary in North
              Iceland, which is also an area of seismic activity.  Several seismic arrays
              will be deployed that supplement the European coverage and which are directed
              to using shear waves to define the deep crustal segmentation of the plate
              boundary.  The critical questions are whether lower crustal shear wave
              attenuation, which is taken as a proxy for temperature, varies along the
              ridge-parallel direction and whether this variation is related to the central
              volcanoes that express the surficial segmentation, and/or to heat transport
              across the Moho.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
