Abstract    :
              Abstract:     The objective of the proposed work is to process and interpret
              seismic and GPR data to determine depth to velocity discontinuities and to
              modify techniques used to process and interpret these data.  Recordings of
              teleseismic P-phases will be used to interpret P-to-S conversions for upper
              mantle discontinuities.  Regional events will also be processes to determine
              the feasibility of augmenting the teleseismic information with interpretation
              of reflected energy from upper mantle discontinuities.  The results will be
              used to design additional seismic experiments with the ultimate goal of
              producing a detailed map of the thickness of the transition zone (the interval
              between the 410 and 660 km discontinuities).  Laboratory experiments using
              scale modeling of GPR reflections will be used to refine the interpretation
              techniques.  The advanced understanding of interpretive work in the electrical
              and seismic techniques will be combined to improve the resolution of both
              methods.      The PI will attend a short course on GPR methods to polish his
              skills in this technique, which is relatively new to him. GPR studies on
              physical models permit refinement of the interpretive methods.  These
              refinements may then be used to improve interpretations of seismic data.  At
              the same time, the PI has demonstrated the ability of the velocity spectrum
              stacking method to resolve thickness of a layer more accurately than absolute
              depth.  This technique may be especially valuable for interpretation shallow
              reflection data where absolute depth my be well known from drilling.   
              Anticipated products are a research proposal to create a much more refined map
              of the thickness of the transition zone, and an Instrumentation and Laboratory
              Improvement proposal for undergraduate instruction in field GPR techniques.
