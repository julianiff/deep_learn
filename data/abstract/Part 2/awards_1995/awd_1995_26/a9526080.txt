Abstract    :
              9526080  Wright    This  project  will  study  many questions  related  to  the 
              development  of  an  Integrated  Infrastructure   Management  System  (IIMS) 
              as  an organizing theme.  Specifically,  the  following  five  topics  will  be
               considered:   (1)   asset  valuation  and cost estimation; (2)  latent class
              models  of  infrastructure  facility deterioration;  (3)   modeling  the 
              interaction   between   urban   economic   activities    and  infrastructure 
              renewal;  (4)   methods  for  exploring   N-  dimensional  objective space; (5)
               total factor productivity  and  the  management of civil infrastructure 
              systems.   The  participation of practicing professionals of a stake  holder 
              partnership  and  faculty outside  civil  engineering  is  a  prominent aspect
              of the project.
