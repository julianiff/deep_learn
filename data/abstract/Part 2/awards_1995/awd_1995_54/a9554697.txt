Abstract    :
              A comprehensive course in polymer chemistry, comprising lecture,  discussion,
              laboratory, and field trips is designed for college  faculty who wish to
              incorporate material on polymers into lower  division chemistry courses or to
              teach upper division courses in  polymer chemistry.  The pedagogical approach
              aims to overcome much  of the reluctance to consider polymer chemistry as an
              important  aspect of undergraduate training in chemistry.  The course includes 
              polymer synthesis, modification, and molecular level  characterization and
              physical properties of macromolecules.   Biopolymers, especially lesser known
              ones such as the polyesters  produced by some bacteria, are included.  Polymer
              recycling is  discussed.  Contemporary topics in research in polymer chemistry 
              such as polymers for microelectronics, biomaterials, and  electronically
              conducting polymers also is included.  Visits to the  National Plastics Museum
              in Leominster, MA, Mypro, Inc., in  Clinton, MA, and the General Electric
              Research and Development  center in Schenectady, NY, are also planned.
