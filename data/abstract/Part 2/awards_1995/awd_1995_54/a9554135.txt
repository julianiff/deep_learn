Abstract    :
                abstract    9554135  Weissglass    This is a 4-year Local Systemic Change
              project at $2,249,778 to enhance 750 K-8 teachers in 35 schools from Oxnard and
              Ventura, California school districts.  The enhancement is focused on California
              Framework-based mathematics and instruction.  Districts will adopt
              comprehensive Framework-focused instructional materials based on pilot use of
              materials prior to the adoption.  Elementary school teachers will receive 22
              days (132 hours) of enhancement over the 4 years of the project.  Middle school
              teachers' 12 days of enhancement will build on current work in the Mathematics
              Renaissance project (California SSI).  School/family partnerships will be a
              thrust of this effort with teachers conducting programs with parents in their
              own schools.  Helping teachers improve the understanding of and interest in
              mathematics of students from underrepresented groups will be an important
              component.  District-based cost-sharing of $859,188.
