Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    ESI 9554180  Koroly    The focus of this national project  is the
              integration of research and education in a 7-week summer residential program at
              the University of Florida. The 7-week summer residential portion begins with a
              week of intensive, hands-on  workshops in Biotechnology and Physics/Engineering
              content along with computer instruction. Then each teacher is assigned to a
              different laboratory scientist and becomes part of the lab's research team for
              30-hours per week.  This is complemented by a leadership component designed to
              empower teachers to effect change in their local districts. The program will
              enroll 25 middle and high school teachers the first year, 40 the second, 35 the
              third, 40 the fourth and 45 in the fifth. Teachers may earn graduate credit.
