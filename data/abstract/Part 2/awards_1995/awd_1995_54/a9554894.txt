Abstract    :
              We propose major changes in the typical undergraduate science curriculum by
              drastically changing the large lecture format. We plan to use new technology to
              allow the interactive participation of students in the lecture. At the same
              time our plans also include the use of peer instruction during the lecture.   
              The economics of today and projections for the future suggest that lecture
              classes can only increase in size and that revitalization of the large lecture
              is a necessity. Revitalization is also necessary since large scale dropouts are
              a problem which plague introductory science (especially physics) courses, and
              these dropouts have a large, usually minority, student component. IIT has a
              strong representation of students from Chicago high schools. The poor
              preparation (by no means limited to Chicago) adds to the urgency of the
              problem.    We have initiated an experiment using commercial wireless keypads
              and software during the Spring semester 1995 to make a large lecture class feel
              smaller, to provide on-line feedback to the lecturer and to provide motivation
              for students in a large class (greater than 40) to actively participate in the
              learning process. While our experiment has been not quite a semester in length
              in several different classes, its promise suggests further trials and
              improvements. Since much of our equipment was borrowed we are requesting
              funding to pursue the development and assessment of this program for a two year
              period.    We plan to monitor our progress and describe the results at major
              American Association of Physics Teachers meetings as well as local meetings
              which are to be followed by written reports. Preliminary results of our work
              were presented at the AAPT meeting in Spokane in August, 1995.    This project
              is being carried out by two experienced teachers; the PI of this project has
              been teaching introductory physics for over 30 years.
