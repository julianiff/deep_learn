                 Special Project  2153 Sheridan Road  Evanston, IL  60208    This is a
              proposal to conduct a workshop on Ethics and  Biotechnology:  A Blueprint for
              the future.  The directors of the  Biotechnology Center at Northwestern
              University will collaborate  with the Executive Officer at Palomar College, a
              two year college  in San Marcos, California and with Providence St. Mel, an
              inner  city high school in Chicago.  The workshop, will be held July 6-7, 
              1995, at Northwestern University's Evanston Campus, is designed to  provide a
              blueprint for the incorporation of ethics in the  teaching, practice and
              management of biotechnology.  The  information will be used to add to the
              biotechnology curricula for  technician education and to encourage joint
              efforts by secondary  schools, two-year colleges, four-year colleges and
              universities,  and industry.  In addition, it will provide a mechanism to
              develop  creative ways for this information to be taught, practiced, and 
              managed in their respective institutions.
