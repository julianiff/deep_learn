Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to convene workshops and seminars to  plan and develop
              ilstructional materials that will use the  Internet and Worldwide Web to
              interlink the cufficula of  geography departments throughout the United States.
               The  goal of the project is to build high quality curriculum  materials
              including "electronic" textbooks and interactive  modules that: 1) span the
              entire undergraduate curriculum,  2) exploit further the potential of existing
              Internet  resources, and 3) take full advantage of the hypermedia  format of
              the Worldwide Web.  The project will allow  geographers at many universities to
              work toward common goals  and share the time and expense of developing the
              sorts of  hypermedia curriculum materials that are likely to become  the
              hallmark of higher education in the twenty-first  century.  The project
              addresses three important challenges  facing contemporary higher education: 1)
              to provide faculty  with the skills needed to create hypermedia instructional 
              materials and use the Worldwide Web effectively, 2) to set  goals for the
              development of the discipline-specific  educational resources that will support
              the emergence of  "virtual" departments and even "virtual" universities, and 
              3) to help transform the Worldwide Web from an adhoc and  improvised collection
              of materials into an orderly and  systematically developed resource for
              education and  research.  To reach these goals, two week workshops will be 
              held at the University of Texas during the summers of 1996,  1997, and 1998 to
              bring together thirty faculty from  universities across the nation. 
              Participants will set goals  for the development of new materials, gain skills
              in  hypermedia authoring, and write the first modules.  One day  seminars will
              also be held at the national meetings of the  National Council for Geographic
              Education and the  Association of American Geographers to: 1) evaluate and 
              refine materials, 2) present the new materials to a larger  professional
              audience, and 3) offer hands-on training.
