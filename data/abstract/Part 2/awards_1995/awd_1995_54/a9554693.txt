Abstract    :
              This proposal offers solutions to the wise and effective use of  Internet and
              multimedia, illustrated by concrete applications of  these technologies.  It
              will provide for summer workshops for  teachers, 2 and 4 year college faculty,
              community leaders, and some  in the local business community. The underlying
              networking  technologies developed by the lead 2 year college, and the evolving
               new paradigm for its use provide a model for others in the nation  to
              consider.  Most of the content for these workshops will be based  on recent
              experience in creating the Community Networks (CoNets) in  Southeastern
              Minnesota, and a new 2-year curriculum in Networking  communicating (NetCo). 
              CoNet kiosks are linked collaboratively via  the Internet.  The NetCo
              curriculum will help and lead builders of  networking facilities. These
              workshop, directed at mostly 2-year  college faculty, will help them implement
              the developed 2-year  curriculum.  These proposed workshops in 1996 and 1997,
              will be  expanded from earlier ones given in 1995.  They will cover areas in 
              Minnesota, eastern Dakotas, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin,  using 2-way
              interactive TV linked to the workshop providers at  Austin College Park. In
              1997, the providers will attempt to expand  to the national level, to allow
              telecommunication of the workshops  to many other 2 and 4 year colleges.
