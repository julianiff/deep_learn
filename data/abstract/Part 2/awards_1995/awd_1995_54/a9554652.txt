Abstract    :
              This project focuses on a 1-week summer follow-up workshop on UG  faculty
              enhancement in the area of computer networks.  Twenty  computer science and
              mathematics faculty from small  colleges/universities, who participated in a
              2-week workshop at MSU  during the summer of 1994, will be invited back to MSU
              during the  1996 summer, for additional training and experiences.  The proposed
               5-day follow-up will involve: sessions for assembling and fine-  tuning
              courseware materials (especially laboratory assignments),  sessions for sharing
              experiences relative teaching computer  networks, intensive laboratory training
              on using software packages  designed to enhance teaching computer networks. 
              The courseware  material will be placed on the WWW for easy access by both 
              participants, and the CS community. Experts in computer networks  will be
              available during the workshop to assist and talk with  participants. As a
              follow-up of the proposed project, a quarterly  newsletter will be available to
              participants via the WWW. Some of  the participants will attend the SIGCSE
              conference to report on  their evaluations and "lessons learned".
