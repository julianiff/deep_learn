Abstract    :
              ***  9554602  Harenda    This project is for a one year planning grant to
              support planning for systemic change in the area of science education.  The
              focus of this initiative is hands-on, inquiry science teaching and learning. 
              The targeted teachers are K-5.      A team of stakeholders consisting of
              teachers, administrators, business partners and community representatives will
              be identified and brought together to develop a comprehensive plan to implement
              an elementary hands-on, inquiry-based science program coordinated with grades
              K-12.    Activities will include:     Self-study.  A systematic and thorough
              district-wide (K-12) study of the Plymouth-Canton Community School District to
              determine its strength and weakness as it relates to science education reform. 
              Identify internal funding sources and a plan to sustain systemic reform.    
              Research.  Research of reform strategies, existing science units,
              staff-development models, materials supply and refurbishing systems, funding
              plans, and the goals and objectives of the Michigan Statewide Systemic
              Initiative.    The plan developed under this grant will be presented to the
              National Science Foundation as a full grant proposal to support systemic
              science education reform in the Plymouth-Canton Community School District.   
              Cost sharing will be $10,950.     The project requested $49,805 from NSF with
              21% cost sharing.   ***
