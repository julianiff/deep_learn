Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to present faculty members with an  integrated
              methodology for teaching undergraduate control theory  and its application to a
              wide variety of mechatronic systems.  The  program combines the insight and
              understanding of classical control  (frequency domain) theory with the
              computational power of modern  control (time domain) theory.  Often, the tools
              of these two  domains are taught in separate sections of a course, or in
              separate  courses.  This need not be the case, as is demonstrated in our 
              undergraduate and graduate courses at Georgia institute of  Technology.  The GA
              Tech classroom approach will be integrated into  the mechatronics laboratory
              curriculum developed at RPI to provide  the students with the ability to
              realize their control designs on  inexpensive controllers. Through this course
              we will provide  faculty with the means to educate students such that they will
               develop an excellent intuitive understanding of control theory, a  firm grasp
              on powerful computational tools currently available, and  the ability to
              physically implement these systems.  The integration  of theory, computer tools
              and laboratory experiences will yield an  educational opportunity for the
              students that far exceeds any  standard classroom experience currently taught.
