Abstract    :
              9554473  Martin    Under the Planning Grant Guidelines, the Arizona Science
              Center  will explore "Using Narrative to Introduce Science Concepts to  Diverse
              Audiences at a Science Center."  By bringing together a  group of experts to
              review key questions about the uses and  structure of narrative, the staff of
              the science center will 1)  develop a strategy and range of approaches to
              science storytelling,  2) develop ideas for story premises and texts to
              interest visitors  representing diverse populations and including women, people
              in  non-technical occupations and minority families, 3) conduct  research to
              determine visitor's attitudes to these materials in  order to learn about the
              appeal and effectiveness of the  narratives.  Finally, they will synthesize and
              broadly disseminate  their findings.  The discussion will be focused on a
              comprehensive  set of 120 exhibits entitled "How We Live With The Sun."  The 
              topics include light and optics; heat, cooling, and convection;  weather,
              electricity; and technologies for harnessing solar energy.   These topics
              represent the physical science that underlies the way  people adapt to the
              desert and the ways in which Arizonans have  applied knowledge of science
              fundamentals to useful ends.
