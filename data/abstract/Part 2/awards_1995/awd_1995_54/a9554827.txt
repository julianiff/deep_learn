Abstract    :
              This project will design an Environmental Geology laboratory  course that
              addresses urban and suburban problems in a scientific  manner. Exercises
              designed for this course will be practical,  based on a problems that that
              could be encountered in a variety of  urban settings, with solutions derived
              through quantitative  analysis of datasets on the computer. Students will be
              asked to  evaluate or design remediation methods for a number of  environmental
              problems. Several instruments will be designed and  built for this project.
              Northern New Jersey is the ideal area to  develop such a course because it is
              largely urban or suburban,  because it contains many severe environmental
              hazards at all  scales, and because New Jersey spends more per capita on 
              environmental clean up than any other state in the union. The  Rutgers-Newark
              campus contains a culturally and ethnically diverse  student body that is
              largely from this highly populated area;  urban environmental geology issues
              will have particular relevance  for this student clientele, and will help to
              recruit minority  participation in geoscience education.
