Abstract    :
              9554478  Sullivan    ABSTRACT:  ZOOM! is the Emmy Award-winning series for 8 to
              11 year olds that ran on PBS for six years in the 1970's.  WGBH, where the
              series was produced, is hoping to update the series and produce new programs
              for national broadcast.  This planning grant will enable WGBH to make planning
              for math and science education an integral part of the piloting phase the
              station is about to enter.  Specific activities to be conducted with the NSF
              support include such things as:    o Holding a series of science and math
              brainstorming sessions,    o Revamping the series advisory committee by adding
              more people with expertise in math, science, and elementary education,    o
              Hiring a science and mathematics content director,    o Consulting with
              outreach partners to develop ways to extend the series' impact beyond the
              television audience,    o Refining the science and mathematics goals,    o
              Developing methods to integrate science and math into the programs,    o
              Producing sample math/science segments, using different approaches    o Testing
              the sample segments for audience effectiveness.
