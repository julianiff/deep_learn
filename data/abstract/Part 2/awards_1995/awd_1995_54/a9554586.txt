Abstract    :
              GER-9554586  Root    The Nation has a pressing need for  chemical engineers who
              are  conscious of environmental  prerogatives and are able to  discover
              innovative new processes  that will satisfy chemical demands  and meet
              environmental and economic  criteria. We are requesting  Graduate Research
              Traineeships in  Catalysis for Environmentally  Conscious Manufacturing. The 
              trainees will gain expertise in  developing new catalytic  technologies that
              can b used for  production of desired chemical  products or intermediates with 
              little or no generation of  undesired waste or byproducts. The  Department of
              Chemical Engineering  has substantial expertise in  catalyst design, process
              design,  and analysis. The focus on  environmental consequences of  upstream
              processing decisions will  train students to optimize the  entire chemical
              process through use  of appropriate catalytic  technologies, and permit 
              development of alternative chemical  synthesis pathways that are 
              environmentally benign. The  chemical industry is one of the  largest
              contributors to  international trade, and chemical  engineers trained in
              environmental  consequences will be critical in  maintaining competitiveness.
              Our  training program will produce  engineers who will receive not only  the
              excellent academic training for  which Wisconsin chemical engineers  are know,
              but also a research and  educational experience that will  develop awareness of
              and ingrained  concern for the environmental  implications of their
              professional  activities.
