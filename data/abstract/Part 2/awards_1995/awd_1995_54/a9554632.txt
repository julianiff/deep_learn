Abstract    :
              The Maryland Undergraduate Mathematics Enhancement Program II  (MUMEP II) is a
              coalition of community college, 4-year college, and  university undergraduate
              mathematics teaching faculty in the  general region of Maryland, the District
              of Columbia, and Virginia,  organized around a two-year faculty enhancement
              program for 32  participants during each of the years 1996 and 1997. In July
              1996  a one-week workshop will explore Visual Thinking in Chaotic  Dynamics and
              in July 1997 a one-week workshop will explore Visual  Thinking in Fractal
              Geometry.  A pair of day-long follow-up  seminars will take place during the
              academic year following each  workshop. The primary goals of MUMEP II are: 1)
              to present new  visual mathematical topics to faculty from institutions in the 
              region and to use graphics calculators and computer graphics to  enhance
              understanding of the new visual mathematical topics; 2) to  relate the new
              visual mathematics topics to existing undergraduate  mathematics courses
              wherever reasonable; 3) to promote  communication and collaboration among
              faculty in the area's  institutions. In addition, special teacher preparation
              activities  are planned to engage faculty who teach significant numbers of pre-
               service teachers. In particular, the project's recruiting efforts  will look
              for opportunities to involve such faculty, and workshop  activities will
              showcase lessons that can be incorporated in  mathematics classes taken by
              prospective teachers and in school  mathematics classes as well. All materials
              prepared for or during  a workshop or seminar will be disseminated during the
              session or  shortly thereafter.  Under the guidance of members of an Advisory 
              Board, evaluation of the program will be facilitated through daily  and summary
              questionnaires.
