Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to offer a summer workshop for undergraduate  faculty in
              plant reproductive biology pollination biology and plant  reproduction for
              undergraduate research and curricula.  The  workshop will include a mixture of
              lectures, laboratory, field work  and short individual research project. 
              Pollination biology and  plant reproductive biology will be the emphasis
              because the subject  can be approached from a wide range of disciplines which
              makes it  an excellent topic for application to a variety of undergraduate 
              courses and research projects which will later be incorporated into  individual
              courses.
