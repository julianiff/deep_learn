Abstract    :
              This project is intended to promote a new style of differential   equations
              instruction, one that emphasizes concepts and applications   and one that
              involves faculty members from both the mathematics and   engineering
              communities. We will share the results of the Boston   University Differential
              Equations Project in developing and   implementing a radical revision of the
              traditional sophomore-level   differential equations course designed to achieve
              these goals.  The   project will also feature presentations from an engineer
              who teaches   courses that depend heavily on the differential equations course.
                 To emphasize the way in which differential equations are used   throughout a
              student's education, participants will take part in   collaborative activities
              in small groups that include both   engineering and mathematics faculty
              members.  The goal is to promote   a style of differential equations
              instruction that better engages   and serves students throughout their college
              and professional careers.
