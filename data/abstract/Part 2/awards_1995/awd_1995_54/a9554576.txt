Abstract    :
              GER-9554576  Beckman    In recent years we have observed  extensive interest
              among industrial  BS-level engineers, chemists, and  biologists in returning to
              school  to pursue a PhD in chemical  engineering. In each of these  cases, the
              parent company has  contributed significantly to the  work via access to
              corporate  analytical labs, chemical samples,  and outright cash gifts. Given
              that  we have found that these non-  traditional students are often  amongst
              our best graduate students,  due to their drive, experience, and  maturity, we
              propose to employ the  title graduate fellowships to  support an increased
              number of such  students in PhD research. Our  experience is that research 
              programs which emphasize water  minimization are of great interest  to our
              industrial colleagues, and  thus we feel that use of the  proposed fellowships
              in the area of  waste minimization to attract  students returning to school
              form  industry will lead to a large  number of  applicants. Further, we 
              propose to collaborate with the  University of Pittsburgh  Manufacturing
              Engineering Program  by offering Pollution Prevention  over MSEP's distance
              learning  program. By participation in MSEP  we foster greater interaction with
               local industry, and can identify  and recruit students with interests  in
              continuing on for the PhD vial  research in waste minimization  topics.
