Abstract    :
              9554495  Karnawat    Turtle Mountain Community College, on the Turtle Mountain
              Indian Reservation in North  Dakota, is to conduct a four-week summer commuter
              project in mathematics for Native  American high school girls.  The primary
              objective of the MEGA program is to ensure that a  cadre of promising young
              Native American women is prepared for, and matriculates  into mathematics and
              mathematics-based disciplines, including engineering, at the college level.  
              The girls in the program will be involved in the problem solving activities. 
              The emphasis will  be on applications, and much of the data for this study will
              be collected from field trips to  cultural sites on the reservation.  A field
              trip to the North Dakota State University will be  offered at the end of the
              summer component of the program.  The girls will be kept actively  engaged
              during the academic year through their participation in Sunday academies.     
              The MEGA project is designed to stimulate interest, increase participation,
              improve  achievement, increase visibility, and accelerate career advancement
              and success in mathematics  and related areas for young women on the Turtle
              Mountain Reservation, and to provide a model  which might be replicated on
              other reservations.  ***
