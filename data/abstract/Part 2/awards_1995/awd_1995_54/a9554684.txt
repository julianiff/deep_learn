Abstract    :
              This project is intended for faculty who are searching for new  pedagogical
              approaches and new uses of technology to teach calculus  to
              mathematically-at-risk students--students who are not prepared  to enter the
              traditional calculus sequence, but need to acquire  fundamental calculus
              concepts for use in other disciplines or  further study of mathematics.  The
              project is based on the Workshop  Calculus program, developed at Dickinson
              College with support from  the Fund for Improvement of Post Secondary Education
              (FIPSE) and  the National Science Foundation (NSF).  One-week Workshop Calculus
               immersion seminars are being offered in the summers of 1996 and  1997, with
              twenty-four participants invited each summer.  The  primary purpose of the
              summer seminars is to provide participants  with the necessary background and
              support to adapt the Workshop  Calculus materials for use in their own
              environments, and to forge  the necessary liaisons to help them successfully
              implement their  projects.  To help accomplish this, participants will:  (1)
              learn  to use interactive teaching methods such as guided inquiry, 
              collaborative learning and experiential learning cycles--that is,  to use the
              workshop approach--to enhance student learning; (2) gain  experience using
              technology--including a computer algebra system,  the mathematical programming
              language ISETL, and  Microcomputer-Based-Laboratory tools--to help students
              understand  fundamental calculus concepts; and (3) customize Workshop Calculus 
              instructional materials for use at their home institutions and  design their
              own workshop-based courses; and (4) refine existing  assessment tools to
              analyze the impact of the workshop approach on  the attitudes and learning
              gains of students at their institutions.
