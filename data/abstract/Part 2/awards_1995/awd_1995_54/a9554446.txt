Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to convene a three-day working conference to design
              an  undergraduate curriculum for the 21st century.  The conference will serve
              as a forum  for consensus-building on the guiding principles for undergraduate
              education in the  next century. Representatives from business/industry,
              mathematics, science,  engineering, and technology disciplines will share their
              expertise and experiences and  exchange ideas on curriculum design and delivery
              through plenary sessions, working  groups, and other activities. The primary
              outcome of the project, a comprehensive  model for undergraduate education in
              the form of a conference report, will serve as a  curriculum-building resource
              and model for the new Florida Gulf Coast University and  other institutions
              across the nation. By synthesizing new ideas in one place at one  time, the
              conference report is likely to have a significant impact on existing structures
               of institutions and their curricula.
