Abstract    :
              The thrust of this project is to attack problems faced by  institutions of
              providing a high quality introductory computer  science curriculum while
              developing strategies to better utilize  the potential of student interaction
              in their learning process.   This project brings together a diverse group of 30
              computer science  educators for an ongoing process in the application of peer 
              learning to the introductory areas of Computer Science education.  Invited
              participants will address problems of teaching introductory  courses by this
              peer learning process (ie., students learning in  collaboration, and with some
              faculty guidance).  This forum  provides a hands-on environment for using and
              developing activities  with this method.  Outcomes from the work include the
              instructional  materials produced along with a common assessment of their 
              application to the faculty members home Computer Science program.  A final
              report will be produced at a follow-up workshop in the 2nd  year, and made
              widely available to the CS community through the  WWW.
