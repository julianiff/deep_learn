Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to study the feasibility of  creating a pilot program
              for the certification of  engineering students for teaching in secondary
              schools. It  is clear that a number of engineering students would  choose 
              secondary school teaching as a career, if the certification  requirements would
              not prevent them from doing so. Presently  there appears to be no effective
              path to place these  talented and dedicated students into the secondary school 
              classroom.  Given the complexity of the process of secondary  teacher
              certification, the development of a pilot program  for the nation is
              challenging. Preliminary indications, as a  result of discussions with the
              North Carolina Board of  Education, the personnel of the Duke teacher
              certification  program , and the Duke University Master of Arts in Teaching 
              program indicate that the development of a model requires  extensive
              discussions and evaluations.  The project is  undertaking the task of
              developing a comprehensive and  useful pilot program for encouraging
              engineering students to  enter secondary education.
