Abstract    :
              GER-9554506  Tom    The goal of our proposed training  program is to produce
              scientists  with unique and timely skills for  making significant contributions
              to  the nation's environmental  problems. We believe an  interdisciplinary PhD
              training  program in environmental physics  which combines a foundation in soil
               and environmental sciences with  recently developed experimental and 
              mathematical techniques of physics  can fulfill this goal. The proposed 
              program will include specialized  training in:       1) the application of 
              nonlinear optical and other surface  physics techniques to understand 
              microscopic processes at the  soil/water, air/water and oil/water  interfaces; 
                   2) the use of molecular  dynamics, percolation theory and  other
              mathematical  techniques to  model water flow, contaminant  reaction, and
              transport in soil and  ground water systems.
