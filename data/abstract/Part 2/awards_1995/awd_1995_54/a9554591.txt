Abstract    :
              GER-9554591  Moharam  The Center for Research and  Education in Optics and
              Lasers  (CREOL) is an interdisciplinary  academic center comprised of  tenured
              and tenure-track faculty at  the University of Central Florida  (UCF). Since
              its inception in 1986,  the center has grown to become an  internationally
              recognized center  of excellence in optics with 26  faculty, 25 PhD-level
              research  scientists, and 70 graduate  students. UCF offers PhD programs  in
              Optical Physics, Optical Science  & Engineering and Electrical  Engineering
              with Specialization in  Electro-Optics. By innovative use  of NSF and matching
              funds, CREOL  proposes to recruit 20 new students  over five years, from a
              diverse  pool across the USA, into an NSF  Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) 
              program that will train PhDs in the  nationally critical field of  optical
              science and engineering. To  achieve this end, each GRT student  will
              participate in a research  project, supervised by an  internationally
              recognized faculty  researcher in one of the six  subdisciplines described in
              the  proposal. These subdisciplines  represent the new growth areas of 
              research in the center and those in  which new faculty have recently  been
              hired. The GRT students will  receive a training that will  include instruction
              and advisement  by internationally recognized  faculty, industrial internships,
               instruction and practice in  undergraduate teaching and  interaction with
              students and  faculty from international  locations.
