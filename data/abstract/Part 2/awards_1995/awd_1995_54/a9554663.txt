Abstract    :
              Faculty at the University of Southern Mississippi will conduct a  series of
              workshops with mathematics faculty from two-year colleges  who teach
              pre-service teachers. Coordination between faculty at  two- and four-year
              institutions is critical, as an increasing  number of students in pre-service
              teacher preparation programs at  the university level transfer from two-year
              schools. The workshops  will provide access to experiences with current
              approaches to  mathematics content and pedagogical activities called for by the
               NCTM Standards. This project will provide participants with the  material and
              support necessary to successfully incorporate the  workshop topics into their
              present curricula, and to develop the  capability of all participants to serve
              as leaders in their home  institutions. Furthermore, participants will share
              their approaches  to incorporating project topics into the curricula through 
              publications and presentations at professional meetings.
