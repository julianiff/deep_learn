Abstract    :
              This work proposes a four course sequence during the first  two years of the
              engineering curriculum to simulate the  concepts of vertical integration.  This
              sequence will be  implemented within existing curricula and is thus cost 
              effective and not resource constrained.  The goals and  objectives of this work
              are to provide an alternative  procedure for vertical integration of material
              that works  within current frameworks, to increase student retention  between
              the first and second year of engineering curriculum,  to enhance the
              educational experience of engineering  students through the integration of
              mathematics, physics,  chemistry, and engineering science, to produce
              engineering  students that are creative, critical thinkers and mature 
              independent learners, and that are aware of the engineering  role in society as
              a whole.    The main contribution of this work will be the development  of an
              integration scheme that can be implemented within  existing curricula without
              taxing budgets or resources and  without political concerns.  The results of
              this project  will also be transferable to other schools and to science  and
              non-technical divisions as well.
