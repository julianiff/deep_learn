Abstract    :
              This curriculum project focuses on six courses: Introductory  Anatomy &
              Physiology, Microanatomy, Developmental Biology,  Statistics, Mathematical
              Modeling, and Math Seminar. The project  addresses the dual problems of: 1)
              encouraging biology students  to approach their discipline in terms of
              quantitative problem  solving and; 2) engaging applied mathematics students in
              devising  and solving mathematical problems which interface with the  sciences.
              The courses selected are populated by a wide range of  students: lower
              division, upper division, science major, and non-  science major. Through
              digital interfaces with microscopes and  physiological transducers, the
              selected biology courses yield  large interactive databases which are compliant
              to statistical  analysis. These data bases are incorporated into inquiry-based 
              undergraduate biology laboratory exercises which emphasize  statistical methods
              of analysis. In addition a mathematics  mentoring program is being established.
              The resultant exercises  and experiences are being disseminated to a large
              audience  through presentations, the Internet, publications, and commercial 
              distribution. Through this curriculum development project  undergraduate
              students learn why they need numerical data and how  to generate the necessary
              data.
