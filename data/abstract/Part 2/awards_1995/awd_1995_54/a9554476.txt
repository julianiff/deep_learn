Abstract    :
              9554476  Oberhauser    This three year project is to establish a network of
              students,  teachers, researchers and volunteers to investigate various aspects 
              of the monarch butterfly migration phenomenon.  A curriculum is  proposed that
              will encompass the biology of monarchs, the migration  research and
              experimental, hands on activites along with authentic  research for children in
              grades K-12.  Two groups, each of which  includes numerous classroom teachers
              are engaged in developing the  curriculum; Dr. Karen Oberhauser and her team at
              the University of  Minnesota will develop activities and materials appropriate
              to the  lower grades and Dr. Orley Taylor and Mr. Brad Williamson at the 
              University of Kansas will develop activities and materials  appropriate for
              secondary level students.  Project dissemination  will be by the Internet and
              professional meetings.  End products of  this project include a Monarch
              Handbook and supporting  instructional videotapes.
