Abstract    :
              9554130  Herr    This three year project, sponsored by Catlin Gable School of 
              Portland, Oregon, will prepare high school teachers of physics to  use teaching
              techniques based upon the latest developed  instrumentation and to apply this
              knowledge in their high school  physics classes.  Twenty teachers will attend
              three-week workshops  at three sites: Portland, Oregon; Omaha, Nebraska; and
              Palo Alto,  California, for a total of 60 teachers enhanced each year.    The
              program will teach the teachers physics content as well as  pedagogy based upon
              the latest research on student misconceptions.   When the project is over, the
              teachers will be able to use   instrumental techniques to clarify key physics
              concepts.  They will  be taught how to build some of their own equipment from
              components  easily found at local electronics and hardware stores and develop 
              laboratory modules based upon these instruments.  In total each  participant
              will have about 100 instrument based experiments which  can be used in the
              classroom.  Each module developed by the  participants is evaluated by a well
              know physics educator.  When  these teachers return to their schools, they will
              be provided  access to the internet and thus will be given support and 
              information from other teachers using these techniques.  Each  participant is
              required to carry out two workshops for other  physics teachers within a year
              after leaving the project.    Matching funds constitute about 30% of the NSF
              award.
