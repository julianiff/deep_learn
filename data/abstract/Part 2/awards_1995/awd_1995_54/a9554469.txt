Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed Research Planning Grant is to structure a three-year
              program of research on mathematical conversations among bilingual students.
              During the proposed R.P.G. project the Principal Investigator would complete
              literature reviews, conduct a pilot classroom study, consult with researchers
              in relevant areas, develop an initial theoretical framework, and design the
              subsequent research project  following the planning period the Principal;
              Investigator would submit a proposal to NSF for a three-year research project
              to investigate how middle-school Latino students construct mathematical meaning
              during bilingual (Spanish and English) conversations while using mathematical
              representations and concepts.
