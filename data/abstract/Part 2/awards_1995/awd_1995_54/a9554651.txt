Abstract    :
              The teaching of undergraduate mathematics courses for future school  teachers is
              being enriched by week-long summer workshops for  college and university
              faculty in which they will:  Goal 1.   experience new teaching strategies and
              techniques.  Goal 2.   experience examples of non-test based assessment
              schemes.  Goal 3.   learn about and observe these and other examples of
              pedagogical  techniques that have been successful in encouraging women and 
              underrepresented minorities to excel in mathematics.  Goal 4.   learn new
              subject matter and experience new instructional materials  being produced by
              the Cornell Undergraduate Geometry Project which  relate both modern and rarely
              studied geometry topics with the  mathematics subject matter of the middle and
              high schools.  Goal 5.   have the opportunity to interact and share with
              colleagues and  experts who have common interests in the teaching of
              mathematics to  future school teachers, and to develop plans to incorporate
              both  teaching techniques and new curricular materials into their own  courses.
               Goal 6.  learn about and share ideas concerning the  recent recommendations,
              guidelines and standards put forth by the  Mathematical Sciences Education
              Board (MSEB), the National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), and in
              publications of the  Mathematical Association of America (MAA) concerning
              changes in the  teaching of undergraduate mathematics.  Goal 7.  be committed
              to  participate after the workshop in several of the planned follow-up 
              activities.
