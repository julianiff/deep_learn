Abstract    :
              Matray  95-54325    The Monterey Bay Regional Education Futures (MBReEF)
              Consortium is a broad based collaboration of scientific research organizations,
              education, and government agencies, libraries, museums, and business/industry
              partners working to develop a collaborative educational networking
              infrastructure, Monterey BayNet, that would build a sustainable base and serve
              as a national model for the application of telecommunications technology to
              science education. It is designed to initiate collaborative efforts to a)
              integrate high speed data communications access (ATM, ISDN, and Frame Relay)
              and computer technologies, b) identify and make accessible relevant 'real
              world' data sources, e) develop interactive electronic field trips by
              student/client groups, educators, and scientific research communities in
              various ecosystems, and d) ultimately design access to these trips and their
              relevant datasets residing in a regional environmental electronic library.   
              Teams of scientists, educators, and students design initial electronic field
              trips around four exemplars: the Virtual Canyon Project with the Monterey Bay
              Aquarium and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the
              Watershed Project with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Moss
              Landing Marine Laboratories, the Virtual Telescope Project with the Monterey
              Institute for Research in Astronomy (MIRA), and Building Bridges on the Super
              Highway with Cabrillo College. These trips will utilize voice, video, and data
              originating at participating science research agencies, museums, and/or
              aquaria. In addition, real-time video and data will be provided from the bottom
              of the Monterey Bay Canyon via MBARI's undersea Remotely Operated Vehicle
              (ROV), from the watershed field sites, and 'from Andromeda' via MIRA's virtual
              telescope. As other participants take these trips, they can, in turn, create
              yet another level of electronic field trips for yet another group of peers
              based upon their experience, questions, and interactions. The  process,
              outcomes and ultimate curriculum products of each field trip created and taken
              become new input for a regional electronic environmental library. New trips,
              utilizing existing and new, successive inputs are then created and embarked
              upon in such a way that the entire information system is recursive and ever
              changing.    Access to the ultimate field trip utilizing such an infrastructure
              will result in:      improved quality and effectiveness of instruction and
              learning in the areas of regional/global marine and environmental studies and
              astronomy;    the use of data communications to increase access to
              informational, instructional, and technological resources (voice, video and
              data);    models for integrating cost-effective telecommunications networking
              into the science curriculum;    a migration model to allow schools and/or
              agencies to move from one communications service tier to the next as their
              needs and applications change;    definitions of the role of voice, video, and
              data communications in teacher training;    models for product and service
              dissemination, collaboration between diverse agencies. and military base
              conversion towards educational use.
