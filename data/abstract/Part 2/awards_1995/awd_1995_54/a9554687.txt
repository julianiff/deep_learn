Abstract    :
              Workshop participants will learn to design courseware  modules for undergraduate
              courses in science and engineering  classroom/laboratories.  Participants will
              learn about an  integrated classroom/laboratory environment that includes 
              computer-controlled instruments, application software for  data acquisition,
              simulation and data analysis, and some  fundamental issues in learning theory
              based on the Kolb  learning cycle and Bloom's taxonomy.  By the end of the 
              workshop, participants will design and author courseware  modules for use at
              their home institution.  The modules will  be shared with workshop colleagues
              and engineering and  science departments using the internet.    All
              participants will get hands-on experience with Bucknell  University's
              Electronic Classroom and several  classroom/laboratories equipped with
              multi-media PCs, data  acquisition and analysis software, simulation tools and 
              authoring software.    The workshop will include optional sessions on several 
              software packages including C/C++ programming, analysis  programs such as
              MATLAB and Mathcad, and simulation with  LabView.
