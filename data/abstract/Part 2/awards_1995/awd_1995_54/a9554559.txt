Abstract    :
              GER-9554559  Gosink                                  In determining priorities
              for the  research agenda for civil  infrastructure problems, there is a 
              growing recognition of the need for  integrated approaches to  infrastructure
              assessment and  repair. Strategies for the solution  of these problems must be
              based on  an interdisciplinary, coordinated  approach, with a systems 
              perspective. In this proposal we  describe an innovative visionary  graduate
              program in Engineering  Systems at the Colorado School of  Mines. This course
              of study is  deliberately designed to integrate  across traditional boundaries
              with  the intent of enabling graduates to  see connections between disparate 
              disciplines and methods of  analysis, to think in terms of a  systems approach,
              and to comprehend  the demands of the societal and  global marketplace. The
              proposal  sets forth the application of the  Engineering Systems Curricula and 
              research agenda to the problems of  the civil infrastructure, and  demonstrates
              how this program will  provide a strong and creative model  for training
              engineers to address  civil infrastructure problems. The  three focus areas of
              the  Engineering Systems program, energy  systems, mechanics and structural 
              systems, and applied sensors and  automation systems, each applies  directly to
              several civil  infrastructure problem areas. With  this background, graduates
              will  have the technical expertise, the  systems methodology, and the 
              corporate perspicacity to  effectively champion sound  technology transfer.
              Graduates will  be industry-oriented to take  leadership roles for rebuilding
              the  civil infrastructure.
