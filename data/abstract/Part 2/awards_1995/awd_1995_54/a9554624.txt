Abstract    :
              Georgia State University (GSU) and the Georgia Institute of  Technology (GIT)
              jointly propose an Undergraduate Faculty  Enhancement project in chemistry;
              recruitment of participants is to  be on a national basis. The project is
              designed to improve the  ability of faculty primarily at two- and four-year,
              public and  private, institutions to develop and teach a modern program in 
              chemistry.  The major activities of the proposed project are 11  five-day
              workshops and two annual reunions of the previous year's  participants. 
              Workshop topics are (1) Advanced Materials  Chemistry, (2) Chemistry of Nucleic
              Acids, (3) Environmental  Chemistry, (4) Mass Spectrometry, (5) Molecular
              Modeling, (6)  Molecular Orbital Theory, (7) Multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic 
              Resonance Spectroscopy, and (8) Multimedia Techniques in Chemistry.   The
              workshops will be taught primarily by GSU and GIT faculty;  members of the
              faculty from Indiana University, the University of  Georgia and the University
              of California at Irvine will also  participate.  Several former workshop
              participants will serve as  assistants in these activities.  Prominent
              specialists from other  institutions and industry will serve as keynote
              speakers.  The  reunions are designed to allow participants to share their 
              experiences in implementing project material into their curricula.   Over a
              two-year period, 900 participant-days are scheduled.  A  compilation of all
              innovations in the chemistry curriculum at  participating institutions
              resulting from the project will be  distributed to all participants.
