Abstract    :
              The Great Lakes Research Consortium (GLRC) proposes to immerse 20  undergraduate
              faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that  demonstrates environmental
              problem-solving as an effective teaching  strategy to stimulate undergraduates'
              interest in environmental  science.  This model has proven to be effective
              during a summer  practicum for undergraduate environmental science teachers of
              two  and four year colleges who, as a result of the practicum,  successfully
              incorporated environmental problem solving curriculum  into their courses. 
              Undergraduate faculty participants learn  environmental analysis techniques and
              prepare environmental impact  statements (EIS) for a hypothetical development
              project in a  contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario.  As they are being exposed
              to  new innovative theoretical concepts and techniques developed by the  Great
              Lakes research community to understand and solve  environmental problems,
              participants are shown how to integrate  environmental problem-solving into
              curricula at their home  institutions.  Special topics, based on the Great
              Lakes experience,  will include the theories and applications of cascading
              trophic  interactions and particle-size spectra in community ecology; 
              analytical methods for determining toxic chemical concentrations in  sediments
              and fishes; and the use of microcomputers for massbalance  and bioenergetics
              modeling of large lake systems.  Through  preparation of environmental impact
              statements for a realistic  project, these techniques will be integrated into
              the overall  environmental analysis and problem-solving approach that has 
              stimulated undergraduate interest in science at two GLRC campuses  for a
              decade.  Participants in the practicum will return to their  home institutions
              with expanded and updated professional skills and  new strategies, methods and
              techniques for improving undergraduate  education and addressing environmental
              problems in local  communities.
