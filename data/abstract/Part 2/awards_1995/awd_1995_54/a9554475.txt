Abstract    :
              This project continues the "NSF-catalyzed Innovations in the  Undergraduate
              Chemistry Laboratory" symposium at the fall 1996,  1997, and 1998 national
              meetings of the American Chemical Society.  Since 1985, the National Science
              Foundation's College Science  Instrumentation Program (CSIP) and the
              Instructional Laboratory  Instrumentation (ILI) program have made possible a
              wide variety of  instructional improvement projects in chemistry.  Since 1987,
              a  symposium "NSF-Catalyzed Innovations in the Undergraduate Chemistry 
              Laboratory" has been held at each fall national meeting of the  American
              Chemical Society.  This event has become well-established,  and each year twice
              the number of abstracts required for an all-day  session are submitted. 
              Attendance at the 1994 symposium varied  from 20 to 71 persons during the day. 
              The Program Officer Chair of  the ACS Division of Chemical Education has agreed
              to include this  event in the CHED program at the 1996-98 fall ACS meetings.
              These  events have been held in order to improve the understanding of the 
              purposes of this NSF program, and in order to dissemilate the  results of some
              of the best projects.
