Abstract    :
              9554462    The Council of Chief State School Officers proposes to collect and
              report additional  information about mathematics and science education from
              each state.  The organization has  received NSF support since 1989 to design,
              develop, and report on state by state  differences in elementary and secondary
              teacher and student participation in mathematics  and science courses and
              published reports in 1991, 1993, and1995.  This proposal would  conduct data
              collection and analysis for another year. It would also analyze current state 
              curriculum frameworks, develop state indicators and report trends in science
              and  mathematics education, conduct research on new measures of the enacted
              curriculum and disse  minate indicators in published reports.
