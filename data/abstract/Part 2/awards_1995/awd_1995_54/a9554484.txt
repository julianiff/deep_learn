Abstract    :
              9554484  The city of San Antonio incorporates 15 districts that enroll 239,000
              students.  Of these, nine have agreed to forge a partnership they believe will
              create a greater capacity to raise the quality of education for the children
              they serve.  To improve achievement of all students in mathematics and science,
              they will work together to accomplish three strategic goals:    Improve the
              quality of teaching through site-based, teacher-customized professional
              development.  Make schools the centers of planning and actions to improve the
              quality of teaching and learning.  Attain city-wide coordination to align
              policies, resources, and practices that establish high expectations and equal
              opportunities in mathematics and science for all students.    The San Antonio
              Urban Systemic Initiative's conceptual model expands on the three strategies; 
              suggesting the elements of the model as a reform hypothesis.  Summed up, it
              implies that students will succeed in school if:  student programs are
              enriched; curriculum content is coordinated; partnerships with business,
              community, and other stakeholders are established; parents are involved;
              planning is site-based; community action is strengthened; teacher quality is
              improved; and policies are aligned to support implementation and operation of
              the USI plan.  Undergirding these strategies is the formation of a unified
              multi-district thrust.  ***
