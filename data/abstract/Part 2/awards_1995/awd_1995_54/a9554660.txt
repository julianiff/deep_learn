Abstract    :
              This project provides a 2 week workshop focusing on parallel  processing for
              faculty from institutions with limited parallel  computing equipment.  It also
              includes a follow-through activities  during the following academic year.  The
              workshop covers material  on how to design and write parallel programs,
              parallel computer  architectures, techniques for integrating parallel computing
              into  computer science courses,and methods and materials for teaching  parallel
              processing to UG students.  The workshop includes a  significant laboratory
              portion in which participants will have the  opportunity to write, analyze, and
              compare parallel programs for  various parallel computers and simulators. many
              of the lab  activities will be assignments that have been successfully used 
              with students.  a portion of the workshop will be devoted to the  design of a
              parallel processing unit or course to be implemented  during the academic year
              following the workshop.  As part of the  workshop, 4 participants from prior
              parallel processing workshops  at Illinois State University, will present the
              work that they have  done with UG students in parallel processing. 
              Follow-through  activities will include an interactive forum during following 
              forum, in which past participants will talk about their work.   Dissemination
              will occur at annual national CS forums.
