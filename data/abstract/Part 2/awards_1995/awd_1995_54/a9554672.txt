Abstract    :
              This proposal is building on BMCC's successful NSF Undergraduate  Faculty
              Enhancement program.  The project is providing summer  workshops for
              mathematics faculty which emphasize students working  in groups and use of
              computer graphers and computer algebra systems  to create written honors
              projects and animated calculus movies. The  student population at BMCC is
              two-thirds women, and eighty-five  percent African-American and Latino.  With
              support from NSF, DOE,  and MSIP, they have been highly successful in
              attracting and  retaining increased numbers of women and minority students into
              our  Precalculus, Calculus, and Differential Equations sequence.  The  new
              workshops are adding new techniques in technology and  collaborative learning
              to the workshops which includes science  projects developed through their
              NSF-CCD grant, CD-ROM technology,  and two 1-day academic year workshops each
              year. Physics and  chemistry faculty are attending the workshops as well as 
              mathematics faculty.  The project is sharing what is learned and  developed
              with other faculty in the region by instituting two  regional summer faculty
              workshops for each of two summers.  One  workshop is for faculty inexperienced
              in technology on the  preparation of collaborative computer portfolios in
              Science and the  Calculus sequence.  The second workshop is for faculty more 
              experienced in technology.  Two 1-day academic year workshops each  year are
              for follow-up activities.
