Abstract    :
              With the advent of sophisticated computer algebra systems,  increased speed and
              memory, and the Internet, the computer has  become essential for many
              mathematicians not only in their research  but also in their teaching.  This
              week long workshop, which will be  held on the DePauw University campus, will
              focus on computing in  the undergraduate curriculum for students studying
              geometry and  abstract algebra.  The  schedule of the workshop will include 
              lecture/demonstrations, hands-on workshops, short courses and  informal
              discussions.  The staff of the workshop will include  leaders in the use of
              technology in these areas.  A World Wide Web  site will be maintained to
              exchange ideas on the theme of the  workshop.  New course materials will be
              developed by some of the  participants, anticipated for initial distribution in
              the fall of  1997.
