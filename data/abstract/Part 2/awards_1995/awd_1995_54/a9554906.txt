Abstract    :
              Application modules in the form of projects and active  learning techniques to
              provide a strong foundation in the  principles of chemical measurement and to
              pique the interest  of both chemistry majors and non-majors will be developed 
              for use in introductory analytical courses. The modules will  address an
              analytical problem drawn from current research in  biological, environmental or
              materials science. Students  will be responsible for proposing and evaluating
              analytical  protocols to solve the problems: they will conduct workshops  and
              design their own laboratory experiments. A  multidisciplinary Advisory Council
              will guide the PIs in  problem selection and module development. A two-week
              faculty  workshop will provide training in the use of these modules.  A World
              Wide Web home page will be used to distribute  information about the modules
              and will allow users to share  experiences using them. Modules will ultimately
              be  distributed by a commercial publisher.
