Abstract    :
              9554609  Purks    CHATTAHOOCHEE SYSTEMIC INITIATIVE PLANNING PROPOSAL    A
              collaborative of local educational agencies, higher education, business and
              industry, professional organizations of teachers, and Chambers of Commerce in a
              65-mile radius of Columbus, Georgia, will engage in a twelve-month planning
              process leading to a teacher enhancement proposal for K-8 mathematics and
              science teachers.  The project, which   plans cooperation with the Georgia SSI,
              targets 10-25 school districts in Georgia and Alabama.   The planning partners
              will assess resources, establish a foundation of collaboration among
              participating educational and community agencies, and plan a comprehensive,
              systemic initiative that provides for teacher enhancement in mathematics and
              science.    Cost-sharing by planning partners is 78% of the NSF-requested
              amount.
