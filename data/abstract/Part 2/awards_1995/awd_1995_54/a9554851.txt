Abstract    :
              Project NATURE is a collaborative research experience involving undergraduate
              students in an introductory biology  course.  The focus of their research will
              be on problems and solutions related to the restoration of natural areas, in 
              particular, prairie restoration.  The project is unique in that it shares the
              knowledge and biological products (seeds and  plants) produced by undergraduate
              students with teachers and students in schools and private citizens interested
              in  preserving and restoring prairies.    About 900 students per year, for the
              next several years, will be conducting research on seed germination, seedling
              and  juvenile plant survivorship, and the mortality and survival of vegetative
              and flowering plants, as well as, the  relationship between plant weight and
              seed set.  This life history approach to the conservation of plant species is 
              currently viewed by ecologists as an important way to guide recovery efforts
              for rare and declining plant populations.    This 5-week collaborative research
              experience in an introductory biology course will show students that they too
              can  contribute to the restoration of natural areas, while learning what it
              means to add their own small piece to a body of  scientific knowledge.
