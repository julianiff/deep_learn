Abstract    :
              The current rapid increase in the level of affordable computer  hardware, and
              the ready availability of a variety of -computational  chemistry software
              packages, have made molecular modeling  accessible to all levels of the
              undergraduate curriculum.   Construction and visualization of molecules have
              become valuable  teaching tools, yet many chemical educators have had limited
              or no  experience with this medium.  This three year project will offer 
              college faculty in New England and eastern New York an opportunity  to learn
              about using molecular modeling in their undergraduate  courses.  A three and
              one half day workshop will be held each June  at the University of
              Massachusetts, with a follow-up symposium to  be held in January. Participants
              will gain familiarity with the  basic theory and practical use of molecular
              mechanics and  semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations and will receive a
               brief introduction to ab-initio methods.  The emphasis of the  workshop will
              be on the use of these techniques to teach and learn  undergraduate chemistry. 
              We will further advise the participants  in establishing computational
              chemistry programs at their home  institutions.  During January participants
              and local educators from  the Five-College region will be invited to the
              University to  exchange success stories and discuss methods of incorporating 
              modeling into undergraduate courses.
