Abstract    :
              The National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT) will develop a  program to
              disseminate the effective and innovative strategies for  teaching geoscience
              that have been developed over the last decade.   The two-year program has four
              components:  1) three one-day short  courses on effective teaching offered each
              year at meetings of  professional geoscience societies; 2) one annual four-day
              summer  workshop on re-designing an introductory or upper-level geoscience 
              course in the context of educational reform; 3) opportunities for  continuing
              discussions among participants via an electronic list  server and "alumni"
              reunions at meetings of professional geoscience  societies; and 4) a Teaching
              Resource Book of successful and  innovative strategies for teaching geoscience
              to undergraduates.   The audience for this project will include faculty members
              at a  variety of types of institutions as well as graduate students and 
              post-doctoral fellows.  The short courses and workshops will  introduce
              participants to teaching techniques that promote active  learning, stimulate
              them to look critically at design of effective  learning environments, and
              provide opportunities for discussions  about teaching.  The presenters are five
              experienced faculty  members who will actively involve participants in the
              session.   Participants will leave a short course or workshop informed not 
              only about the value of making changes in how they teach, but also  about
              specific teaching strategies and examples of assignments.
