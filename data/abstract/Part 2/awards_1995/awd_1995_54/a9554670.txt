Abstract    :
              A one week workshop on introductory FT-NMR is being held for twelve  faculty
              members. These faculty come from two and four year  institutions in a seven
              state region including Arkansas, Oklahoma,  Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,
              Illinois, and Iowa.  Special efforts  are being made to recruit women and
              minority participants.  The  workshop consists of lectures, instrument use, and
              data analysis.   Topics covered range from introductory NMR theory to pulse 
              sequences and 2-D NMR.  Participants use a JOEL 270 MHZ FT-NMR,  purchased with
              NSF-ILI support, to obtain proton, carbon-13,  phosphorous-31, DEPT, COSY,
              HETCOR, and other spectra.  Each  participant receives a handbook containing
              theory, spectra, and  specific NMR applications suitable for use in
              undergraduate  laboratories. The participants gain an expanded knowledge of
              modern  NMR techniques and are encouraged to introduce these techniques  into
              the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  A follow-up meeting  will be held at
              the midwest Regional ACS meeting, November 1996.   Participants reports on the
              use of information from this workshop  at their institutions will be collected,
              edited, published and  distributed to all institutions of higher education in
              the seven  state region.
