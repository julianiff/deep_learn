Abstract    :
              9554614  Turchin    This Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement
              initiative  is a collaborative effort among Community School Districts 3 and 5 
              in New York City; The Workshop Center at City College; Education  Development
              Center, Inc.; Science Institution Teacher Enhancement  Collaborative;
              Colgate-Palmolive; the New York City Urban systemic  Initiative; and teh New
              York State Systemic Initiative.  Classrooms  will be transformed into active
              learning centers characterized by  involved children working together in
              cooperative groups.  Teachers  will be using the Sustained.  Comprehensive
              professional  development will encourage staff to take risks and assume new
              roles  as they move from a didactic instructional methodology to one that 
              promotes and rewards inquiry-based learning.  The project will  involve all
              1,470 pre-K through grade 6 teachers in the 35  elementary schools of the two
              districts.  These teachers wil be  implementing a science program made up of
              Insights and Science and  Technology for Children units that were piloted
              during the planning  grant that preceded this award.  The approach to
              mathematics will  parallel the science teaching and will stress
              problem-solving,  mathematical reasoning, real world applications,
              communication  about mathematics, integration of mathematical topics, and the
              use  of manipulatives and technology.    The cost sharing for the project will
              be 263% of the NSF award.
