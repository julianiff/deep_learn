Abstract    :
                  9554163  Thier    The proposed 39-month project (starting on 1 April 1996)
              will implement the Chemicals, Health, Environment, and Me (CHEM) project in ten
              school districts.  The CHEM project is part of the Science Education for Public
              Understanding Program (SEPUP) of the Lawrence Hall of Science.  The proposed
              project will combine summer leadership conferences for teacher-leaders and
              in-district project-run experiences for other teachers that will serve 630
              teachers and 10 school administrators and 37,000 students from ten school
              districts.  The project will provide three years of ongoing support and
              leadership training in issue-oriented elementary science to each partner school
              district.  The continuous in-district assistance by the local science mentors,
              the trained teacher-leaders, and the project staff, together with the
              commitment of the local administration, will establish the climate and
              infrastructure required to improve science education in each of the partner
              school districts.  Critical to the long-term success of this effort are:  (1)
              the continuing development of teacher-leaders as agents of change through their
              leadership and their adaptation and design of instructional materials for local
              use and (2) the higher degree to which partner districts adopt or increase
              their commitment to materials-centered science generally and issue-oriented
              science specifically.
