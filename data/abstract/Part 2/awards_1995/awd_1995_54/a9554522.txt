Abstract    :
              GER-9554522  Donoghue  This program will provide broad  graduate training in
              plant  systematics, thereby addressing  widely recognized needs in plant 
              biology and environmental biology.  The Department of Organismic and 
              Evolutionary Biology (OEB) is  ideally suited to provide this  training. Eight
              OEB faculty (three  newly appointed) will be primary  participants in the
              program, along  with five associated personnel from  outside the department.
              New  molecular laboratories complement  the strengths, and growing interest  on
              the part of outstanding  applicants, the development of a  plant systematics
              program has been  hindered by limitations on internal  funding. The program
              will bring  eight new students into the  department and will provide  flexible
              funding for other students  to ensure broad training and timely  completion of
              the PhD. A rotation  scheme and several new courses will  be initiated,
              targeting  morphological and molecular  techniques and the teaching of  plant
              systematics. Harvard will  augment NSF funding by  supplementing tuition and
              providing  field research assistantships,  herbarium traineeships, and 
              resources for the new courses,  workshops, rotations, and  recruitment
              activities. The  participating faculty will allocate  GRT funds to meet these
              goals and  will coordinate efforts to recruit  and retain underrepresented 
              minority students.
