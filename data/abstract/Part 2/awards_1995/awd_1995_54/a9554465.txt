Abstract    :
              9554465  Royster    The Appalachia Rural Systemic Initiative (ARSI), a
              consortium of  education and community stakeholders, seeks to accomplish 
              significant and sustainable improvements in the science and  mathematics
              attainment of students in the Appalachian region shared  by six states. 
              Schools in RSI-eligible counties in Ohio, Kentucky,  West Virginia, North
              Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia will be  partners in Resource Collaboratives,
              coalitions of schools,  community organizations, institutions of higher
              education, and  through telecommunications and internet connectivity,
              information  resources internationally.    Improvement in the instruction
              offered to K-14 students in  participating schools will be accomplished by:   
              providing on-site and ongoing in-service training    leadership and parental
              involvement activities    linking geographically isolated classrooms to
              classrooms,    laboratories, and libraries outside the region    advances in
              the level and quality of science, mathematics and    technology courses taken
              by pre-service teachers in regional    colleges.    ARSI is uniquely positioned
              to capitalize on the extensive  electronic networking plans currently in place
