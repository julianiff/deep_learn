Abstract    :
              This proposal requests partial NSF support for the participation  of Eastern
              Europe scientists, particularly from the FSU  countries, in the 1995 Education
              in Optics conference to be held  in San Diego, California, June 9-10, 1995.   
              The conference will provide a forum for international educators  to exchange
              information about teaching optics.  Session topics  range broadly over the
              field of optics education, from pre-  college to graduate.  Optics education is
              carried out at an  advanced level widely throughout the world, and many of
              those  educators have a great deal to contribute to a better  understanding and
              appreciation of the conference theme.  United  States educators will benefit
              from learning more about the  methods employed in these other programs.
