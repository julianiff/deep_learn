Abstract    :
              9554619  Smith    Three school districts in rural, north-central Mississippi
              will cooperate in a twelve-month planning project to solidify/expand
              partnerships and implement a strategic planning process leading to a Local
              Systemic Change proposal for K-8 mathematics.  The project expects to serve 140
              K-8 mathematics teachers from Winona Public Schools, 75 from Montgomery County
              Schools, and approximately 80 other teachers of mathematics from a third
              neighboring district.  The planning project emphasizes exemplary instructional
              materials, strong support for teachers, involvement of parents and the business
              community, and the creation of alternative schedules that provide weekly
              released half days for teacher professional development.
