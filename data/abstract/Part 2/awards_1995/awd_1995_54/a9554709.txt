Abstract    :
              This project is holding summer workshops to introduce college  mathematics
              instructors to the reform of business calculus using  materials developed by
              the NSF Harvard Calculus Consortium.  The  workshops feature the use of
              graphing calculators and computers,  visits by professors from business,
              alternative pedagogies such as  group learning, and concrete lessons and
              strategies for  participants to take home.  While the reform of engineering 
              calculus for scientists and engineers is making considerable  progress, the
              traditional business calculus has not gotten the same  attention. A regional
              consortium of faculty teaching these  materials is being formed to help enhance
              the teaching of busiless  calculus throughout the area.  Follow-up activities
              are occurring  at sectional MAA meetings. Two-year college faculty from Truckee
               Meadows Community College are involved with the teaching and  organizing of
              the workshops.
