Abstract    :
              Basham  95-54344    Support is requested for initial implementation phases of
              the Navajo Learning Network (NLN), a four-part project with the overall
              objective of establishing a single virtual campus linking all educational
              institutions within the Navajo Nation. Teaching, research and curriculum
              development activities will be carried out collaboratively by K12 as well as
              NCC faculty and students. A base level of connectivity between participating
              institutions will be accomplished utilizing the wide-area network developed by
              the Navajo Nation government that will connect participating Navajo Nation K-12
              schools to Navajo Community College's system and out to the Internet. The
              Navajo Learning Network project team, together with trainers from the Los
              Alamos National Laboratory, will provide training both on NLN and Internet
              access, and will work closely with NCC and K-12 faculty to develop a effective
              strategies for utilizing information technology as a teaching and learning tool
              in a way that is sensitive to the learning styles prevalent among Navajo
              schoolchildren.    The planned information technology upgrade is necessary to
              provide expanded education and support services to the entire NCC campus
              system, and ultimately to all residents of the Navajo Nation, an area of
              approximately the size of West Virginia (25,000 square miles), covering
              portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Currently, over 200,000 Navajos live
              on or near the reservation.
