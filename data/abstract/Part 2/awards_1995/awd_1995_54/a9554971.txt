Abstract    :
                    This  project  will  develop a new introductory  course  in  textile 
              science.  It will introduce students to  the  innovative  technological 
              aspects of this discipline  through  a  discovery-  oriented   approach  to 
              product  development  and  manufacturing  processes.   Besides  applying  the 
              principles  of  science  and  engineering to successful business products,
              legal, marketing and  environmental   aspects  necessary  to  the  realization 
               of   a  successful product will be covered.  Through the use of  hands-on 
              investigative  techniques, a research and design  team  approach,  field  trips
               to manufacturing facilities, lectures  by  industry  experts,  and 
              discussions of patents  and  other  legal  issues,  students  will be
              introduced to an industry that needs  graduates  in science and engineering.
