Abstract    :
              9554161  Pennypacker    This proposal, sponsored by the Lawrence-Berkeley
              Laboratory of the  University of California-Berkeley, seeks funding for a three
              year  project to teach teachers how to use computer based imaging  techniques
              in their classrooms to bring about deeper understanding  of science concepts. 
              Called Hands-On Universe the program uses a  comprehensive set of curriculum
              units, developed under an NSF  Instructional Materials award, which emphasizes
              the understanding  of basic concepts in astronomy and the math and science
              underlying  those concepts.  The program uses a combination of real time 
              astronomical images as well as stored images.  Topics include study  of
              astronomical measurements (size, distance and brightness),  determination of
              the characteristics of satellite and binary  systems and searching for
              supernovae.  Local resource teams  consisting of highly trained teachers,
              museum personnel and local  scientists will provide workshops and support for
              teachers  implementing the program in their region.  The target sites are the 
              state of California, and the cities of Chicago, Illinois and  Nashville,
              Tennessee.  The project also has a pilot project  component which prepares and
              tests the effectiveness of modules at  the Middle School level.  At the end of
              three years each site will  have worked with 238 teachers.  A total of 714
              teachers will be  enhanced by the project.  The matching funds, in support of
              the NSF  award, are about 26% of the NSF grant amount.
