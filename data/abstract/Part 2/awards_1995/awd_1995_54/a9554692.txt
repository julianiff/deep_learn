Abstract    :
              This  proposed focuses on a two year series of summer  workshops,  with  an 
              evaluation  period, in Scientific Visualization.  These  workshops  are 
              scheduled for the summers of 1996 and  1997.  The  workshops  are  jointly
              sponsored by NSF  and  the  ACM  SIGGRAPH  education  committee. The co-PIs
              have successfully conducted  CCD  and  workshops in Computer Graphics,
              sponsored by  the  NSF.  The  workshops  have 3 separate objectives: provide
              participants  with  working   knowledge  of  scientific  visualization,  to  
              produce  curriculum materials, and to bring participants into an awareness  of 
              this  emerging discipline.  The concept for  these  workshops  builds  on 
              previous  foundation work done  by  the  professional  societies.   The 
              utility of these workshops  will  be  evaluated  after  the participants have
              had a chance to integrated this  new  knowledge  and curricular material within
              their own CS  programs,  by  formal  follow up by the PI. The results of  this 
              evaluation  will be reported to the community.    The   PIs   intend   to 
              actively  pursue  minority   and   women  participation   in   all  workshops. 
               They  have   linked   with  individuals  and  institutions at HBCUs  that 
              have  interest  in  participating in the workshops.
