Abstract    :
              An electronic database will be developed for a variety of weather  conditions
              for use as laboratory exercises in atmospheric science  courses at all levels. 
              Exercises will emphasize problem-solving  skills, and students will engage
              modern analytical techniques that  are appropriately applied to each case
              history.  A namual will  accompany the datasets to provide instructions for
              accessing the  data, with suggested exercises that can be used to demonstrate 
              applications of the datasets.  Materials will be developed for  different
              levels of instruction from introductory classes for non-  majors to upper
              division courses in synoptic meteorology, weather  forecasting and dynamics. 
              These exercises will allow students to  explore atmospheric structures and
              processes with ease and detail  not previously possible and will enhance their
              understanding of the  three dimensional evolution of complex weather systems. 
              These  materials will be made available through production of CD-ROMs  and/or 8
              mm exabyte tapes.
