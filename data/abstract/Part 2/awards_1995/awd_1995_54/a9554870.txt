Abstract    :
              Recent concerns over problems in American science education  have prompted rapid
              development of new educational methods  and technologies.  Traditional modes of
              information sharing,  however, haven't been successful in producing widespread 
              educational reform--overcoming the inertia of instructors  remains a
              significant obstacle.  To encourage  adoption of  educational innovations, we
              intend to widely disseminate  "hands-on" materials, i.e., materials that are
              ready for  immediate use in the classroom.  The twofold goals of this 
              collaborative project are 1) to actively disseminate  information and
              materials, and 2) to encourage discourse  across disciplines and institutions. 
              We intend to exploit recent advances in information  technology to establish a
              World Wide Web server devoted  solely to achieving the above goals.  To begin
              with, we will  place on-line physics and chemistry materials developed with 
              previous NSF support.  These materials, which have proven to  be highly
              effective in enhancing student learning and  interest in introductory college
              physics and chemistry  courses, will be available for immediate classroom use. 
              In  addition to the active dissemination of these materials, the  server will
              solicit user contributions, enriching the pool  of ideas for all users. 
              Initially focused on physics and  chemistry, the contents of the server will
              later be expanded  to other disciplines.  With input from users and an advisory
               board we will establish policies for the most effective use  of the  Web site.
               By reaching a broad audience this project  will encourage the evaluation and
              adoption of shared  material and thus help produce a broad and lasting change.
