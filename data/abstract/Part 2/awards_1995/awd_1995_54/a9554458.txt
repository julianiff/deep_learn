Abstract    :
              9554458      The project will conduct a regional self-study to determine optimum
               strategies to accomplish systemic educational reform and economic  development
              in a region characterized by high poverty and lack of  resources.  The
              principal investigator has established a coalition  among American Indian
              education centers, tribal education boards,  reservations, state agencies and
              NSF systemic initiatives in the  region that includes California, Nevada and
              Arizona.  The  development phase will result in an implementation plan that 
              addresses the barriers faced by American Indian students in the  region, and
              capitalizes on opportunities to create community based  support for equitable
              access to science, mathematics, engineering  and technology education.  The
              strategies employed will include  local, regional and multi-State conferences,
              bringing together the  key education and community stakeholders.  ***
