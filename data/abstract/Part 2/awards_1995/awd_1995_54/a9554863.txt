Abstract    :
              The PI proposes extensive revision and restructuring  of an  existing simulation
              course designed primarily for senior  computer science majors by:  1)
              developing an integrated set  of laboratory exercises using commercially
              available  software (GPSS/H);  2) incorporating these materials into a  formal
              laboratory manual along with related computer science  reference materials and
              instructions in the use of the  software; 3) implementing a pilot course using
              this manual  together with a single text in the theory of simulation; 4) 
              evaluating the new course by collecting and analyzing  feedback from students
              and faculty; 5) preparing a syllabus  and a detailed annotated course outline
              for the instructor,  keyed to the manual and the text; and 6) dissemination of 
              the prepared materials.  The materials developed will be  flexible and highly
              modular allowing their adoption or  adaptation at other institutions.  This
              project will be undertaken at the University of the  District of Columbia
              (UDC), a university whose student body  is 89% minority.  The instructional
              materials are designed  to be especially helpful to computer science students
              by  providing them with marketable skills in computer simulation  which can be
              expected to enhance their ability to obtain  professional positions with a
              bachelor's degree.
