Abstract    :
              9554168  McLaren    This four-year project, sponsored by the National Center for
               Atmospheric Research, teaches those teachers, primarily from grades  6-8, in
              seven selected rural school districts in Western Colorado,  the basic concepts
              of atmospheric science.  The project will start  out first with the district
              outreach component.  Then in the next  years of funding the project will bring
              35 teachers (five from each  district) for three consecutive three-week summer
              workshops for  intensive content, pedagogical and leadership training.  The 
              workshops will increase the teachers' knowledge of the atmospheric  sciences
              and mathematics, enable them to develop aativity-based  teaching strategies,
              show them how to use current educational  technologies, increase their
              leadership skills and provide them  with laboratory and field experiences as
              they work with NCAR  scientists.  During the school year these teams of lead
              teachers  will work with 21 teachers in their district (for a total of 182)  to
              implement atmospheric science in the schools.  These lead  teachers will be
              aided by NCAR scientists, instructors from  Colorado's Science Discovery
              Program and the Annenberg/CPB Internet  training program.  The atmospheric
              science curriculum will be based  upon the materials developed by the original
              Project LEARN program  and includes modules entitled Atmospheric Dynamics,
              Ozone in Our  Atmosphere and Cycles of the Earth and Atmosphere.    Matching
              funds account for 51% of the NSF award.
