Abstract    :
              The project is continuing to develop a series of laboratory modules for the
              introductory astronomy laboratory.  The modules address a pressing need for
              modernization:  though astronomy is a very popular course for undergraduates,
              and for many their first and only college experience in science, laboratories
              in astronomy have difficulty providing needed hands-on experience because of
              the faintness of astronomical objects, the inconvenient time scale of many
              phenomena, and the fickleness of weather.  In the past, most exercises
              available to astronomy instructors relied on analysis of photographs or canned
              data, and exemplified techniques that were increasingly out-of-date.     The
              current project, Contemporary Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA), has
              already developed 7 Windows and Mac exercises, and will complete at least 3
              more by 1996.  Each module consists of software, student guides, teachers'
              manuals, and technical documentation.  The material  has been introduced into
              classes at Gettysburg College and distributed widely.  CLEA software is
              currently at use throughout all the United States and 40 foreign countries,
              reaching at least 10,000 students per year.  Four CLEA exercises won the 1994
              COMPUTERS IN PHYSICS educational software prize.    The current project is
              continuing to develop modules and evaluating the effectiveness of modules on
              student learning.
