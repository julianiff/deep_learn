Abstract    :
              9554607  Jones    The Roanoke River Valley Consortium consists of five
              improverished  school systems with student populations that are predominantly 
              People of Color: Bertie, 78%; Hertford 73%; Northampton, 79%;  Warren, 77%;
              Wedon City, 98%.  The vision is to provide science,  mathematics and technology
              professional development for K-8  teachers.  This will enable teachers to
              implement changes designed  to increase opportunities for student achievement. 
              This program  will enable teachers to integrate exemplary curriculum materials 
              into North Carolina's curriculum in science, mathematics, and  technology.  The
              planning grant will allow the school community to  become familiar with such
              materials as Science and Technology for  Children, Middle School Science and
              Technology, Windows on  Mathematics, Windows on Science, Jasper Woodbury Series
              and Bob  Moses Algebra Project.  Approximately 528 teachers and 30 schools 
              will participate in this project.
