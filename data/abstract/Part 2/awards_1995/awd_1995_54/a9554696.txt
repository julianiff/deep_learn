Abstract    :
              "Enhancement of Faculty Design Capabilities" proposes a series of  design
              education workshops and a National Conference on Engineering  Design and Design
              Education.  The two-week summer workshops, to be  held in 1996 and 1997 at
              Southern Methodist University, are offered  for all engineering disciplines and
              faculty that intend to or are  presently teaching design in engineering courses
              to undergraduate  students.  The workshops strive to address needs of faculty
              from  two-year and four-year institutions who teach non-design, or  engineering
              science, courses and desire to include design into the  course work.  Topics
              addressed in the workshops include design  methodologies, design content,
              design constraints, design tools,  and teaching design through a multifaceted
              format using lectures,  laboratory sessions, discussion sessions, and
              industrial tours.   Participants will develop a design plan, design problems,
              design  projects, and design case studies while working individually, in 
              single-discipline teams, and in multi-discipline teams.  Faculty  leaving the
              workshop will have a design plan, design materials for  courses, a plan of
              implementation at the home institution, ald a  network of design faculty with
              whom to interact.  These workshops  will guide faculty to a different way of
              thinking, a freshened  approach to processes and procedures of design
              synthesis.  It is  anticipated that the National Conference on Engineering
              Design and  Design Education to be held in Spring, 1997 will mark the creation 
              of a continuing forum for exchange of ideas between engineers and  educators on
              engineering design and design education which can be  continued on a two-year
              cycle.
