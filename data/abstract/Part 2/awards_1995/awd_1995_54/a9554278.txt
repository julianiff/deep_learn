Abstract    :
              PI:  Williamson  95-54278    WhaleNet is a unique interdisciplinary, hands-on,
              collaborative telecomputing project  to foster excitement and learning about
              the natural world in schools across the nation and  around the world. Through
              interaction with cooperating international scientists and research 
              institutions, students will be able to participate in research projects on the
              marine ecosystem  and have access to data from a variety of research programs,
              including studies on marine  mammals, pollution, and general environmental
              sciences.      WhaleNet Program Goals:      to utilize telecommunications and
              other advanced technologies to enhance education through cooperation and
              communication among students, teachers, scientists, and research institutions; 
                to involve students in real-time interdisciplinary scientific research and
              education by sharing data collected from classroom field experiences, existing
              research programs, and new research projects by participating organizations
              using high technology devices;    to establish collaboration among business,
              education, and research institutions, with the goal of enhancing student
              involvement and interest in learning and environment;    to establish an
              international network of schools, students, educators and scientists who are
              interested in integrating WhaleNet into the K-12 curriculum as an
              interdisciplinary resource;    to connect students to a variety of research
              databases, students to scientists/naturalists, and students to students via
              telecommunication to stimulate interest in and involve students in
              interdisciplinary learning;    to make related supplementary curriculum
              materials available to educators electronically, utilizing a gopher server,
              listserv, and world wide-web connectivity.      The proposed project builds
              upon the success of WhaleNet - Interdisciplinary Curriculum Planning Grant
              (RED-9454757), which has been active throughout the academic year September 1,
              1994 to August 31, 1995. As a result of this planning grant, WhaleNet  has
              expanded to include participants from all 50 states and 28 countries. With
              continued funding students and educators will have access to scientists as well
              as past and current data so that they can experience a more comprehensive
              academic program on a year-round basis. WhaleNet continues to establish
              contacts among educators, students, scientists, and research programs to
              enhance K - 12 science education. Interdisciplinary K-12 teaching units and
              innovative, interactive CD-ROM materials are being produced so they can be used
              with the WhaleNet program. WhaleNet enables students to use research data and
              information in real-time to generate involvement and interest in scientific
              investigations while fostering an interdisciplinary approach to learning,
              research, critical thinking, and problem solving.
