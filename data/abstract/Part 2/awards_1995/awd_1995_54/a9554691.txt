Abstract    :
              The University of South Alabama will conduct during the summers of  1996 and
              1997 a series of four four-day hands-on workshops for two  and four-year
              college faculty on the appropriate use of the Texas  Instruments TI-85 and
              TI-92 graphics calculators in collegiate  mathematics.  Two of the workshops
              will take place during the  Summer of 1996 and two will be scheduled for the
              Summer of 1997.   The purpose of the workshops is to engage participants in 
              developing an intellectual framework for the appropriate use of the  graphing
              calculator in the study and teaching of precalculus,  calculus, differential
              equations, matrix theory and elementary  statistics. This will be accomplished
              both by having participants  work through material developed by the PIs and
              also by having  participants create their own materials. Upon completion of one
              of  these workshops participants will be able to:  1) make appropriate  use of
              the graphing calculator, and address the technical and  pedagogical issues such
              usage involves; 2) return to their home  institutions and take the lead in the
              appropriate introduction of  the graphing calculator into their curricula; and
              3) help build a  coalition between two and four-year institutions so as to
              foster a  more coordinated effort in the teaching of collegiate mathematics 
              courses.
