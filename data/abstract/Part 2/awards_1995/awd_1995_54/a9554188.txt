Abstract    :
              9554188  Austin  This project will determine how transactional writing, i.e.,
              writing used to develop,  construct and express mathematical understanding,
              effects females' achievement in,  and attitude toward, their college and middle
              school mathematics classes.  The project  will target three different groups of
              student participants in the basic and intermediate  college algebra sequence,
              as well as in one group of participants in a three-year middle  school
              mathematics sequence.  College level achievement will be measured by the 
              Elementary Algebra Skills test; the Stanford Achievement Test will measure 
              achievement on the middle school level.  Attitude toward math will be measured
              by  the Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale.    Teams of mathematics and English
              faculty investigators, and their female students,  from a large, urban two-year
              college and participating middle schools from a large,  urban public school
              system will create an academic community through the use of the  college's
              electronic bulletin board. The project will intervene at the two critical
              points  that hinder girls staying with and succeeding at mathematics and hence,
              women  successfully pursing mathematics-based careers and reaching higher
              income levels:  lack of achievement and poor attitude. Transactional writing
              can be an instrument in  the construction of knowledge and the reshaping of
              beliefs.    Writing about math helps students more easily learn mathematical
              concepts.  Students  from middle schools and a community college will use a
              technique called transactional  writing to make them active learners. This,
              along with mentoring and career  counseling, will help them become more
              interesting in math and science careers.  ***
