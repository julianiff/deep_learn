Abstract    :
              9554608  Cuoco    This project is increasing meaningful dialogue among research
              mathematicians, mathematics educators, and high school teachers concerning the
              role of high school mathematics in preparing students for life in a
              technological society and for careers.  A primary focus is what is often
              perceived to be a dichotomy between preparing the next generation of engineers,
              scientists, and mathematicians and providing the mathematics education needed
              to prepare all students for citizenship and for careers.  Dialogue is taking
              place through an initial series of articles and interviews in the news
              publications of several of the mathematics professional organizations an
              invitational conference in the Washington, DC area, and follow-up sessions at
              meetings of the mathematics professional organizations.
