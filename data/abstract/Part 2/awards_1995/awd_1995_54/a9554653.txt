Abstract    :
              The University of South alabama and Tuskegee University will  conduct 2
              workshops to train 20 faculty from two and four year  institutions to use a
              cognitive-based approach to curriculum  development, as applied to Introductory
              Computer Science Courses."   This project will act as a major dissemination of
              the results of a  previously awarded CCD.  The 1st week long workshop will be
              held  during the summer 1996, consisting of 3 major activities. First,  the
              participants will study the cognitive based process using: the  Bloom taxonomy
              (levels of learning), Bruner's spiral approach to  earning, Soloway's problem
              solving heuristics and code templates,  collaborative learning in structured
              labs (as described by Webb),  and system theory to provide frequent feedback
              and control of this  learning process.  The second activity will be to use this
               knowledge to study the materials developed from the CCD project.   After the
              needed background has been developed, application to  curriculum issues will be
              covered.  The third and final activity  will be the use of this material to
              develop similar material for  the participants home institution.  As follow-up,
              2 forums will be  used; a suitable national forum (eg. SIGCSE-97), and a
              weekend  workshop to beheld at Tuskegee University in the Spring 1997.  The 
              participants for these workshops will be selected from  applications, received
              as a result of public announcements.  Every  attempt will be made to select
              faculty from diverse institutions,  and to include a minimum of 25%
              participation from HBCUs.
