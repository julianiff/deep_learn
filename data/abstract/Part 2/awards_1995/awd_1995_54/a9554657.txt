Abstract    :
              This project promotes a way to encourage undergraduate work on  "real-world"
              problems culled from sources outside the academic  environment. Funds will
              support a workshop/symposium on  undergraduate consultancy programs to bring
              together those with  experience in consultancy programs, those who wish to
              start such  programs, and representatives from industry, business, and 
              government. Not only is there growing evidence of the educational  merit of
              such activity, but it has the added advantage of tying  more closely the
              non-academic world with the world of undergraduate  mathematics.  This fosters
              a greater appreciation of the role which  mathematics plays in solving problems
              which routinely arise in  situations where the applicability of mathematics is
              not fully  understood. This workshop will take an important first step in 
              extending the opportunity offered by consultancy work, in a  curricular
              context, to a much wider population of undergraduates.   Until now, only large
              institutions with the in-house resources to  support such programs could offer
              them.  Creating organizational  infrastructure and taking advantage of
              electronic communication are  required, and are available, to open up the
              opportunities of a  vital research-like activity to small colleges and
              universities  with limited resources.
