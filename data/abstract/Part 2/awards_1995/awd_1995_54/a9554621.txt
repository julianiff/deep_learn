Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is holding a series  of regional
              workshops for mathematicians who teach statistics but  have little formal
              training in the subject.  These workshops  provide participants first-hand
              experiences of active learning  strategies by which undergraduates can
              investigate elements of  statistical thinking.  Follow-up activities will
              support the  workshop participants as they form a community, linked by 
              electronic mail, in which they share ideas about teaching  statistics.  These
              workshops will introduce participants to:  1)  the nature of statistical
              thinking, particularly concentrating on  how statistical concepts and methods
              differ from mathematical ones;  2) hands-on activities through which students
              can participate  actively in their discovery and understanding of statistical 
              concepts and properties; 3) assessment practices which go beyond  testing and
              grading to establish a dialogue between students and  instructor that leads to
              both improved teaching and a more  authentic assessment of students'
              understanding of statistics and  data analysis; 4) technology not simply as a
              tool for analyzing  data but also as a vehicle for active learning and as a
              resource  for acquiring teaching materials.
