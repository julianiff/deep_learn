Abstract    :
              9554605  Ackerman    This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a
              partnership  that demonstrates broad community involvement for the reform of 
              science education-Support and expertise is drawn from business,  industry, the
              mayor's office, the school district and academia.    The project will initiate
              a hands-on science program in all 70  elementary schools in the Seattle school
              district, which is urban  and multiethnic.    Approximately 1400 elementary
              teachers in the program will receive  more than 100 hours of professional
              development in small groups  which will be led by skilled resource teachers and
              practicing  scientists.  Teachers will select instructional materials from 
              FOSS, Insights and Science and Technology for Children.  The first  summer the
              teachers will receive one week of in-depth immersion in  kit activities. 
              During the following school year teachers will  receive 2 full day and 4 half
              day inservice presentations by  resource teachers.  Resource teachers and the
              scientists will be  available on a continuing basis for classroom visits and 
              consultations.  The formal "training" will be completed during a  second summer
              institute.    The award is $4,200,000 for 5 years with cost sharing estimated
              as  $3,864,316.
