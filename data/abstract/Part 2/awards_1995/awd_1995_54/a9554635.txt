Abstract    :
              Mineralogy is the inaugural course in the geoscience curriculum,  but typically
              presents major obstacles to learning, and may not be  relevant to the
              contemporary needs of students or society-at-large.   This training workshop is
              designed to develop a variety of  hands-on, discovery-oriented laboratory
              exercises.  The goals of  the workshop are to develop new materials to make
              mineralogy more  accessible and relevant to our students, and to develop these 
              exercises in accord with modern learning theory.  Five different  types of
              learning activities are included: field experiences, "dry  labs" (mineral
              identification, crystal  structures), "wet labs"  (experimental exercises such
              as crystal growing), analytical  exercises (using XRD and SEM), and
              computer-assisted learning  (modelling programs).  Selected workers present
              model activities at  the workshop; the other participants rotate through 16-20
              of these  new lab exercises at the workshop.  All participants develop at 
              least one new exercise, and these are to be field tested at the  home
              institutions during the following semester.  These exercises  will be compiled
              and submitted for publication by the Mineralogical  Society of America.  The
              product of this workshop will be a core of  instructors trained in new
              instructional methods and materials, and  a laboratory workbook of new
              exercises that may be used by all  students in the geosciences.
