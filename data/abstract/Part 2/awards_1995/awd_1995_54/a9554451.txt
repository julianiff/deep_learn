Abstract    :
              9554451   Johnson      Syracuse University will initiate a 4-week, summer
              residential, Young Scholars project in interdisciplinary   science and
              mathematics for 50 economically disadvantaged students from New York State
              entering grade   8.  The program will provide high ability and high potential
              middle school student with early experiences   in mathematical problem solving,
              laboratory science, computer science, and research in a highly charged  
              environment.  The summer component combines course work with extensive
              laboratory and research   experience, and includes field trips designed to
              increase students' interest and awareness of research career   paths.  Academic
              year follow-up activities include an extension of activities and research in
              which the   students were involved during the summer.
