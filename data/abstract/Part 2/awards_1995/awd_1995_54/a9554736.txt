Abstract    :
              Mathematics is undergoing remarkable advances, the scope of  mathematical
              applications is broadening into new disciplines,  reaching a more diverse
              student population.  Courses and other  educational experiences for prospective
              mathematics teachers at all  levels provide an important wedge that will help
              bring about this  revolution in the undergraduate curriculum.  Just as many
              current  college faculty are not in a position to infuse contemporary 
              mathematics and its applications into their teaching, many  undergraduates who
              are currently preparing to teach at the  elementary and secondary levels are
              also not sufficiently aware of  important current mathematics.  It is important
              that the presence  of contemporary applications of mathematics be increased in
              the  undergraduate preparation of those who will teach at all levels.   To
              address this opportunity and challenge, workshops are scheduled  for the
              summers of 1996 and 1997.  These workshops will each be of  two-week duration,
              with 25 participants per workshop.  The  workshops in 1996 will be held at
              Virginia Commonwealth University  and the United States Military Academy.  The
              focus of each workshop  will be contemporary applications of mathematics in the
              broadly  defined areas of mathematical modeling, discrete mathematics, and 
              geometry.  They will feature mathematical topics of increasing  emphasis and
              importance.
