Abstract    :
                   This project is based on the premise that for many learners,  statistical
              concepts can be conveyed visually and that  computers  can  be  used  in  new 
              ways  to motivate,  interest  and  engage  students.  Learning  modules  will
              be  developed  that  use  high  quality  color  computer  graphics  to  help 
              learners  visualize  statistical   concepts  at  the  level  of  a   second  
              semester  introductory statistics class. Each learning module will  consist  of
               computer software, student learning exercises, and instructor  notes.  The
              software will be used by instructors to support  them  in  teaching  concepts 
              and by students  to  reinforce  classroom  instruction  by  active 
              self-discovery  learning.  The  software  modules  will  enhance deductive
              learning and  promote  inductive  learning through experimentation using
              scenarios, animation,  and  real  data.  Modules  will  use easily created 
              data  with  known  characteristics  or real, relevant databases.  Written 
              exercises  will involve students in active learning by posing questions that 
              students  must investigate using the software modules.   Students  who   use 
              the  proposed  learning  modules  should:  have   more  confidence  in  using
              statistical techniques and computers;  have  strengthened  belief  in  the
              importance of  statistics;  perform  better  on defined learning tasks; and be
              more adept at  critical  thinking and original problem-solving.
