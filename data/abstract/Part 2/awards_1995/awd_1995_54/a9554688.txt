Abstract    :
              The purpose is to provide a workshop to transfer knowledge  regarding the
              economics of engineering design to all engineering  faculty who teach
              design-intensive courses.  This knowledge was  gained, in part, from a
              three-year, multi-disciplinary, multi-  institutional National Science
              Foundation research grant  entitled, "Integration of Economic Principles with
              Design in the  Engineering Science Component of the Undergraduate Curriculum" 
              (DUE-9155917).  Multimedia based software and extensive course  notebooks will
              be distributed to each workshop participant.  This faculty workshop will be
              presented two times and will be  complemented by a one-day workshop in which
              the participants will  report on their success in implementing workshop
              materials in  courses taught at their home institutions.
