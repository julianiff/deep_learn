Abstract    :
              Undergraduate Fiber Optics and Communications for Engineering  Technology is
              designed to introduce 30 faculty members from  community and undergraduate
              colleges to this expanding technology.   Two one-week seminars/workshops are
              planned for June 1996.  The  program is a collaborative effort involving three
              community  colleges in the Boston, MA area and one four-year technical 
              college.  During the first week, 15 faculty will be offered 40  hours of
              training, half of which will be in the fiber optic  laboratory at Wentworth
              Institute of Technology, and the remaining  20 hours will consist of lectures,
              simulation and analysis using  computers.  Involvement by industry is integral
              to the program.   The laboratory exercises allow participants to handle optical
               fibers and a number of specialized instrumentation and test  equipment
              developed specifically for fiber optics.  The basics,  uses, and applications
              of fiber optics will be emphasized,  especially as they relate to engineering
              technology education at  the two- and four-year level.  In the selection
              process, women,  minorities and those faculty who intend to introduce/enhance
              fiber  optic instruction at their home institutions will receive priority.   No
              prior knowledge of fiber optics or communications technology is  required.  A
              follow-up one-week session is proposed for the summer  of 1997.
