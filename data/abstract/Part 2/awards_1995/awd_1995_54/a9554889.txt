Abstract    :
              The Distance and Service-Learning Project at Virginia Tech  is a partnership
              between the University's Physics Department  and science programs at high
              schools throughout Southwest  Virginia.  The Project targets two related
              problems:  the  geographic and professional isolation of rural high schools 
              and teachers that limits their access to the facilities,  resources and
              research discoveries of major universities,  and the academic isolation of
              advanced  undergraduate and  graduate science students who have little or no
              opportunity  to communicate with populations outside of their highly 
              specialized scientific field.  The Project design addresses  these problems by
              employing distance learning to stimulate  high school students' interest in and
              appreciation of rapid  developments in the fields of physics  and astronomy;
              and  service-learning to engage selected physics students in the  delivery of
              this information through ongoing electronic and  face-to-face interactions. 
              The Project will be piloted with  Floyd County High School.  It is expected
              that the Distance  and Service-Learning Project will increase the level of 
              science literacy among the general population of students at  Floyd County High
              School, lead to the creation of an  Advanced Placement Physics course, improve
              the oral, written  and electronic communication skills of physics majors at 
              Virginia Tech, and introduce physics majors to new  applications of their
              discipline, including careers in  teaching.  All phases of the Project Pilot
              will be carefully  documented, leading to the production of a teaching guide 
              for School-College Collaborations using Distance and Service-  Learning
              techniques.
