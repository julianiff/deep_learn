Abstract    :
              The Chautauqua program provides an annual series of workshops in  which scholars
              at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering  meet intensively for
              several days with undergraduate college  science teachers.  These workshops
              provide an opportunity for  invited scholars to communicate new knowledge,
              concepts, and  techniques directly to college teachers in ways which are 
              immediately beneficial to their teaching.  The primary aim is to  enable
              undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep current and  relevant.  This
              program is national in scope and will immediately  benefit large numbers of
              college faculty (7,500 participants over  three years) who in turn positively
              influence more than 1,000,000  undergraduates.  This program which has impact
              on the quality of  undergraduate programs in both two- and four-year
              institutions is  an essential element in attracting and maintaining an adequate
               supply of graduates in science, mathematics and engineering.  The  program
              follows the recommendation of the National Science Board  that the Foundation
              use highly leveraged program support to address  the serious national problems
              in undergraduate education.  The  project is 1/3 supported by NSF.
