Abstract    :
              A workshop focusing on the process for initiation, management and  assessment of
              significant curriculum changes within undergraduate  engineering programs will
              be presented.  Participants will be  provided with (1) lessons learned
              elsewhere and (2) plans and  guidance for how to implement curriculum changes
              in their own  schools.  There have been numerous forums and workshops
              developing  prescriptions for curriculum changes, and a general consensus has 
              emerged that substantial changes are needed in many programs.   However,
              reforming engineering curricula has proven difficult  except for occasional
              courses with existing programs.  This  workshop is not intended to prescribe
              necessary changes, but to  focus on how to achieve such changes:  how to insure
              faculty "buy-  in", how to assess budgetary impacts, how to organize
              committees,  etc.  Participation will be sought from a broad range of 
              engineering schools.  The workshop will be held at Carnegie Mellon  University
              in June, 1996, and the written materials developed for  the workshop and
              subsequently emerging will be available in written  form and via the World Wide
              Web.
