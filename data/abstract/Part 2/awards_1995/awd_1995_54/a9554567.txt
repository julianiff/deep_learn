Abstract    :
              GER-9554567  Flournoy    The Chemistry and Statistics  Departments of the
              American  University (TAU), located in the  nation's capital, plan to recruit 
              five doctoral students with  potential for superior  accomplishments to study
              chemistry  and statistics and develop an  interdisciplinary environmental 
              research program in the Fall of  1996. We propose to use the  flexibility that
              is available  within the existing requirements  for a PhD in Statistics
              effectively  to initiate a new interdisciplinary  PhD program. The proposed
              training  program focuses on several issues  that involve statistics and 
              chemistry. It is expected that the  students will pursue a career in  teaching
              or research with an  environmental emphasis in academia,  industry or
              government at the  completion of their program. The  students will be recruited
               nationwide, through a special  brochure discussing the program,  with special
              attention to  recruiting talented students for  traditionally underrepresented 
              groups in chemistry - women and  minorities. In addition a focus of  the
              recruitment will be for  students with BS degrees who are  working at
              environmental  laboratories and remedial  contractors and who have been out  of
              school a few years to attract  them back to graduate school as  full-time
              students in an  interdisciplinary program focused  on Environmental
              Chemometrics.
