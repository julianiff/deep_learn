Abstract    :
              NMR Concepts is offering two workshops each summer for three years.   The
              workshops will improve the ability of undergraduate faculty to  teach NMR
              courses and to conduct research.  Each workshop will  consist of lectures,
              laboratory sessions, and problem solving  sessions.  There will also be keynote
              speakers and classroom  presentations by the participants.  The workshops end
              with round  table discussions to aid the participants in incorporating their 
              new knowledge into their courses and research efforts.  The first  workshop,
              NMR Concepts and Operating Techniques, presents the  physical concepts of NMR
              and includes spectrometer operation, the  Fourier transform, quadrature phase
              detection, data treatment,  relaxation measurements, and NOEs. The second
              workshop,  Intermediate and Advanced Interpretation of 1D and Basic 
              Interpretation of 2D NMR Spectra, reviews the general features of  proton and
              carbon spectra and then treats the use of relaxation  time measurements, proton
              decoupling procedures, NOE, and some  multinuclear NMR.  The keynote speakers
              will be selected from  academia with a focus on how they have integrated NMR
              into their  curriculum and how they use it in their research.  Participants 
              will be expected to share through a variety of means instructional  materials
              that they develop as a result of their participation in  the workshop.
