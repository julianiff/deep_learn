Abstract    :
              The American Association of Physics Teachers proposes to improve  undergraduate
              education by conducting workshops for 100 new physics  faculty members
              primarily from the research universities.  This  workshop will cover new
              developments in physics curriculum and  pedagogy, especially those that have
              resulted from NSF-sponsored  projects.  Participants will be selected from
              physics departments  at research universities from throughout the U.S.  Topics
              to be  highlighted include active learning and interactive lectures, 
              addressing conceptual misunderstandings, using technology, minority  and gender
              issues, developing and funding innovation, physics as a  liberal art, mentoring
              research students, training the next  generation, and precollege outreach
              activities.  Follow-up  activities will include an electronic network and a
              session devoted  to the new faculty workshop at the annual meeting of the AAPT.
