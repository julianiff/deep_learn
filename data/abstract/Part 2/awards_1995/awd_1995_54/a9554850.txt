Abstract    :
              Symmetry  has  played  a  ubiquitous  role  in  our  civilization  throughout
              all ages.  Mankind has been fascinated by the inherent  beauty  of  symmetry in
              nature and has explored and searched  for  understanding its implications in
              his culture. This preoccupation  with  symmetry has led to discovery of rich
              mathematical theories  to  explain  and  apply  symmetry in a vast  number  of 
              subjects  ranging  from  anthropology and the arts to engineering  and  the 
              sciences.   This project proposes to use symmetry  and  geometric  methods  in
              the sciences, the arts and engineering as a theme  to  develop  topic-oriented
              course-modules that  can  be  adapted  in  revitalizing  undergraduate
              education in  mathematics  and  other  subjects.   It  is proposed to expose
              and explore some  of  these  theories   in   their  context  of  discovery  and
               applications,  constantly  drawing attention to the quantitative and
              qualitative  geometric methods that accompany the intuitive reasoning.  It  is 
              reasonable to expect that a number of students will be  attracted  to 
              engineering,  mathematics  and  the  sciences  through  their  experience with
              such material.  The proposed lab portion  of  the  course-modules intends to
              get the students involved  hands-on  in  exploring modern and advanced topics
              that are inaccessible in the  present  linearly  ordered college curriculum, 
              especially  those  that  requires prerequisites from several mathematics and
              science  courses.
