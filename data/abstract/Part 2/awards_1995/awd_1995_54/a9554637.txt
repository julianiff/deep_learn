Abstract    :
              Radford University will host a five-day conference for  approximately 55-60
              college biology teachers.  The focus is  introductory biology courses for
              majors and non-majors.  The  primary objectives of the conference are
              threefold.  First, it will  serve as a forum for presenting curricular
              innovations in biology  teaching, including the ones developed with NSF support
              at Radford  University. Participants will have extended opportunities to 
              explore these new approaches through hands-on workshops, group  discussions,
              and critiques.  As a result, the conference will  promote adaptation and
              adoption of model activities that have  proven successful at various colleges
              and universities around the  country.  Second, the conference will provide a
              forum for  participants to share their own laboratory and classroom 
              activities.  This will be accomplished through poster sessions,  group
              discussions, and collaborative work sessions.  Finally, the  conference will
              provide a vehicle for establishing and  strengthening informal information
              networks linking committed  biology teachers throughout the country.  Using
              conference  activities as a springboard, participants will contribute to a 
              volume of new teaching materials.  This informal publication will  be
              distributed to all conference participants and other interested  biology
              teachers.
