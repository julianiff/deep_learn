Abstract    :
              An integrated, interdisciplinary  curriculum is proposed to actively engage
              students in the scientific process.  A three course sequence consisting of
              "Mathematics and Inquiry", "Science and Inquiry", and "Undergraduate Research",
              will be required of all non-science majors.   The goals of this curriculum are
              to foster an understanding of the process of science and to develop an
              awareness of the interconnections between  science disciplines and the natural
              world.  Classes will be team taught by physical and life scientists, using
              case-studies to explore real world issues through open-ended laboratories and
              small group projects.  The undergraduate research course  is the most
              challenging part of this proposal, and  will require all students to engage the
              scientific process through participation in on-going research  projects, or
              through design and implementation of a research project. Teaching science by
              engaging all students in the scientific process could revolutionize the way we
              educate non-science majors,  meeting the  national goals of producing  more
              scientifically literate graduates, and empowering them to confront the  complex
              social and scientific problems of the 21st century.
