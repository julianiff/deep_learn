Abstract    :
              This proposal involves the offering of a program for facilitating  and enhancing
              the teaching in engineering and technology of the  relatively new fields of
              fiber optic sensors and smart structures.   This program is intended to give
              undergraduate faculty a chance to  explore these technologies where teaching
              loads and institutional  resources have prevented such exploration in the past.
               The goals  of the program are:  1) to introduce primarily undergraduate 
              faculty members in the various engineering and technology  disciplines to these
              technologies through both discussion and  practice, 2) to allow these faculty
              to consider and discuss how to  include the study of these technologies in
              their courses and  laboratories, and 3) to collect and distribute participants'
               experiences in the teaching of these technologies.  Theory,  application, and
              hands-on exposure will be provided during the  workshop, with specific
              attention paid to sensors of major interest  in engineering, such as
              force/strain sensors, gyroscopes,  electromagnetic sensors and chemical
              sensors.  The program consists  of a series of participation events; a summer
              workshop wherein the  technologies will be introduced both technically and in
              terms of  educational applications; enhanced interaction over the following 
              year among the participants for the exchange of ideas and  preliminary results;
              and a follow-up workshop for the exchanges of  experiences of program
              participants, as well as updates on the  technologies.  In addition, formal
              dissemination of results will be  achieved through appropriate publications and
              workshop  presentations.
