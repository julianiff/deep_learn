Abstract    :
              9554467  Belgarde        This proposal is to fund the High Plains Rural Systemic
               Initiative (HPRSI). The Turtle Mountain Community College is  serving as the
              fiscal agent for a coalition of 17 tribally  controlled colleges in a
              five-state region of the Upper Great  Plains that includes Montana, Nebraska,
              North Dakota, South  Dakota, and Wyoming.    The initiative has four major
              components: 1) Reservation  Initiatives, that will establish a process to
              increase the native  cultural knowledge and content into the science and
              mathematics  curriculum; 2) Technology Development, to promote the development 
              and use of technology as a teaching tool by establishing networks  across the
              region; 3) Partnership Development, to increase the  connections between RSI
              school and all interested stakeholders;  and 4) Commissioned Studies, a special
              initiative to support the  Reservation Initiatives component by providing
              teachers and  faculty members an opportunity to research and develop viable 
              teaching models for tying science and mathematics education to  culturally
              appropriate materials and methodologies for systemic  change.    The
              Reservation Initiatives component and the Commissioned  Studies are viewed as
              the "seedbed" to begin the process of  change at each of the 18 sites involved
              in the HPRSI (17  colleges, plus 1 reservation in Wyoming that is not served by
              a  college). It is important to acknowledge the differences among  these tribal
              communities, yet there are themes that provide a  common ground in their
              approach to educational reform, such as:  understanding the cultural behaviors
              in children and adults in  order to facilitate a higher level of learning;
              knowledge and  understanding of Native/indigenous knowledge in science, 
              mathematics and technology; acknowledging and utilizing the  wisdom and
              knowledge of native elders and other cultural  expertise to promote the
              integration of the cultural knowledge  base into a challenging science and
              mathematics.    The High Plains Rural Systemic Initiati ve will promote
              systemic  change in its five-state region by providing program  coordination,
              staff support, and program assessment that takes  into account both science,
              mathematics, and technology subject  matter and the cultural knowledge of the
              respective tribal group.    During the first year the HPRSI will sponsor six
              Reservation  Initiatives at the Sinte Gleska University, South Dakota, Dull 
              Knife College, Montana; Nebraska Indian College, Nebraska; Turtle  Mountain
              Community College, North Dakota; and the Wind River  Reservation in Wyoming. 
              The activities will improve curriculum  and instruction for science and
              mathematics in grades K-14 in  collaboration with comprehensive initiatives in
              the 5 states;  including the AMP program at Montana State University; the 
              Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota SSIs; and other reform  initiatives.
