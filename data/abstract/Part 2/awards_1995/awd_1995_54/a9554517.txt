Abstract    :
              9554517  Sameh  This proposal outlines a plan for  recruiting and training a set
              of  high-quality graduate students  focusing on the important area of 
              information discovery on the  information super-highway through  human
              interface design for access  to computers and networked  information.  The plan
              builds upon  faculty excellence in this area to  create a focused program of 
              research that will make Minnesota a  leader in this emerging area.  The  plan
              also contains several  inlovative components that will  ensure that we can
              recruit top-  quality students, including women  and students of color, who are
               currently severely underrepresented  in computer science. And, it  provides a
              complete graduate  experience for these students  including industrial
              internships,  training and practice in teaching,  and a supportive, mentored 
              environment.  At its completion,  this program will produce PhDs that  are
              fully capable of becoming  productive faculty members at  research universities
              and top-  ranked colleges.  In the process, we hope to  establish a pipeline
              bringing the  best graduates from Howard  University and Vassar College to  the
              University of Minnesota for  graduate degree.
