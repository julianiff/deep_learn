                Computing    Title:  Technology in Teaching and Research:  A Look at Private 
              Education in Appalachia         Technology in Teaching and Research is an
              ambitious, long-  range project designed to unite the efforts of faculty in
              private  colleges across the Appalachian region to strengthen their use of 
              technology in the undergraduate curriculum.       The first step in the
              project, A Look at Private Education in  Appalachia, is to determine what
              technology is currently in place  and how faculty are using it in their
              classrooms, both for  instruction and research.       The study is expected to
              show that while many of the  Appalachian colleges and faculty are seriously
              lacking in the  resources necessary to employ technology to strengthen their 
              instruction, in far more cases the colleges and their faculty are  on the edge
              of excellence in their access to and use of technology.   At the end of the
              study, a college or faculty member will be able  to examine itself or himself
              in view of what is happening at like  institutions.  The college will be able
              to determine what is  necessary to strengthen its competitive edge in
              recruiting and  maintaining students, and the faculty will be able to identify 
              other faculty across the region who share their interest or who can  strengthen
              their knowledge and skills.       The final report documenting the results of
              the study will be  available for dissemination to colleges across the nation
              who may  also want to prepare for the 21st century.
