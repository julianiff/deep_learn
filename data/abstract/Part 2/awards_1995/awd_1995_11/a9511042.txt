Abstract    :
              9511042  Eagleson  This research will investigate early forebrain development in
              the  vertebrate. The animal to be used was chosen because a mutation  found
              within this species directly affects forebrain and eye  development, and this
              mutation provides a negative condition  whereby development is disrupted. 
              Using normal and mutant  organisms, a detailed forebrain fate map will be
              produced with  fluorescent labeling techniques.  A comparison of the mutant 
              and normal embryo neural plate brain fates will test  whether, and when,
              specific midline early neural plate tissue is  defective in the mutant embryos.
               Using in situ hybridization  techniques, stage by stage gene expression
              changes in forebrain  specific genes will be followed in normal and mutant
              embryos. These  studies will test to see if differences in the timing or amount
              of  forebrain specific gene expression occurs in mutant and normal  embryos,
              and if gene expression events can be related to the  specific forebrain
              defects.  Additional studies will test how the  mutant condition might alter
              later axon growth and neural  connections. These studies will follow axon and
              synapse development  in normal and mutant embryos by using immunocytochemistry
              for a  protein that is formed in developing neurons. These studies will  reveal
              how a single mutant gene can result in defects that manifest  themselves much
              later in development. In addition these studies  will provide a developmental
              framework and model for further  studies investigating vertebrate neural
              development.
