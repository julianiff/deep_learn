Abstract    :
              9511869  Day  Some estimates state that as much as one third of the mammalian 
              genome, some 30,000 genes, are expressed in the brain, but only a  very small
              number have been assigned clearly defined roles in  neural development or
              function.   Increasing our knowledge of the  genes involved in synapse
              formation and stability is fundamental to  our understanding of neural
              development, learning, and memory.    The major goal of this research is to
              identify genes with roles in  the compensatory synaptic reorganization that
              occurs after surgical  alteration of the adult brain.  The studies to be
              performed will  identify changes in neuronal messenger RNAs induced by cutting 
              neural connections to the hippocampus, a region involved in  learning and
              memory.   Molecular cloning will then be used to  identify genes with increased
              activity during the brain's attempt  to compensate for the loss of these
              hippocampal connections.  The  cloning strategy involves subtraction
              hybridization of  complementary DNA libraries constructed from brains having
              two  different types of hippocampal alterations.  The complementary  nature of
              these cloning strategies will remove gene products  associated with the
              non-specific effects, and enrich the resulting  cDNA library with
              synapse-specific neuronal clones.   Careful  screening of these candidate
              clones will determine their roles in  synapse formation and stability.   This
              research will identify  specific genes that are involved in neural development
              and  regeneration and, ultimately, define the role of these genes in  these
              fundamental neural processes.
