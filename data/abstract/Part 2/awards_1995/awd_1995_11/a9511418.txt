Abstract    :
              This award is to hold a conference focusing on how the Great  Depression has
              affected the conduct of public policy.  In  particular, the conference will
              offer papers on the impact of the  Great Depression on trends in the conduct of
              monetary policy,  fiscal stabilization policy, the relative magnitude of state
              and  local versus federal spending, government involvement in insuring  and
              regulating labor markets, and international economic  relations.  The
              conference papers will be published as   conference volume which will be of
              interest both to academic  researchers as well policy makers interested in
              economic policy  matters.
