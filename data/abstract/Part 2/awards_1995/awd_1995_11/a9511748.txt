Abstract    :
               This study is designed to complete a three-city comparison of selection bias in
              the coverage of protests and demonstrations.   It compares a state capitol in
              the United States with one in Germany and with the national capitol.  The
              research is tied to theories of social movements and collective action that
              emphasize the interaction among institutionalized and non-institutionalized
              forms of politics.  Those theories give a central place to the role of the mass
              media in spreading the message of protesting groups and shaping evaluations of
              their importance.  The research systematically examines the ways in which the
              mass media report demonstrations and protests compared to information about
              those events from official sources.       The proposed research will contribute
              to theories of democracy that focus on the role of protest in enabling large
              numbers of people to demonstrate their concerns and to persuade others of the
              importance of their cause.  It will also enlarge theories about the role of the
              mass media in spreading news about protest and in both encouraging others to
              take up the cause and to suppress it.  There is also an important
              methodological contribution that will result from its findings about the nature
              and extent of bias in coverage.  These findings will aid researchers who now
              rely on newspaper reports as their primary source of information on protests
              and demonstrations without knowing the directions of bias.
