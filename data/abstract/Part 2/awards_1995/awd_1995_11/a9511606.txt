Abstract    :
              SBR-9511606  John O'Loughlin  University of Colorado    The Transition to
              Democracy in Ukraine: State Building, Ethnic Mobilization and Adjustments to a
              Market Economy    The principal concern of the research is the roles of the
              politically elite and of strong ethnic majorities in the state-formation
              process.  The research investigates the organization and effects of  political
              campaigns (defined as "intensive efforts by leadership circles to step up their
              control over resources in order to achieve ambitious aims") by the leadership
              of newly independent Ukraine, in the face of ethnic-territorial divisions. 
              Specifically, interviews with political elites, archival data on public
              protest, socio-economic data, and election-results analysis will be used to
              uncover the influences and role of ethnic Russians in the Donbass region
              (eastern Ukraine) in support of or opposition to the new regime.  The
              geographic dimensions of the research entail the relationship between political
              processes at the sub-state (oblast) and national-state scales, the role of
              ethnic-territorial fragmentation in the building of a nation-state, and the
              influence of the Russia-Ukraine border on economic and political events in this
              eastern-most region of Ukraine.  The project should provide a
              political-geographic perspective on the development of (or failure to develop)
              a democratic institutions at the sub-national and national scales, including
              the influences of ethnic territoriality and the multiple implications of a
              national border on institutional development.
