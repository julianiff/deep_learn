Abstract    :
              9511999  Meadows       This grant supports research in elementary-particle 
              physics by two faculty members, a postdoctoral research  associate and 3
              graduate students.  They study the  properties of charm particles, analyzing
              data from an  experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and  one
              planned to be done at the Stanford Linear Accelerator  Center.  For the latter
              they contribute to detector  instrumentation development and fabrication
              preparing for  experimental operations in two or three years.  They also  are
              developing reconstruction and analysis software.  ***
