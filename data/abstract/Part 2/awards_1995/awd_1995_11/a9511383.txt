Abstract    :
              Martin Feldstein  SBR-9511383    The NBER Summer Institute brings together
              economists from  universities, government, and international organizations for
              a  few days or weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences and  collaborative
              research.  The 1994 Summer Institute included 677  economists from 171
              universities and nonacademic institutions, of  whom 58% were not affiliated
              with the NBER.  A similar number of  economists from a large number of
              institutions is expected to  attend this summer.  Special efforts were made to
              include younger  economists and economists not affiliated with the NBER.    The
              Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists  to work closely
              with others for extended and intense periods of  research.  The Summer
              Institute lasts long enough to allow  serious collaboration among economists
              from different  institutions.  While research nearing completion is presented, 
              emphasis is placed on "workshop" aspects of the program, where  new ideas are
              raised, preliminary research ideas are developed,  and plans for joint or
              coordinated research are established.    The Summer Institute is organized into
              twelve programs or areas  of study, including:  economic fluctuations, economic
              history,  monetary economics, corporate finance, asset pricing, industrial 
              organization, health and aging, international studies, labor  studies,
              productivity and taxation.  Each program has its own  group of participants and
              its own group structure.  Although  there is considerable variations among the
              programs, a typical  program will last from one to three weeks, with time
              allowed  during the day for research.  Programs may include a variety of 
              subjects or they may be organized around specific topics.
