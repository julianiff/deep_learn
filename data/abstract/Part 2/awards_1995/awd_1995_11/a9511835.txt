Abstract    :
               This study looks at Progressive-era conflict over education and educational
              policy in four states to answer questions about when, and how effectively,
              disadvantaged groups mobilize to influence the state.  It draws on existing
              theories on social movements, the state, group conflict, and educational reform
              to develop new theories for explain the processes by which subordinate groups
              acquire concerns about education and the means to pressure the state to adopt
              their policy objectives.  Critical attention is paid to formal organizations
              that mobilize individuals and present group demands and to the local and state
              structures that provide opportunities for influencing policy.  The study is
              based on an historical analysis of four states, selected to vary on key
              attributes of race, ethnicity, and nativity as well as in organizational and
              state resources.   %%%   The research will advance our knowledge of how
              individuals, although disadvantaged  because of their position in the
              community, may be able to have political influence when they become part of
              organizations.  It moves beyond the usual perspective of educational sociology
              with an expanded theory on the role of organizations in providing resources,
              shaping demands, and expressing group interests.  Through attention to
              historical detail, it will spell out the processes of change and illuminate the
              ways in which institutions are built.
