Abstract    :
              IBN-9511077  Truman, James W.      The brain contains a myriad of substances
              with the potential to be  used as chemical messengers between cells.  One class
              of messenger  molecules are small protein-like substances called neuropeptides.
                These messengers can function in communication between cells where  their
              release is a local event or in situations where they are  carried great
              distances and act as hormones.  The target tissues,  either local or distant,
              contain recognition sites for these  substances, which then use secondary
              systems to transmit the signal  into the cell, thereby altering its level of
              activity.  Altering  the activity of a large population of cells potentially
              changes the  physiology and behavior of the organism.  Dr. Truman isolated and 
              characterized such a peptidergic messenger molecule called eclosion  hormone
              (EH) and has provided preliminary information on the  biological significance
              of this messenger.  In the present studies,  he will investigate the mechanisms
              employed by neurons to generate  second messengers functioning inside the
              neuronal targets for EH.   In addition, because of his past ability to isolate
              the gene  encoding EH, he will use molecular biological tools to generate 
              mutants unable to produce this messenger molecule and study their  behavior. 
              These investigations will further understanding about  the role of
              neuropeptides in the functioning of the nervous system  and the mechanisms used
              by peptides to alter behavior.
