Abstract    :
              IBN-9511423  Brinton, Roberta F.        Learning and memory are complex
              functions that are dependent upon  many brain regions of which the cerebral
              cortex is one of the  principal players.  Growth in the projections emanating
              from  cortical neurons is a structural feature shown to be associated  with
              learning and memory.  In fact, a chemical messenger,  vasopressin has been
              shown to enhance memory functions and numerous  recognition sites have been
              found for vasopressin in the cerebral  cortex.  However, there is little
              functional information on the  role of vasopressin within the cortex.  Dr.
              Brinton will determine  whether activation of vasopressin recognition sites
              leads to an  increase in the growth of nerve cells from the cerebral cortex.  
              Additional studies will determine whether vasopressin modulates the  function
              of critical support cells in the brain, which markedly  influence the growth
              and survival of cortical nerve cells.  These  studies will provide a functional
              basis for understanding how  messenger molecules influence learning and memory
              by altering  cellular physiology in the cortex.
