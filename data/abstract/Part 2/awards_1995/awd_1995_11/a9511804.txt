Abstract    :
              9511804  Steven Bressler    The aim of this research project is to understand
              how different  parts of the brain work together to allow us to move based on 
              what we see.  These scientists are designing sophisticated  computer analysis
              techniques to measure properties of brain  signals that occur when the brain
              must interpret visual patterns  and use the information to make a movement.  In
              previous research  by these investigators, brain waves from the visual and
              motor  parts of the cerebral cortex were found to briefly become aligned  when
              the brain was deciding how to respond to a visual pattern,  suggesting that the
              alignment od wavelike signals in the cortex  is important for brain function. 
              The objectives of this project  are: (1) to observe how the normal brain
              processes visual input  signals and transforms them into motor command signals,
              and (2)  to advance our general understanding of similar large-scale 
              integration problems which arise in many engineering  applications.
