              Goldstein This is a proposal for two workshop/conferences leading to a book on 
              Domestic Politics and International Law.   The conferences will explore the
              inherent links between domestic politics and international law in an era which
              nations have agreed to more binding international commitments and rules far
              more than could be predicted in the Hobbesian  state of nature  that supposedly
              characterizes international relations.  The objective of the conferences will
              be to bring together under a common social science methodology to try to
              enhance systematic understanding of the legalization going on in international
              politics.  The conferences will involve up to 20 scholars from around the
              United States.  The first conference will be exploratory.  The second will
              apply a rigorous research design to book chapter/papers written to the
              conference theme.   ****
