Abstract    :
              This project will investigate a new approach to learning models of dynamical
              systems  for use in advanced reinforcement learning architectures.  It will
              develop a method by which a  reinforcement learning system can learn multiple
              time scale models and use them as the basis for  hierarchical learning and
              planning.  the project(s objectives are to develop the mathematical theory  of
              this approach, to examine its relationship to control theory and to behavioral
              and neural models of  learning, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in a
              number of simulated learning tasks. The  significance of the project for
              engineeirng is that the use of TD models will be major generalization  of RL
              architectures, making them much more widely applicable.  It also has the
              possibility of  establshing the utility of TD modesl for system identification
              in more conventional adaptive control.  The project also has implication for
              our understanding of animal learning able to model indirect and  direct 
              associations and their interactions in a mathematically principled way.  An
              Additinoal impact  of this research will be t o strengthen links between
              engineering, artifical intellegence, and  biological studies of learning,
              thereby contributng to all three areas by facilitating a transfer of  concepts
              and methods.
