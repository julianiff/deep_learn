Abstract    :
                9511410  Grannis    This award provides funds to permit Drs. Paul D. Grannis,
              Department of Physics, State  University of New York at Stony Brook, Hugh E.
              Montgomery, Scientist, Fermilab, and  John Peoples, Director, Fermilab, to
              pursue with Drs. Joo Sang Kang, Department of  Physics, Korea University, Sun
              Kee Kim, Department of Physics, Seoul National University,  and Yeong Mouk
              Park, Department of Physics, Kyeong Seong University, for 24 months, a  program
              of cooperative research on the DO Experiment at the Fermilab antiproton-proton 
              Collider. The DO experiment will study the interactions among fundamental
              constituents of  matter at the highest energy available in the world today,
              seeking to elucidate the basic  structure of matter and forces at the shortest
              distance scales possible.    The DO experiment is a large cooperative project
              involving many U.S. institutions and  scientists from several foreign
              countries, as well.  The PIs hold that the Korean physicists'  expertise with
              particle tracking devices will benefit the DO collaboration in the development 
              of such devices for the DO upgrade.  Thus, the collaborative project is
              beneficial to the U.S.   The collaboration in a world class experimental
              program also will benefit the Korean  physicists and strengthen Korea's
              technical capabilities and infrastructure.  This project is  relevant to the
              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to 
              increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and
              engineers through  the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and
              techniques and through collaboration  on problems of mutual interest and
              benefit.  The present project adds an international  cooperative dimension to
              the PI's ongoing research under NSF Grant No. PHY-9420671.   Korean
              participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering 
              Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
