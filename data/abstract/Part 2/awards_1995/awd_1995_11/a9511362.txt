Abstract    :
                   Processing by the auditory pathway in the brain passes through several
              stages.  In mammals, information from the auditory nerve from the ear is
              transmitted to clusters of nerve cells (neurons) in the brainstem; these
              clusters are called nuclei.  These cells in turn pass their output to the major
              auditory center of the midbrain, called the superior colliculus.  Complex sound
              patterns present a range of important features for the brain to analyze,
              including timing properties that can include duration, and rate of modulation
              of either amplitude or frequency.  Within the brain, networks of nerve cells
              produce excitation and inhibition in particular ways that produce effective
              "filters" to enhance or to eliminate signals with particular timing patterns. 
              This work uses a novel approach of reversible, specific pharmacological
              blockade of individual nuclei.  Such targeted blockade of the brainstem inputs,
              while physiologically recording neuronal activity in the superior colliculus,
              allows a novel way to study how "tuning" for particular dynamic auditory
              properties can arise by combining excitatory and inhibitory inputs.  Results of
              this analysis of auditory circuitry will provide an advance in understanding
              auditory processing, but also will have an impact beyond auditory neuroscience
              to studies of brain circuits in general, and the way in which complex
              information processing can emerge in complex networks.
