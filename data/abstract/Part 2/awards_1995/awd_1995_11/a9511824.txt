Abstract    :
              9511824  Burgdorfer       The project centers around the description of the
              complex  dynamics of atomic systems.  These systems are classically  chaotic,
              although the underlying quantum mechanical description  is regular and
              quasi-periodic.  The critical issue is to explore  this classical/quantum
              correspondence in; 1) the dynamical  evolution of Rydberg states under the
              influence of short laser  pulses, 2) in relativistic H- beams and 30 in
              microscopic  semiconductors.  ***
