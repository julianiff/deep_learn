Abstract    :
              95-11396   Steffensmeier  Crime and violence have pervasive impacts on the
              development of America's human capital.  The development of a scientific
              understanding of the causes and consequences is the central theoretical concern
              o of this project.  It uses a community-level, quantitative methodology to
              investigate the relationships between social capital and patterns of violence. 
              It identifies community risk factors predictive of violence in major American
              cities.  It seeks to compare the structural sources of violence by blacks as
              compared to violence by whites and of juvenile as compared to adult violence,
              to integrate, theoretically, family and school variables in the research, to
              identify direct and indirect effects of structural conditions on violence
              rates, and to examine the effects of change in structural conditions between
              1980 and 1990 on race- and age-specific violence rates.  The project will
              produce a unique and useful data set for secondary analysis by other
              researchers.  %%%%  Crime and violence have pervasive impacts on the
