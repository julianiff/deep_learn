Abstract    :
                The proposed research is directed towards the development of  mathematical and
              computational tools for the geometric  analysis of molecular conformation,
              kinematics and dynamics.  The resulting algorithms and computer programs are
              expected  to be of widespread utility to researchers in many areas of 
              structural chemistry and biochemistry, including  spectroscopists seeking to
              interpret their data in terms of  a precise molecular model, stereochemists who
              need to find  all conformers consistent with a given  bond arrangement, 
              molecular biologists attempting to predict protein and  nucleic acid
              conformation, and theoreticians studying their  dynamics.  The overall approach
              combines established methods  of conformational analysis based on distance
              geometry with  one of the most important tools of modern theoretical  physics:
              Clifford algebra.  In previous publications, we  have shown how distance
              geometry can be understood within  the broader framework of Clifford algebra,
              and how the  Clifford algebra of three-dimensional Euclidian space can be  used
              to solve important problems in modern conformational  analysis.  We have also
              shown how the martix exponential and  related matrix-valued functions can be
              used to compute the  necessary transformations, and have developed efficient 
              algorithms for them.    Specific research activities planned for the award
              period  include: (1) Conformational analysis in four dimensions, (2)  Mobius
              sphere distance geometry, and (3) Kinematics of  internal molecular motions.
