Abstract    :
              9511937    Yngvesson  Adoption can be an important process in building strong
              families and improving the condition of individual deprived children.  This
              study examines the global market processes that have led to a "commodification"
              of poor children and how those processes are worked out in the transnational
              legal arena and in the adoption policies and practices of the United States and
              Sweden.  It does so by investigating the connections between global market
              processes, transnational legal processes, specifically the expansion of formal
              and informal legal ideologies and practices among those handling adoption, and
              local practices and policies surrounding adoption in Sweden and the United
              States.  Its method is ethnographic.  It will contribute to our understanding
              of  how world legal "space" changes and is itself changed by local legal
              culture and practices.  %%%%  Adoption can be an important process in building
