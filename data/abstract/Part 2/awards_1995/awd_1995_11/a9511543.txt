Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to advance the study of public understanding of
              science by analyzing how lay and expert advocates of alternative cancer
              therapies evaluate their  scientific merit in the context of general social
              values.  The project will draw on the science and technology studies and
              cultural and medical anthropology literatures on boundary-work and cultural
              reconstruction.  It will extend those literatures by  examining how an
              anthropology of public understandings of science can be made relevant to issues
              of public policy.  Methodologically, the empirical research will involve two
              phases: a review of public literature and conference presentations, and 
              in-depth, ethnographic interviews with many of the leading figures in the
              alternative cancer therapies movement.  Interviews will cover a wide spectrum
              of views, including some mainstream critics.  They will focus on the scientific
              or technical criteria  used to distinguish good and bad research and therapies,
              and how these criteria are negotiated with general values such as cost,
              availability, side effects and quality of life, and a concern with
              `naturalness.`  The hypothesis is that public discourse in  this area will
              reveal sophisticated understandings of science.  Policy implications for
              analysis include the question of paternalism in funding and regulatory
              procedures and the general problem of democratizing scientific production for
              various areas of scientific research and funding.  Results will be reported to
              the academic community, the alternative cancer community, and the general
              public.
