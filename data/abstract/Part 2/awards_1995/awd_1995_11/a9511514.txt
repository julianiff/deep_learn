Abstract    :
               This is a study of how decisions are made in small groups.  It tests and
              extends a new model of interaction previously developed by one of the
              investigators and already considered an important advance.  The model takes
              into account the effects of status differences among group members and how
              their interaction develops to predict patterns of interaction and the emergence
              of structures of inequality.  The model has the added advantage of taking into
              account the effects of non-participants on outcomes.  Data are collected from
              80 four-person groups that vary in status characteristics.  %%%   The research
              will contribute to a fundamental understanding of how groups reach decisions by
              taking into account the status characteristics that individuals bring to the
              group, their expectations about distributions of power, and the nature of the
              task performed.   Carefully collected data will be prepared to form a data bank
              for other small group researchers.
