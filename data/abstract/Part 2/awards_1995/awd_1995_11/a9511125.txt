Abstract    :
              9511125  Inman and Haughwout    Investment in public infrastructure has become
              one of significant  policy concern.  The two central questions addressed by the
              proposed  research agenda are:         1) Do we have a public infrastructure
              crisis?       2) If so, what government actions, including incentives, can best
                       encourage appropriate types and levels of expenditures on             
                public infrastructure?    First, to address the crisis question, the
              researchers identify the  benefits of public infrastructure investment.  Does
              public structure  investment increase the income of individuals and businesses
              in the  impacted area or not?  The researchers expect that positive benefits 
              from public infrastructure investment will accrue to large urban areas  and
              negative benefits to rural areas.  As a result of these possible  offsetting
              effects, uniform government policies to encourage  infrastructure investment
              will have zero impact on productivity and  income for the country as a whole. 
              If their predictions are  confirmed, government policies need to be carefully
              formulated to  differentiate between large urban and rural areas.  The benefits
              of  public structure infrastructure on individual households are examined,  by
              considering the impact of such investment on housing prices and  local labor
              markets.    Second, the researchers will look at the effect of federal tax and 
              grants policies on state and local public infrastructure expenditures.   Their
              proposed research recognizes that elected-body officials at the  state and
              local level will vote-trade or be willing to favor another  official's program
              in return for support of their own favored program.   An analysis of state and
              local public infrastructure decisions  capturing such behavior will hopefully
              allow for better design of  federal programs.
