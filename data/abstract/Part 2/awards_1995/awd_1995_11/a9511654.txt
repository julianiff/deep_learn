Abstract    :
              9511654  Jones    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Thomas W. Jones,
              Department of Astronomy,  University of Minnesota, to pursue with Professor
              Dongsu Ryu, Department of Astronomy  and Space Science, Chungnam National
              University, for 24 months, a program of cooperative  research on the
              development of a new multi-dimensional computer code for  magnetohydrodynamics
              (MHD) in astrophysics.  The code is designed to solve problems  involving fully
              ionized, magnetized plasmas in astrophysical environments.  The code will be 
              built from an extension to MHD of Harten's "Total Variation Diminishing"
              second-order  accurate scheme for gasdynamics.  A one-dimensional MHD has
              already been developed.  The  objective of the present work is to extend the
              method to mulitdimensional flows and to  improve its performance in some
              important respects.    The initial application will be to the study of the
              nonlinear evolution of unstable boundary  layers, or contact surfaces, inside
              so-called blast waves.  These structures are important  features to understand
              in young supernova remnants, for example, and are also expected to be  modified
              by the presence of magnetic fields. The collaborators are recognized as experts
              in  the field of this research.  This project is relevant to the objectives of
              the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level
              of cooperation between U.S.  and Korean scientists and engineers through the
              exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through
              collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.   Korean
              participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering 
              Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
