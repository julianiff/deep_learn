Abstract    :
              9511577  O'Loughlin    This research investigation uses a political geography 
              perspective to examine the diffusion of democratic norms and  practices across
              time and space.  The study encompasses the  period since the emergence of the
              modern nation-state beginning  with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and covers
              the subsequent  waves of democratization, including the 19th century, 
              decolonialization in the mid-20th century, and the most recent  period of
              democratic transition, starting in the 1980s and  continuing in the mid-1990s. 
              This investigation rejects the  atomistic frameworks that have been used to
              date to study the  diffusion of democracy.  These frameworks have focused
              separately  on globalism, regionalism, and localism.  Rather, the 
              investigators develop and test theoretical propositions that  integrate all
              three levels of scale, yet retain a temporal  dimension.  The approach
              integrates internal political economic  processes, regional political economic
              competition, as well as  the impact and influence of the global political
              economy upon the  spread of democratic norms and practices.  Context sensitive 
              models of this process attuned to the across-space and over-time  variations
              are developed and tested.  Using dynamic cartographic  techniques designed to
              display quantitative information  intuitively, the investigators show how the
              ebbs and flows of  democratic norms have regional and local, as well as global 
              causes.  Using dynamic space-time statistical techniques, the  investigators
              develop parameters to describe this process.  The  objective is a more
              complete, contextually informed model of the  ways in which democratic norms
              and processes have been extended  over time and over space.    This
              investigation will help elaborate how political and economic  changes implicate
              each other at different levels of scale.  It  will also contribute to an
              understanding of what encourages the  development and survival of democratic
              norms and rules in new  contexts.  Importantly, it will al so address the
              debate between  different views of the sources of democracy, integrating each 
              into a contextually sensitive perspective that spans the global,  regional, and
              local scale.  ***
