Abstract    :
              9511540  Fuhr    This two-year award will support U.S.-Ireland cooperative 
              research between Peter L. Fuhr and Brian MacCraith of Dublin  City University,
              Dublin, Ireland.  The objective is to  investigate the use of spectroscopic and
              evanescent wave  sensors to detect the presence  and concentration amounts of 
              hazardous contaminant and corrosive materials in the  environment.  The
              investigator has been involved in the  development of fiber optic sensors
              capable of operating when  embedded inside civil structures.  He proposes to
              use  similar techniques to test a fiber optic evanescent wave  sensor for
              contaminant (or corrosion) monitoring in civil  structures and at construction
              sites.    The project takes advantage of  Irish expertise in the field  of
              evanescent wave sensing.  This is complemented by the  principal investigator's
              experience in fiber optics sensors  incorporating spectroscopic techniques. 
              The project will  advance understanding of the application of fiber optic 
              sensors for monitoring environmental activities.
