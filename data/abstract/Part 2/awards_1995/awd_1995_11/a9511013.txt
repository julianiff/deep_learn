Abstract    :
              9511013  D'Mello  During the development of the vertebrate nervous system, 
              approximately half of the neurons generated die around the time of  birth by a
              process known as programmed cell death (PCD or  apoptosis).  Although leading
              to the massive death of neuronal  populations, this process is necessary for
              the normal development  of the nervous system.  It is now well established that
              PCD is not  restricted to the nervous system, but occurs in virtually all 
              tissue and cell types and represents a fundamental biological  process serving
              to eliminate unwanted or superfluous cells.  A  question of significant
              importance is whether the inappropriate  activation of the apoptotic program
              underlies abnormal neuronal  loss.  The objective of this proposal is to
              understand the  mechanisms controlling PCD in neurons.  More specifically,
              genes  that induce or suppress the death process will be identified.  A  cell
              culture model system using neurons from the vertebrate  cerebellum has
              previously been established will be used to identify  genes that regulate
              neuronal death.  In the long term, these  investigations will provide
              fundamental information concerning the  processes underlying neuronal death
              during development.
