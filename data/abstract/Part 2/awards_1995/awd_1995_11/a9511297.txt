Abstract    :
              9511297  Kucera  Neurotrophins are small protein molecules that are important
              for  the well-being of cells in the brain and spinal cord.  One of these 
              neurotrophins is neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).  This research will examine  how NT-3
              affects the development of a special type of  proprioceptive sensory neuron
              that provides information to the  brain about the position of the body and
              limbs in space.  The  research will be done on genetically altered animals that
              lack the  gene necessary for the assembly of NT-3.  These animals have a very 
              severe movement disorder suggestive of dysfunction of the entire 
              proprioceptive (body position) system.  These animals will be  analyzed using a
              variety of techniques to find out why and how the  neurons become dysfunctional
              in the absence of NT-3.  The study  will generate data concerning how
              neurotrophins aid neurons in the  growth process during development.  Knowledge
              derived from this  work will provide fundamental information about the effects
              of  neurotrophins during the development of the nervous system.
