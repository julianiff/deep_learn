Abstract    :
              9511623  Wang  Lipid-based signaling via the octadecanoid pathway, which leads
              to the formation of regulators such as jasmonic acid, plays an important role
              in plant physiological processes.  Jasmonate and related oxygenated lipids have
              been shown to act as endogenous signals activating defense gene expression and
              regulating growth and development.  Alph-linolenic acid has been shown to be
              the precursor for the synthesis of these regulators.  However, very little is
              known about lipolytic release of alpha-linolenic acid in the octadecanoid
              signaling pathway.  Which lipid hydrolyzing enzyme is activated in the
              signaling process?  Which glycerolipids are hydrolyzed?  How is the hydrolysis
              regulated?  These questions are important because making available the fatty
              acid precursor is an early step in the sequence of events in signal
              transduction and may control the signaling pathway.  The goal of this research
              is, therefore, to investigate the involvement, nature, and regulation of
              deacylation by lipolytic enzymes in the octadecanoid signaling pathway.   
              Stimulus-induced lipid turnover and release of alpha-linolenic acid will be
              investigated in castor bean leaves in response to wounding.  Wounding is chosen
              because it is a well characterized stimulus that induces the jasmonate
              signaling system.  Completion of the proposed work will fill a critical gap in
              our knowledge of the cellular roles of membrane lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes in
              plant growth and environmental responsiveness.
