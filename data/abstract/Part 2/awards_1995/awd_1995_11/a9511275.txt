Abstract    :
              9511275  Stokey    The goal of this research  is to explore some of the links
              between technological change, investments in human and physical capital, and
              the distribution of income.  The first  part of the project is motivated by the
              results of recent empirical work that shows that the degree of
              intergenerational mobility in the income distribution is far lower than earlier
              studies had suggested.   This project will analyze together the important
              channels for the persistence of inequality.  Pervious theoretical models have
              treated these channels one at a time ald neglected altogether one important
              channel.  The goal of this part of the project is to develop a theoretically
              tractable model that can be calibrated to U.S. data.   Understanding the
              mechanisms through which persistence is generated is critical for debates about
              the efficacy of various policy measures in raising the earnings prospects of
              children whose family backgrounds alone give little reason for optimism.  For
              example, to calculate the benefits of increased public expenditures on
              educational investments in children from low-income families, one needs to know
              how much higher investments are likely to raise the child's eventual earnings,
              to what extent higher public expenditures are likely to be offset by lower
              private expenditures, and the extent to which any benefits to the child will
              also affect the child's own descendants.   The second  part of the project is
              motivated by the evidence of a dramatic increase in the wage premium for
              skilled labor in the U.S. in the 1980s due to skill biased technological
              change.  The experience of the 1980s was not unique, however: the U.S. has seen
              several extended periods of expansion and compression in the skill premium
              during this century.    A stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model will be
              used to study such periods of expansion and compression as equilibrium
              responses to stochastic, skill biased, technological change.
