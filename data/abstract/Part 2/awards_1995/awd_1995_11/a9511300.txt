Abstract    :
                   Seasonal cycles of reproduction are regulated by environmental cues of
              light levels, called photic cues.  The eyes are not the only detectors of
              light; many animals also have light sensitivity in the pineal glad within the
              head.  However, in many vertebrates other than mammals, the receptors for these
              regulatory cues are actually light-sensitive cells within the brain itself. 
              These "deep brain photoreceptors" are known to exist, but they have not yet
              been positively localized and identified.  This work will use biochemical,
              electrophysiological and anatomical approaches to localize and identify these
              cells in the brains of birds that show cyclic seasonal breeding.  Specific
              antibody-binding tests can label cells that contain compounds resembling the
              protein opsin, part of a known photopigment.  Electrophysiological recording
              determines the responses of these identified cells to light stimuli.  Electron
              microscopy shows the detailed connections from these cells to nerve cells in
              the hypothalamus controlling hormone secretions.  Results from this study will
              have impact beyond sensory neuroscience, to issues of circadian regulation of
              behavior and the ecological relationship of breeding cycles to environmental
              cues.
