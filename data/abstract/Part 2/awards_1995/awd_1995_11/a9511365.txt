Abstract    :
              9511365  Edward Keller    Saccadic eye movements are among the most rapid and
              accurate  movements that humans are capable of executing, but the  mechanical
              system producing eye movements is relatively simple in  comparison to limb
              movements. Therefore, the saccadic system has  served as a model system for
              gaining insights into the general  problem of how the brain generates motor
              control. This project is  to examine how two-dimensional sensory information
              from the  visual system is turned into the highly distributed neuronal  control
              signals from the brain that move the eyes to produce  highly efficient
              examination of our surroundings, for example,  during reading. These scientists
              will use artificial neural  networks and optimization techniques to model how
              movement  commands are developed in neural structures in the brain such as  the
              nonlinear maps of visual space and maps of the motor space.  Saccades are
              controlled by internal feedback about eye position  during a movement, but not
              direct visual input, because the  visual messages are too slow to provide
              compensation during the  saccade. These scientists are testing their hypothesis
              that  shifts in the populations of active cells in these maps in the  brain are
              driven by the internal feedback signal and actively  control the trajectory of
              the eyes during the movement. Their  work will help us to understand both how
              eye movements and other  kinds of movement, such as fine motor control or human
              gait, are  controlled by the brain.
