Abstract    :
              Non linear interactions of electrostatic waves in a  magnetized plasma are
              studied using a combination of laser  induced fluorescence and modern plasma
              probe techniques.  The research is designed to examine the consequences of 
              chaotic particle orbits on non linear plasma behavior such  as wave mixing and
              flow generation.
