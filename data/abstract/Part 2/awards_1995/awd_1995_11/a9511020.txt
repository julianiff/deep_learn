Abstract    :
              9511020  Adams    Nerve cells communicate with each other by means of chemical 
              signals called neurotransmitters and neurohormones. The arrival  of electrical
              impulses at nerve endings release tiny amounts of  neurotransmitters acting
              locally or much larger amounts of  neurohormones acting at longer distances;
              both stimulate the  electrical activity in neighboring nerve cells. The release
              of  these chemical signals depends on the brief entry of calcium to  nerve
              terminals, a process that is highly regulated by "calcium  channels". Small
              amounts of calcium enter for neurotransmitter  release, whereas larger and
              longer periods of calcium entry are  necessary for the release of hormones.
              These differences are to a  large extent dictated by variations in the
              properties of  different calcium channels. Dr. Adams and his colleagues are 
              working to define the properties of calcium channels in different  types of
              nerve cells, ranging from motoneurons to neuroendocrine  cells, using a
              combination of electrophysiology and pharmacology.  The kinetics of calcium
              channel opening and closing as well as  their sensitivities to different drugs
              and toxins will be used to  classify them into different groups and to
              associated them with  different functions in nerve cells. Potential
              applications of  these studies are the development of pharmaceuticals and pest 
              control agents.
