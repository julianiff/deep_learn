Abstract    :
              9511368  Over the past decade, interest in historical syntax has grown 
              substantially among generative grammarians as it has become clear  that the
              study of successive stages in the historical development  of languages provides
              useful results to the field of comparative  grammar. Historical data adds two
              dimensions to investigations  into the specification of the parameters of
              universal grammar:  (1) the minimal character of the grammatical differences
              between  successive stages in a historical development allows for more 
              controlled comparison than do comparisons of unrelated languages;  (2) the
              sequential order and temporal coincidence of linguistic  changes allows
              hypotheses regarding the correlation of  superficially disparate features to a
              single abstract underlying  property to be tested by the way these features
              appear and  disappear in the historical record.    The nature of historical
              data (surviving texts) requires the use  of a methodology different from that
              of synchronic syntax if it  is to be exploited to its full potential. To this
              end, the  investigators have constructed three corpora, one of Middle  English,
              one of Yiddish, and a smaller one of Early New High  German. In the next period
              of research, they will double in size  the Middle English corpus, taking it
              from its current 510,000 to  1.1 million words. The need for this work is
              created by the wide  range of dialect variation in Middle English and the
              important  syntactic changes which take place in this period. Proper study  of
              this variability requires more and larger text samples than  the current corpus
              contains.    Prior work on the syntax of verb movement and verb complement 
              order in Middle English and Early Yiddish using moderate size  corpora and
              recent theoretical work in West Germanic has opened  up a number of avenues of
              inquiry which the planned research will  address:    1) the historical
              processes by which grammars change, including  the contribution of dialect and
              language contact;    2) the proper analysis  of V2 in Middle English, taking
              into  account dialect data, and the insightful but opposing theories of 
              Pintzuk (1991) and van Kemenade (1992);    3) the comparative grammar of the
              variation between head-initial  and head-final verb phrase structures;    4)
              the potential contribution to the analysis of historical  Germanic of recent
              proposals by Kayne (1993) and Zwart (1993)  regarding the proper grammatical
              treatment of variation in  directionality.
