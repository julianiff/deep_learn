Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to investigate learning and adaptive behavior in economic
              environments.    In particular, the PI hopes to develop game theory in order to
              make it more descriptive of   observed behavior.  The PI has developed a model
              of reinforcement learning which   explains and organizes previously-collected
              data from a variety of strategic   environments.  In addition, the PI has
              designed new experiments to test this model and to   distinguish it from other
              models of economic behavior.
