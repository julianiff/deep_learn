              Proposal Number: IBN-9511895  Principal Investigator:  DeBold, Joseph F.     
              Progesterone is an important steroid hormone for regulating many  aspects of
              physiology and behavior.  According to the classical  approach, steroid
              hormones exert their effects by entering cells,  binding with a receptor inside
              the cell, and then the  steroid-receptor complex acts on  specific sites on the
              chromosomes  to change which proteins that cell is producing.  This mechanism
              of  action has been described in virtually every cell that responds to  steroid
              hormones.  However, it appears to be absent in the ventral  midbrain.  Dr.
              DeBold's previous studies have shown that a form of  progesterone that cannot
              enter neurons is effective in altering  behavior when administered in the
              midbrain but not in other steroid  sensitive areas.  Therefore, the primary
              focus of the proposed  studies is to determine how progesterone is acting on
              neurons to  influence behavior and the connectivity of these neurons.  Dr. 
              DeBold will identify the neurons containing these unique  characteristics by
              labeling progesterone with a fluorescent tag and  identifying the cell to which
              it binds and then using neurochemical  procedures, characterize the type of
              cells containing these novel  receptors.  Using selective pharmacological
              agents, the role of  other neurotransmitters in mediating progesterone actions
              will be  established.  These studies investigate novel effects of steroid 
              hormones and will be extremely beneficial in understanding the  physiology and
              pathophysiology of these essential molecules.
