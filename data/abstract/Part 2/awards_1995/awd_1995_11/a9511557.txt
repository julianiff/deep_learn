Abstract    :
              9511557  Jakubson    Daughters of mothers who were welfare recipients are, other
               things equal, more likely to be welfare recipients themselves.   In order for
              policy to address the issue of welfare transmission,  policy-makers need to
              know more than the fact that there is an  intergenerational link in welfare
              dependency.  The nature of the   transmission mechanism has important
              implications for which types  of policy interventions will be effective.  This
              project will  partition the intergenerational correlation into components 
              attributable to unobserved heterogeneity, associated with the  transmission of
              preferences and/or constraints (which would be  present in the absence of
              parental welfare participation), and  state dependence, or  scarring  (which is
              directly attributable  to parental welfare participation).  Data from the Panel
              Study of  Income Dynamics (PSID) will be used to investigate these  questions. 
                  Two different statistical models are developed and tested using  the PSID. 
              One is based on a sequential choice approach in which   the welfare
              participation decision is conditional on the  fertility decision.  The other
              allows for concurrent choice among  fertility and welfare status.  Within each
              model two approaches  to distinguish the heterogeneity and state dependence
              components   are used.  One approach allows for both family- and individual- 
              specific heterogeneity components and relies on a timing  assumption for the
              decomposition.  In the other, the two  components can be identified without a
              timing assumption, but at   the cost of allowing for only a family-specific
              effect.
