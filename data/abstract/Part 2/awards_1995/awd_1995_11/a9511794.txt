Abstract    :
              Theories of relativistic dissipative fluids will be applied  to study situations
              of astrophysical and experimental  interest.  Constraints relating the
              properties of fluid  stability, causality, and hyperbolicity in these theories 
              can be used to strengthen existing upper limits on the mass  of neutron stars. 
              The behavior of the theories when applied  to a Fermi gas far from equilibrium
              will be studied; whether  nonlinear effects destroy hyperbolicity in this case
              will be  determined.  These results will then be used to apply the  fluid
              models to the study of relativistic fluid collisions,  ranging from heavy ions
              to neutron stars.  Present theories  of relativistic dissipative superfluids
              have been shown to  be physically unacceptable, as all equilibrium states
              within  those theories are unstable.  A newly proposed theory which  seems (on
              the surface) to avoid this problem will be  analyzed in detail, and its
              fundamental properties regarding  stability, causality, and hyperbolicity
              analyzed.    Extreme black holes, possessing degenerate event horizons  and
              zero surface gravity, are currently playing a central  role in work on black
              hole thermodynamics and the  "information loss" puzzle of black hole
              evaporation.  Using  the methods developed by Anderson, Hiscock, and Samuel,
              the  quantum effects of vacuum polarization on an extreme black  hole's
              geometry and thermodynamics will be studied.
