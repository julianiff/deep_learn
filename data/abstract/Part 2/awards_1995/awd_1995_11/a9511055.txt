Abstract    :
                   The sense of smell in mammals generally develops faster than the other
              senses, and newborn animals often show responses to odors before hearing or
              vision are fully developed.  Many senses, including smell, are extremely
              dependent on early experience to develop properly.  It is not clear how the
              chemosensory experience of smell occurs before birth to provide that necessary
              early experience.  This project uses anatomical techniques to examine the
              olfactory system during development, and how anatomical changes occur when
              various techniques are used to block odors.  Mechanisms for such changes could
              include sensory deprivation, deprivation of neural activity, or trophic
              factors.  The novel approach here of odor restriction allows a direct
              comparison to results from nose occlusion, which is the technique usually used.
               These studies will have an impact on both chemosensory and developmental
              neuroscience, and the strong involvement of undergraduates will have an impact
              on their careers.
