Abstract    :
              9511731  Kazerooni  The overall objective of this research project is to design 
              and construct electromagnetic actuators which behave as  Hill's model of human
              muscle predicts.  The researchers  hypothesize that, to restore function
              properly to motor-  impaired humans, the electromagnetic actuators of powered 
              orthotic and prosthetic devices should exhibit behavior  similar to that of
              human muscles.  With the use of emulation  computer software, the investigators
              will emulate Hill's  model in several experimental orthotic devices available
              to  them to determine how the use of such actuators will improve  the
              restoration function in motor-impaired humans.  Following the use of the
              emulation software, design  principles will be derived for an electromagnetic
              actuator  that inherently behaves as Hill's model predicts.    The technology
              to be developed from successful results of  the research can be used by a
              person with mild movement  disorders, such as a mid-level quadriplegic.  It is
              expected  that atrophy and deformity will be minimized and limb  function will
              improve with the development of  an  intelligent orthosis that allows the
              patient's arm to  maneuver in all possible directions.  This intelligent 
              orthosis should become a natural complement of the patient's  arm.  ***
