Abstract    :
              Despite a wealth of laboratory data collected on one species of marmosets, the
              taxonomy of this groups remains highly controversial.  Current opinion varies
              widely on the species diversity within this genus, Callithrix, with between
              three and fifteen species being recognized by different scientists, and there
              are many uncertainties about phylogenetic relationships.    The major goal of
              this project is the preparation of a comparable molecular genetic phylogeny of
              Callithrix, based on DNA sequence variation at both mitochondrial and nuclear
              loci, using hair samples obtained non-invasively.  This phylogeny should
              resolve many issues in Callithrix systematics, including evolutionary
              relationships, status of possible hybrids, and the delineation of species and
              subspecies.  Finally, information relevant to broader evolutionary issues will
              be obtained, including the tempo of evolutionary differentiation in different
              environments (Atlantic forest vs. Amazonia), and a potential example of
              orthogenesis, the theory of metachromism.
