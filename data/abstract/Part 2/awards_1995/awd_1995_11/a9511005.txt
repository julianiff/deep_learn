Abstract    :
              9511005  Huth    In this project a game-theoretic approach is used to explain: 
              1)   when international disputes over political-security issues will  emerge
              between states; 2) why some international disputes involve  high levels of
              diplomatic and military conflict whereas in other  disputes such conflict is
              absent; 3) when will international  disputes be settled by compromise or
              unilateral concessions?   Hypotheses are derived from a game-theoretic model
              and then  systematically tested against historical data on international 
              disputes between 1918-1990 by a series of statistical analyses.   The
              theoretical focus of the project is to examine how democratic  political
              institutions and norms of conflict resolution affect  the foreign policy
              decisions of state leaders.  Propositions on  the relationship between
              democracy and foreign policy will be  derived from a general model of foreign
              policy decision making  which integrates insights from both realism and recent
              domestic  politics approaches to the study of international relations.  ***
