Abstract    :
              IBN-9511359  Axelson, John F.      The development of brain structural and
              behavioral sexual  dimorphisms is a topic of intense investigation, as are
              attempts to  define the factors responsible for inducing the structural
              changes.   However, little information about the different functions of brain 
              dimorphic peptide modulatory systems have been forthcoming.   In  the present
              studies, Dr. John Axelson proposes to investigate how  steroid hormones
              modulate brain development during critical pre-  and post-natal periods.  These
              studies will determine if modulation  of the steroid hormone environment during
              early or late development  influences not only behavioral patterns and memory,
              but also the  amounts of information transmitting molecules in the brain.  Dr. 
              Axelson will be investigating the role of the  vasopressin-containing neurons
              in the brain and whether this  neuropeptide system is involved in sexually
              dimorphic development  of social recognition memories.  Further, it is proposed
              to examine  the role of steroid hormones in the generation of dimorphic 
              patterns of vasopressin expression as a basis for understanding  their role in
              behavioral changes.  The proposed studies will  generate novel information
              about brain development and the  corresponding behaviors that will enhance our
              understanding of  human behavior and cognition.
