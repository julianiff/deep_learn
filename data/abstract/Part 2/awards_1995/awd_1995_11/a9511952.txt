Abstract    :
              Andrew Postlewaite  University of Pennsylvania  SBR-9511952     The P.I.
              proposes to extend on-going research into "marriage models" in which there is a
              pre-match choice of investment/savings that affects the resulting surplus the
              matched pair will share.  The proposal has eight related sub-projects: (1)
              resolve technical questions on the existence of  equilibrium in marriage models
              with savings, (2) demonstrate the impossibility of efficiently dividing the
              surplus in matched pairs, (3) demonstrate the existence of weak-commitment
              equilibrium under very general assumptions, (4) extend the marriage model to
              the case of only one "sex," (5) extend the marriage model to the case of more
              than two groups., (6) explain herd behavior in investment, (7) extend previous
              work on "hybrid" equilibria, and (8) investigate models in which a political
              process provides a nonmarket benefit to relative wealth.
