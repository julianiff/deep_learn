Abstract    :
              Derivation of the explicit analytic equation of motion for  deformable celestial
              bodies, falling at relativistic speeds  in strong gravitational fields, is the
              goal of this work.  Dr. Nordtvedt's work builds on his fully covariant, strong 
              field action principle for the motion of bodies with  spherical extensiol, said
              action principle having been  conjectured and made plausible by exact
              calculations of 1/c2  order motion of such extended bodies.  This action
              principle  for extended bodies also reveals the route for including 
              consideration of body deformation on the relativistic  motion.    Any progress
              which can be made to more accurately describe  the motion of realistic bodies
              falling in strong  gravitational fields will aid in the a-priori calculation of
               gravitational radiation wave form pulses from the type of  astrophysical
              events which have a likelihood of being  observed by gravity wave detectors
              being constructed through  National Science Foundation support.  The
              sensitivity at  which detection of the weakest gravity wave signals will be 
              made depends on the precision to which the signal shape  theoretical templates
              can be made.
