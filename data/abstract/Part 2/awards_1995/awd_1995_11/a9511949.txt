Abstract    :
                Protecting and preserving our natural life-support systems  requires the
              ability to understand the direct and indirect  effects of human activities over
              long periods of time and  over large areas.  Computer simulations are now
              becoming  important tools for investigating these interactions. 
              Spatio-temporal modeling is essential when simulating  heterogeneous
              environments.  These models are necessary for  developing the relatively
              realistic description of past  system behavior that is required for making
              predictions of  the impacts of alternative management policies on future 
              system behavior (Costanza, Sklar, & White, 1990); Risser,  Karr, & Forman,
              1984; Sklar & Costanza, 1991).  The data and  hardware barriers to building
              these complex models have  begun to erode with the increasing availability of
              remote  sensing data and GIS systems to manipulate it, and the  development of
              parallel computer systems.  However,  significant advances in modeling tools
              must take place in  order to and in order for non-computer scientists to take 
              advantage of these new resources.  This document describes a  proposal to
              develop these much-needed spatial modeling  tools.
