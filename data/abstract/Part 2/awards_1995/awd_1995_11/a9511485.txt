Abstract    :
              The European Parliament plays an increasingly important role in the process of
              European integration.  This research project will create four connected
              datasets that will make feasible the first systematic empirical investigation
              of decisionmaking in the European Parliament.  These data sets will consist of
              detailed bills and amendments, histories of proposed legislation, prior and
              subsequent actions external to the EP, and roll call floor votes.  A series of
              case studies will focus attention of European environmental policies.  Broad
              theoretical reasons also motivate this study.  Institutional and partisan
              features of the EP facilitate cooperative decisionmaking which speeds
              integration. Understanding the ways in which these features affect
              decisionmaking can provide important insights into the design of institutional
              structures.
