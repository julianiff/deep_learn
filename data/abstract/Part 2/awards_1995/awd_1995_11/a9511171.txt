Abstract    :
                  Descriptive and Theoretical Studies in Selayarese Syntax       The aim of
              this project is to collect data on the syntax of  Selayarese, an Austronesian
              language from Selayar Island,  Indonesia, and to consider the data in the wider
              comparative  context of a theory of Universal Grammar.       The primary topics
              to be investigated are: the effects of  verbal morphology on syntactic
              structure, word order and  agreement, wh-questions, relative clauses and other
              nominal  structure, further aspects of sentential complementation, and the 
              distribution of the "peripatetic" (Friberg 1992) absolutive  marker. The
              project will make available new information on the  syntax of a little known
              language, and should lead to a greater  understanding of the organization of
              several modules of Universal  Grammar and the ways in which they can be
              parameterized to  partially define the grammars of individual languages.
