Abstract    :
              9511923  Clark       The Nuclear Theory Group at The Ohio State University, 
              supported in part by the National Science Foundation,  studies a broad range of
              problems involving the strong  interaction which is responsible for matter as
              we know it.  Most of this research involves either the direct study of  quantum
              chromodynamics (QCD), the relativistic field theory  of quarks and gluons, or
              its connection to effective  theories of the strong interaction at low
              energies.  QCD  remains unsolved at energy scales relevant for describing 
              nuclei and their constituents.  The challenge for nuclear  theorists is to
              develop methods for directly solving QCD in  the strong-interaction regime, to
              discover connections  between successful nuclear phenomenology and QCD, and to 
              develop effective descriptions of QCD in terms of low-energy  degrees of
              freedom (hadrons).  Research in the Nuclear  Theory Group is progressing in
              each of these areas.  ***
