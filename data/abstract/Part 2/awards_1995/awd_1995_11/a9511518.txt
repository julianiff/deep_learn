Abstract    :
              9511518  Hamm    Every 20th century U.S. state legislative chamber has organized
               its work and completed its tasks by assigning members to smaller  work
              groups--standing committees.  As one would expect, this  prominent role for
              committees in the legislative process has  attracted the attention of citizen,
              press and academic observers.    For example, writing in 1931, it was
              demonstrated that committee  action was the final action for more than 90
              percent of bills  introduced in the Maryland Senate and House during the 1927 
              legislative session.    Among the themes dominating political scientists'
              analysis of  legislative committees from a functional perspective has been 
              their growth in specialization and use as a means for "division  of labor" in a
              chamber.  Based on earlier work and using  organization theory literature,
              several propositions regarding  specialization in legislative committees are
              developed in this  research investigation.  The purpose of the current research
              is  to allow the investigators to:  posit a model of the causes of  committee
              specialization; complete the collection of a data base  on specialization
              indicators for American state legislative  committees; analyze the data base
              resulting from these efforts  using regression analysis; identify study states
              for collecting  committee performance data from this analysis; posit a model of
               the consequences of committee specialization for committee  performance in
              policy and program formulation; initiate the  collection of legislative
              performance data relevant to evaluating  the effects of committee
              specialization; analyze the data base  resulting from these efforts using path
              analysis; and, prepare  written reports and the data base for subsequent
              distribution.    This project promises to substantially enhance our
              understanding  of the topic of this research.  ***
