Abstract    :
              Halbert White  SBR-9511253     The P.I. proposes to use the bootstrap to
              determine the sampling distribution of model specification error tests.  The
              bootstrap has been increasing rapidly in statistics and specification tests,
              where critical values based on asymptotic distributions appear to often lead to
              over-rejection of correct specifications, are a natural place to apply this
              powerful method.  Examples of tests that will be studied are: information
              matrix tests, tests based on nonparametric estimators and neural net
              estimators, and test of whether a particular subset of variables belong in a
              regression.  The P.I. also proposes to develop high breakdown estimators that
              are insensitive to significant amounts of data contamination.  The P.I. also
              intends to apply the methods developed to a number of empirical applications.
