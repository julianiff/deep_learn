Abstract    :
              In this project, the researcher will analyze techniques for combining different
              datasets.  The general purpose of this research is to build on the distinct
              strengths of the different datasets.  Some datasets such as the Current
              Population Survey (CPS) are particularly representative but may contain only
              limited variables.  Other datasets, such as the National Longitudinal Survey
              (NLS) or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) may be less representative
              than the CPS but have the advantage of more detailed information.  In addition,
              datasets such as the NLS and PSID have information on the same units over
              longer periods of time (panel data) rather than only once (cross-sections). 
              Methods will be developed, extending those previously developed in econometrics
              and statistics, that allow combining such datasets.  They will be connected to
              standard methods such as weighting and interpreted in the context of missing
              data problems.  This research will lead to a better understanding of the links
              between techniques used in econometrics, such as generalized method of moments
              estimation, and techniques in statistics such as raking and weighting.  These
              methods will then be applied to artificial as well as real datasets to evaluate
              their performance in a realistic setting.
