Abstract    :
              9511677  Mulroney      Removal of one kidney (uninephrectomy) results in the
              rapid growth of the remaining kidney.  Recent advances using whole animal,
              cellular, and molecular biologic techniques have shown that there are different
              mechanisms involved in this accelerated growth.  Using this model of rapid
              renal growth, Dr. Mulroney has determined that different growth factors are
              stimulated in young and adult male animals, and they appear to govern the type
              of growth that occurs in the regenerating kidney, vis a vis hyperplasia (cell
              multiplication) and hypertrophy (enlargement of existing cells).  Preliminary
              findings for the present proposal have found that there are also differences in
              the mechanism and renal growth response in adult female animals, compared with
              adult males.  These age and sex differences have important implications
              regarding the cellular and molecular controls for cell growth in vivo and
              defining the mechanisms involved in these pathways could provide information on
              basic influencing the growth process.  The broad objective of this proposal is
              to determine the effects of the gonadal (sex) steroids on the compensatory
              renal growth that occurs following uninephrectomy, and identify their
              importance in the final outcome of the type of growth that occurs.  These
              studies should provide important basic information regarding the stimuli and
              mechanisms governing cell and organ growth.  ***
