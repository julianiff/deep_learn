Abstract    :
              9511053  Rasler    This project focuses on the Intifada (1987-1993) in order to 
              extend the theoretical and empirical work on the relationships  between social
              movements, political revolts and protest cycles.   There are three major
              theoretical themes that guide the  hypothesis formation and testing stages:  1)
              the evolution of  protest waves; 2) regime-challenger interactions; and, 3) the
               dynamics of ethnic competition.    The first section of the study examines the
              factors that  influence the shape of the protest wave, e.g., policies of 
              repression/concession, organizational structure and competition,  the role of
              external parties, inter-organizational strife and the  contraction of
              organizational resources.  The second section  investigates the short and long
              term effects of  repression/concessions on bandwagon and spatial diffusion 
              prmcesses.  The third section investigates the rise of ethnic  violence and its
              impact on collective action patterns.    The temporal domain of the study
              covers the 1981-1993 period in  both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  Data on
              the occurrence,  participation and duration of collective action events will be
               collected from two Palestinian newspapers - al-Ouds (Arabic) and  al-Fajr
              (weekly, English) - one Israeli newspaper - Jerusalem  Post - and one regional
              news source - The Foreign Broadcast  Information Service.      The research
              design is longitudinal and the temporal unit is  weekly.  Event-history methods
              will be applied to the analysis.   This research promises to substantially
              enhance our understanding  of this topic.  ***
