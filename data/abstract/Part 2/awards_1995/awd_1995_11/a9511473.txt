Abstract    :
                       This is a study of the labor market impact resulting from declining
              levels of unionization in 18 OECD countries between 1973-1990.   Although trade
              union decline in membership has been carefully recorded, the effects of that
              decline have not been analyzed previously in the ways proposed here.   The
              research argues that labor market trends are the result of political struggles
              among workers, employers, and their representatives.  It tests hypotheses about
               the effects of centralized bargaining, the electoral failure of social
              democratic parties, increased inequality in the work force, and rival economic
              theories about the oil price shock and the growth of world trade.  The mutual
              dependence of union membership and unemployment is examined using statistical
              techniques developed by the researcher.  Because of the possibility of strong
              sectoral trends in earnings and employment , the research is supplemented with 
              comparative case studies of Britain, Germany, and the United States, where
              there are existing data to examine export and sheltered sectors of the national
              economies.   %%%   The research will offer new sociological and institutional
              explanations of important processes of social capital formation that will
              supplement, if not challenge, existing economic explanations.  Through its
              focus on the struggles by workers and employers to affect economic outcomes, it
              links stratification research with political sociology and presents the
              possibility of an enlarged conception of economic sociology.
