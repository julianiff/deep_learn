Abstract    :
              This research program revolves around three different but related projects in
              discrete choice modeling  and estimation. The common theme is the modeling of
              consumer choice behavior, and the estimation of  models of consumer behavior on
              revealed preference data sets.  With the availability of electronic  scanner
              panel data, choice models have become very important for understanding consumer
              behavior.  For  example, such models may be used to evaluate the impact of the
              marketing mix on consumer purchasing  behavior, and to assess the patterns of
              competition in the market place.  The three research projects  in this study
              involve the use of recently developed simulation estimation techniques.  In the
              model of  the first project, consumer choice probabilities are high dimensional
              integrals over unobserved prices  and coupon values, as well as over stochastic
              preference shocks. Thus, Monte-Carlo methods must be  used to simulate the
              likelihood function in the model.  In the second and third projects, both 
              solution of the dynamic programming problem and construction of the likelihood
              function require high  dimensional integrations over stochastic process for
              prices,  preference shocks, etc.  In these  projects we will use MonteCarlo
              methods both to solve consumers' dynamic programming problems and to simulate
              the likelihood function.
