Abstract    :
                  Salamone  9511247    While changes in neurochemicals typically have effects
              on behavior, they may have a very large effect or a minor effect depending upon
              behavioral context.  Dopamine is one such neurochemical.  It is secreted in the
              forebrain and is related to an animal's tendency to produce a response in order
              to receive a reward.  In this project, Dr. Salamone will examine the
              significance of brain dopamine to behavioral performance in situations where
              the context of performance (costs versus benefits) is manipulated.  These
              studies will provide new information to distinguish dopamine effects on neural
              systems controlling motor performance as distinct from those that influence
              motivation.  ***
