              Collaborative Research:  Household Relations, Migration Decisions, and
              Employment Outcomes     This collaborative research proposal requests funding
              to conduct field research and quantitative and qualitative analyses of
              intra-household relationships, migration decisions by different household
              members, and employment outcomes in destination regions.  The research
              questions and design are the result of collaboration among two economists, a
              geographer, and a biostatistician.  The field area is several urban areas in
              Ecuador.  The Ecuadorian setting is characterized by rapid urban population
              growth (including via in-migration) in the context of rapid, policy-induced,
              changes in economic structure.  The field work entails three stages over 18
              months:  extensive surveys of migrant and non-migrant households in destination
              cities;  household surveys in the main origin areas;  and in-depth case
              histories for migrants in destination areas to complement and extend the survey
              findings through detailed examinations of the connections between life,
              household, and work histories.  The results will:  focus attention on household
              structures and dynamics as influences on migration processes;  combine research
              traditions of migration as an individual, household and local-context
              phenomenon;  and relate migration motivations to employment outcomes at the
              destination.
