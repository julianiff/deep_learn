Abstract    :
              Professor Duffy will continue ultracryogenic studies of the  mechanical quality
              factor (Q) of selected polycrystalline  technical materials.  The quality
              factor will be measured on  torsional resonators machined in the unique
              configuration  developed by him.  The configuration permits audio frequency 
              measurement (typically at 1 kHz) over a wide range of Qs  (103 - 108) and a
              wide range of temperatures (50mK - 300K).  Since only a small piece of material
              is involved (typically  6 cm diameter by 6 cm long), the cost of operation and
              the  turn-around time of the complex dilution refrigerator  cryostat needed for
              the very low temperature measurements  are kept low.    The work is to be
              carried out in support of cryogenic (4K)  and ultracryogenic (<100 mK) resonant
              mass gravity wave  antenna development both in the United States and abroad. 
              Close contact will be maintained with the gravity-wave-  detector community. 
              Materials to be studied include those  which offer the most promise for use as
              gravitational wave  detectors of high sensitivity.  This requires materials of 
              high Q, which also have appropriate inertial, elastic and  thermal properties. 
              Specific materials which are the focus  of this study include an explosively
              bonded aluminum alloy  5056 and a series of copper and aluminum alloys.  Grain
              size  and hardness will be evaluated.  Appropriate heat treatments  will be
              developed, which have been found to be so essential  for obtaining high
              ultracryogenic Qs in the materials  studied to date.  Ultralow temperature heat
              capacity and  thermal conductivity studies of selected materials will be 
              carried out.  In addition to supporting gravity wave antenna  development, the
              results should contribute to the  fundamental understanding of acoustic loss
              mechanisms.
