Abstract    :
              9511341  Rush    Cells  in  the nervous system transmit information via
              electrical  voltage  signals  called action potentials.  A  neuron  can  fire 
              action  potentials repetitively, and information from one  neuron  to  another
              can be communicated through the frequency at which  a  neuron  fires. One of
              the goals of this project is  to  elucidate  the   mechanisms  by  which  this 
              frequency  is  modulated.  The  membranes of most neurons contain a class of
              channels that  allow  potassium ions to flow through the membrane. These
              channels  open  rapidly  following the initial voltage increase during an 
              action  potential  and  then close at a slower rate.  This  channel  type 
              gives  rise to a potassium current, the A-current, which inhibits  temporarily
              the voltage increase, and thus serves as an intrinsic  mechanism by which the
              firing frequency is lowered. It  has  been  hypothesized  that this current can
              result in a  broad  range  of  firing  frequencies in a single cell. Dr. Rush
              is a mathematician  who  will  study  the extent to which A-current modulates 
              firing  frequency  in  the presence of other external influences  on  the 
              neuron,  such  as chemical signals released from  other  neurons.  With  an
              understanding of frequency modulation, they will  extend  their analysis of the
              A-current to other types of firing patters,  namely  repetitive  burst  of
              action  potentials.  This  type  of  behavior  has been seen in
              electroencephalograms (EEGs)  recorded  during certain phases of sleep and
              during seizures. It is believe  that  a  delicate  balance  of  the  A-current 
              and  depolarizing  currents  is  important  for the generation  of  such 
              bursts  of  voltage activity.
