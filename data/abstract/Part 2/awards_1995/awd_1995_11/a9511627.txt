              Co-PI  New York University    Understanding Atmosphere-Soil Interactions - A
              Pilot Study of Historic Russian Soils    Archived samples of soils located at
              the Russian Academy of Forestry in St. Petersburg are well documented and in
              exceptionally good condition after a century of storage.  US and Russian
              investigators will identify samples from the collection and corresponding sites
              for future studies on soil dynamics in relation to post-industrial
              atmosphere-soil interactions.  Atmosphere-soil interactions targeted for study
              include carbon cycling, acid rain deposition and effects on buffering
              capacities of soils, and atmospheric contaminants of the post-industrial era. 
              The approach is to establish a suite of samples and corresponding collection
              sites along a climate/soil gradient that can be revisited in 1996/1997. 
              Selecting samples along a gradient enhances understanding of processes that
              control atmosphere-soil interactions such as how rates of carbon turnover vary
              along a precipitation gradient.  This pilot project will ascertain the
              condition of selected samples, availability of documentation on corresponding
              sites from which the samples are believed to have been taken, and the condition
              of the corresponding sites.
