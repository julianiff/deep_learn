Abstract    :
              Evidence that poor and minority neighborhoods suffer disproportionate levels of
              exposure to environmental hazards has mobilized citizen groups, and these
              groups have pressured governmental officials for action to alleviate the
              problems.  The unknown source(s) of environmental inequities raises additional
              questions.  Are government actions directly responsible for inequitable risks
              from environmental pollution?    To date, the contribution of public policy to
              environmental inequity has been viewed as a problem to be remedied rather than
              a hypothesis to be tested.  This research will evaluate the distributional
              consequences of policy decisions in environmental protection. The research will
              establish whether policy decisions produce unequal risks.  If so, the processes
              that generate these policy outcomes will be examined.  A model of environmental
              policymaking will be offered and tested.  The model will provide insight into
              the consequences of market incentives on pollution control as well as the ways
              in which government policy can increase or alleviate environmental inequities.
