Abstract    :
                9511252  Eichengreen    Recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets,
              especially within  the European Monetary System (ERM), has raised new questions
               about the causes of speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates.   It is
              surprising in this light that we do not possess a body of  evidence that
              establishes stylized facts about the behavior of  macroeconomic variables
              around the time of attacks.  The goal of  this project is to develop stylized
              empirical facts about the  behavior of critical economic and political
              variables around the  time of speculative attacks on pegged currencies.  It
              will do so  by developing a data set suitable for studying the causes and 
              consequences of speculative crises and subjecting it to  univariate and
              multivariate statistical analysis.  The project  plans to address questions
              such as the following:  Are there  differences in the behavior of key
              macroeconomic  variable sin  periods prior to speculative attacks on pegged
              exchange rates  compared to other periods?  Are there "early warning signals"
              of  pending currency crises?  Does the behavior of these key  variables change
              in the aftermath of speculative attacks?  Are  political outcomes affected by
              speculative attacks?  Do answers  to these questions different in the different
              times and places in  which exchange rates are pegged?  Do they differ for ERM
              and non-  ERM currencies, in particular?  Or are speculative attacks all 
              alike?
