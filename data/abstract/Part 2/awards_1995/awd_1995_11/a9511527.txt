Abstract    :
              This project examines the questions of whether and how the costs of war - in
              purely human terms - affects the conduct of domestic politics.  The study
              focuses on the link between U.S. casualties, Congressional policies, and
              electoral politics during the Korean and Vietnam wars.  Casualties are seen as
              a framing mechanism that determines the relative salience of war as a political
              issue and interacts with candidate positions to influence electoral outcomes. 
              Incumbent positions, interacting with challenger positions and a state's
              casualty rate, shape electoral outcomes, controlling for other well-recognized
              peace-time predictors of Senate elections.   This research  will allow
              assessment of the claim that the link between foreign and domestic politics was
              unique in the Vietnam War, a relationship that fundamentally changed over time
              after the 1968 Tet offensive.  The modeling strategy and analysis plan adopted
              by the principal investigators permits a broader and deeper understanding of
              the processes of political representation.
