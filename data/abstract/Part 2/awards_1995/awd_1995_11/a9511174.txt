Abstract    :
              9511174  Hencheck  The properties of the very neutron-deficient isotopes near
              the  proton-drip line are of great interest to astrophysicists who  model the
              rapid hydrogen burning process in very hot, dense  stellar environments. 
              However, little is known about many of the  key nuclei that lie along the
              proton drip line.  Their masses,  lifetimes, and decay modes must therefore be
              estimated in order  to include them in the calculation of the rp-process path. 
              The  uncertainties in the predicted ground state properties, together  with a
              lack of knowledge about excited levels, which might serve  as final states in
              B-decay processes, are enough to produce large  uncertainties in the resulting
              astrophysical calculations.  The  goal of this project is to determine the
              half-lives and decay  modes of several of the very proton rich nuclei in the
              A=90 to  100 region including, but not limited to 96Cd, 98Cd, 96Ag and  98Ag. 
              The experiments would be performed at GSI Darmstadt, where  isotopes will be
              produced using the FEBIAD and FEBIAD-B2 ion  sources.  The experimental method
              would closely follow the  methods used successfully at GSI.  ***
