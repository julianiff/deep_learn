Abstract    :
              This project provides support for a conference entitled,  "Psychological
              Perspectives on Environmental and Ethical  Issues in Management."  The
              conference will encourage  leading psychologists to contribute intellectually
              to many  of the environmental issues facing contemporary society.  The first
              goal of the conference is to apply psychological  research and theory to
              contemporary environmental and  ethical issues.  The second goal is to expose
              psychologists  to an important area where their research can make a 
              difference.  Issues to be addresses at the conference  include decisions over
              the use of scarce resources, creating  polluting byproducts, exposing workers
              to risky substances,  and marketing profitable but potentially harmful
              products.  Leading social, cognitive, and decision psychologists will  present
              their research at the conference and contribute  chapters to an edited volume.
