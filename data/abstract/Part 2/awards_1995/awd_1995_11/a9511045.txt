              Moser, S.  This support is for a Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Award. 
              Current efforts in the assessment of uncertainty in global change are largely
              confined to technical and scientific uncertainties. The treatment of scientific
              uncertainty fails to address the broader uncertainties involved in the human
              dimensions of global change. The first goal of this dissertation research is to
              help broaden uncertainty analysis and assessment beyond the physical dynamics
              of global change by exploring how social uncertainties and the domain of
              ignorance can be incorporated into uncertainty analysis. The substantive
              context is that of potential impacts from human-induced sea-level rise (SLR) on
              the natural and social systems along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts. Second, the
              study aims to assess how uncertainties are currently addressed in policy-making
              and management systems and how they may better be confronted to allow for a
              more effective human response to climate change and SLR  The study aims to (1)
              contribute a broadened conceptual framework of uncertainty and ignorance as a
              basis for a more inclusive and robust assessment of uncertainties in global
              change, (2) evaluate current scientific uncertainty and sea-level rise impact
              assessment and management efforts, and (3) point toward venues of improvement
              both for uncertainty assessment and for policy-making for and management of
              high-uncertainty, high-stake situations that incorporate human-dimension
              uncertainties and ignorance.  f8 Û-ª  þ      +                          Ûª? ÑOh
