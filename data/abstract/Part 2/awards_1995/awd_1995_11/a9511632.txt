Abstract    :
              9511632  Weinberg       String theory is an attempt to move beyond the quantum 
              mechanical description of elementary particles as point like  particles to a
              formulation of them as excitations of a  microscopic string-like objects. 
              These excitations would include  not only quarks, gluons, leptons ,etc., but
              also the graviton,  the quantum excitation of gravity so that one would have a
              truly  unified theory of all interactions.       One aim of this research is a
              better and deeper  understanding of space-time and a quantum theory of gravity.
               A  second aim is to explore the links of such a theory to  conventional
              particle physics as described by the standard model  and its implications for
              astrophysical and cosmological  measurements.  ***
