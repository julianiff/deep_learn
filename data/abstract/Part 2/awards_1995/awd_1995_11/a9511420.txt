Abstract    :
              SBR-9511420  Alberto Alesina, Harvard University    The proposal seeks to
              support ongoing NSF-supported research  on the optimal size and composition of
              fiscal jurisdictions.  The main idea is that there is a tradeoff between large
              and small governments: large governments can provide many public goods more
              efficiently, but small government units can more closely mirror the preferences
              of their citizens.  Secessions and unions allow citizens to choose the size of
              their political units.  The questions raised have obvious bearing on such
              issues as: the degree of fiscal and monetary coordination within the European
              Union, the sudden disintegration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the
              split-up of Czechoslovakia, the re-unification of Germany, the growing
              separatist movements in Canada, and the movement to transfer many fiscal
              programs-- from environmental regulation to Medicare-- from the US federal
              government to the states.
