Abstract    :
              This investigation will explore the integration of science into the criminal
              justice system of the United States in the 20th century.   It will involve an
              analysis of efforts nationwide to abolish the elective office of coroner and
              replace it with a medical examiner system, of conflicts between scientific and
              legal definitions of proof, of reformers' efforts to convince the public of the
              inherent validity of professional forensic science, and of reactions of the
              legal profession, in particular public prosecutors, to the increased
              availability and use of forensic science.  Changes in criminal procedure, in
              the law of evidence, and circuit court and appellate decisions that detail
              evolving interpretations of the province of the jury will form a central part
              of this investigation.  The ethical conflicts facing forensic scientists who
              embrace the ethos of scientific objectivity while working, for the most part,
              as employees of the State and witnesses for the prosecution, will also be
              examined.  The grant provides support for travel to archives in San Francisco,
              Wichita, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York, for research assistance, and for use
              of the facilities for research in science, law, and medicine at Harvard
              University.  The project will produce articles and a book length manuscript
              examining the role of the jury in the face of increasing fear of crime and
              desire for law and order and the efficient administration of criminal justice.
