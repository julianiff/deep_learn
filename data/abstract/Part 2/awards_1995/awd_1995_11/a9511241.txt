Abstract    :
              9511241  PALKA  This research will investigate a novel gene that has been found
              to  be important in sensory system development.  This gene, called  "defective
              modalities" ("demo"), when mutated, results in  abnormalities in the visual,
              olfactory, and gustatory systems.  The  experiments that will be performed take
              advantage of the power of  an invertebrate model system to analyze this gene at
              a number of  levels.  Physiological analysis will more completely define the 
              nature of the defects caused by mutation of the demo gene, a  molecular
              biological analysis will characterize the gene and its  products, and
              ultrastructural analysis will be used to define the  subcellular localization
              of demo expression.  Based on previous  phenotypic analysis, it is hypothesized
              that the demo product is  involved, as either a receptor or adhesion molecule,
              in synaptic  transmission in sensory systems.  The multidisciplinary analyses 
              described above are designed to test this hypothesis.  The results  of these
              experiments will provide basic information about the role  of adhesion
              molecules and receptors in the development of sensory  systems.
