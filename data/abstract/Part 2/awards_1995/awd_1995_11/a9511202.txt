Abstract    :
              The sampling design and sample size of most large scale national surveys are
              usually determined so as to produce a national estimate of a parameter of
              interest with a desired level of precision.  Quite often there is a need to
              produce similar estimates with the same level of precision for certain
              subnational regions (such as states or counties).   However, the small samples
              associated with subnational regions do not produce reliable estimates. 
              Problems of this kind are known as small area estimation problems.  Reliable
              small area statistics are needed by various federal and local government
              agencies for policy making and the allocation of funds.  The empirical Bayes
              (EB) and hierarchical Bayes (HB) methods have been widely used to produce small
              area statistics.  These methods use explicit hierarchical models to borrow
              strength from related resources.  This research extends the empirical Bayes
              (EB) and hierarchical Bayes (HB) methods to address the following issues in
              small area estimation:  (1) Measurement errors in survey responses; (2) Small
              area statistics from a dual-frame sampling design; and (3) Estimation of small
              sample means under exponential power distributions.
