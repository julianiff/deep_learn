Abstract    :
              Student Pugwash USA , a national, educational, non-profit organization based in
              Washington DC is dedicated to building a commitment among young people to
              integrate social concerns into their academic, professional, and personal
              lives.  The Pugwash organization, through a variety of interdisciplinary
              activities, focuses on leadership development and interactive learning,
              educating young people on the relevance of science and technology to their own
              lives, and on its ability to shape the future of the global community.  This
              award is in partial support of three important components of  these activities:
              1) the coordination of an international conference on science and technology
              themes,  2) the publication of a resultant Science, Technology, and Society
              (STS) Guidebook for use by university students and high school teachers, and 
              3) the support of  a Chapter Program which coordinates  nearly 150 local
              campus-based events each year.  More specifically,  under this award,  Pugwash
              will coordinate an international conference on `Science, Technology, and
              Ethical Priorities` with working groups in International Weapons Trade;
              Emerging Infectious Diseases; Alternative Energy Sources; Access and the
              Internet; Water Quality and Availability;  and Public Participation in
              Scientific Decision-making.  Second, it will edit and produce the resulting
              Global Issues Guidebook, which will be authored by the International Conference
              Participants and other students.  Third,  Pugwash will disseminate and
              implement the Global Issues Guidebook among high school teachers, national
              student organizations, and over 22 Student Pugwash USA chapters/contacts on
              high school, college, and university campuses nationwide.
