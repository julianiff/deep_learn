Abstract    :
              9511674  Northmore  The processing of information by neurons in the brain 
              depends upon their ability to respond discriminatively to  the multitude of
              signals impinging upon them from sense  organs and other neurons.  The most
              important component of a  neuron for this function is the branched dendritic
              tree that  collects signals at numerous synapses distributed over its  surface
              membrane.  In previous work, silicon microcircuits  were developed that modeled
              neurons with extensively  branched dendrites with simple, passive properties. 
              These  electronic neurons successfully discriminate particular  patterns of
              input when delivered to the appropriate  synapses.  The proposed research will
              build into the  dendrites active mechanisms capable of local amplification  of
              signals.  This will be achieved by mimicking certain  chemical- and
              voltage-dependent processes occurring at  synapses in biological neurons,
              processes that are thought  to be the basis for learning.  As more accurate
              models,  these circuits will improve our understanding of information 
              processing by neurons, both individually and in networks.  They will also
              result in artificial neurons of greater  processing power that could be
              harnessed for robotics.  ***
