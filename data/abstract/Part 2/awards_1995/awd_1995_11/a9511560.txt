Abstract    :
              The scientific study of judicial politics stands at the brink of becoming
              marginal to the discipline.  Recent trends indicate articles have not increased
              despite the increase in journal space, fewer than half of the doctoral
              dissertations completed in the subfield are empirical or formal rather than
              prescriptive or doctrinal, and the top 25 universities employ relatively few
              scholar in the area of law and courts - even fewer with a scientific
              orientation.    To respond to these disturbing patterns, a series of annual
              conferences is planned.  These conferences will increase interaction among
              members of the subfield, serve to attract and socialize graduate students, and
              build bridges between research in the subfield and the rest of the discipline.
