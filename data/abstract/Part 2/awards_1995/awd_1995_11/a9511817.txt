Abstract    :
              Ethical Issues in Physics: Survey, Workshop, and Text Development.  Concern on
              the part of some physicists regarding ethical issues in physics is amply
              demonstrated through articles in various publications directed toward
              physicists, sessions organized by the Forum on Physics and Society at American
              Physical Society meetings, and discussions during the recent Ethical Issues in
              Physics Workshop held at Eastern Michigan University.  In this project, the PIs
              propose to survey members of the physics academic community to determine which
              universities are most interested in incorporating ethical issues into their
              physics curricula and what topics they would be most interested in seeing in an
              ethics text.  Another survey of physicists in industrial and governmental labs
              will seek to determine what formal training in ethical issues would be
              beneficial to students whose careers take them in that direction.  A second
              workshop will be held to extend the recently distributed Ethical Issues In
              Physics Workshop Proceedings to produce a text suitable for a one term, one
              hour per week seminar course for advanced undergraduates and graduate students
              majoring in physics.  This text would be placed in the public domain to
              encourage as wide a usage as possible.
