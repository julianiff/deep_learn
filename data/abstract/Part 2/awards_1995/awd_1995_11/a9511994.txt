Abstract    :
                          This project is concerned with the theoretical analysis of 
              alternative rules for monetary policy.  More specifically, the  aim is to
              better understand the consequences of policy rules that  involve use of a
              short-term interest rate as the instrument in  terms of which the monetary
              authority formulates its policy over  short periods of time.  The project will
              also consider the extent  to which interest-rate smoothing conflicts with other
              aims of  policy, including both price-level stabilization and  stabilization of
              output and employment.         The research seeks to bring the theoretical
              literature in  monetary economics into closer contact with the problems of 
              contemporary monetary policy.  The theoretical literature to  date has largely
              conceived of monetary policy in terms of  alternative paths for a monetary
              aggregate, which is treated as  being under the direct control of the monetary
              authority.  But,  while operating procedures of that sort have often been 
              advocated by academic critics of central bank policies, central  banks have
              seldom operated in that way.  Recently the U.S.  Federal Reserve has ceased to
              use monetary aggregates as guides  to policy, even in the role of intermediate
              targets.  A  theoretical understanding of the properties of the kinds of 
              procedures currently being used or contemplated is badly needed.  ***
