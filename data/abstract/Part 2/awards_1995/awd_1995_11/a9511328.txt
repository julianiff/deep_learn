Abstract    :
                   Differences in behavior between male and female animals are  reflected in
              structural differences within the brain.  The  hypothalamus is a brain region
              where there is strong ilteraction  between hormones and the brain, and these
              neuroendocrine events are  very important during development.  Nerve cells, or
              neurons, often  are clustered into groups called nuclei.  Besides neurons, the 
              brain is packed with cells called glial cells, which have a variety  of
              functions that modulate neural development and activity.  This  project asks
              novel questions on whether glial cells in a nucleus of  the hypothalamus are
              sexually differentiated during a neonatal  "critical period."  Cellular marking
              techniques and molecular  biology are used to explore cellular changes in
              morphology and gene  expression in these glial cells in response to steroid
              hormones.   Similar techniques will be used to localize sites of membrane 
              receptors for steroids, to determine whether the steroid action is  directly on
              glial cells, or instead is an indirect influence via  steroid-concentrating
              neurons.   Results will be important for  developmental neuroscience as well as
              neuroendocrinolgy, and will  help understand how the basic structure of the
              brain is related to  behavior.
