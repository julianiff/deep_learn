Abstract    :
                  Earnest  9511238    All living things have internal "clocks" so that even
              when they are placed in constant environmental conditions, certain
              physiological functions display spontaneous changes that cycle with a regular
              period of about 24 hours.  Specific cells in the hypothalamic region of the
              brain are believed to generate the rhythm, but how they do so is unknown.  With
              this award, Dr. David Earnest will test if individual brain cells are
              programmed for spontaneous rhythms by cloning individual cells and studying
              their innate potential to display rhythmic changes in function.  This work will
              advance basic understanding of biological rhythms, and may also provide cell
              lines for future detailed biophysical qtudies of the mechanisms of rhythm
              generation.  ***
