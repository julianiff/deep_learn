Abstract    :
                                  IBN-9511432  William Kristan    To move, soft-bodied animals
              must first contract muscles to make  themselves stiff, then contract the same
              or other muscles to  lengthen, shorten or bend. This temporary stiffness
              effectively  serves as a "hydroskeleton" on which the animals move. The same 
              kind of hydroskeletons are used by tubular organs such as  tentacles on an
              octopus, the trunk of elephants, or our own  tongues and intestines. The
              principles underlying the control of  hydroskeletons is not well-understood,
              largely because the  arrangement of the muscles is complex and because it is
              very  difficult to obtain all the needed physiological and mechanical 
              measurements from a single animal or organ. These studies will  use the
              medicinal leech to study hydroskeletons because all the  relevant properties of
              the nervous system and muscular system can  be measured in this animal. This
              multidisciplinary group of  scientists have constructed a model of the
              mechanics that  produces reasonable estimates of some behaviors, such as 
              shortening and crawling. Now they will measure dynamic properties  of the
              muscles and add them to the biomechanical model, so that  faster behaviors,
              such as swimming, can be explained. The  completed model should serve as a more
              general description of  hydroskeletons that can be used for a better
              understanding of  tentacles, trunks, tongues and intestines.
