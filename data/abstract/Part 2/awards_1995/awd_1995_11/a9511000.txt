Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the travel of young  scientists, especially
              women and minority scientists, to the  Third International Conference on
              Intelligent Systems in  Molecular Biology (ISMB) in Cambridge, England. The 
              conference focuses on applying computational techniques  drawn from artificial
              intelligence, machine learning,  intelligent databases, qualitative and
              quantitative  modelling, parallel computing and robotics to biological 
              problems in the areas of genetics, sequence analysis,  protein structure,
              molecular evolution and development. The  conference will bring together
              computer scientists with  biologists for cross-disciplinary exchange of results
              and  ideas. The conference will include refereed papers, posters, 
              demonstrations, an archival proceedings, tutorials and  invited speakers.
