Abstract    :
                   The auditory nerve contains thousands of fibers from single nerve cells
              (neurons), carrying information from the ear to the brain.  A sound stimulus
              that is a single tone has the properties of frequency (pitch) and intensity
              (loudness).  The normal environment is full of far more complex sounds, and in
              many cases the intensities of various parts of a complex sound change rapidly
              with time.  Such fluctuations in sound intensity produce dynamic or transient
              responses in auditory neurons which carry important information in complex
              sound stimuli such as speech.  This proposal explores how the auditory system
              may have specialized mechanisms to process dynamic responses and may extend the
              dynamic operating range compared to the steady-state range of hearing.  A novel
              technique of sinusoidal amplitude modulation is used along with
              electrophysiological recording of single neurons and with the newly-discovered
              modulation-following response, which is a compound response.  Results will be
              important for models of how the sound information is transmitted from receptor
              cells in the inner ear to the nerve cells of the auditory nerve and so to the
              brain.  The results will have an impact beyond auditory neuroscience to sensory
              neuroscience in general because of the importance of coding mechanisms, and may
              become applicable not only to hearing disabilities, but to communications
              technology and artificial speech recognition devices.
