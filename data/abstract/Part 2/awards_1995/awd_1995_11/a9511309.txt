Abstract    :
              IBN-9511309  Jaffe    The  hippocampal  formation is a region  of  the  brain 
              that  is  important for certain aspects of learning and memory. The goal of 
              this  project  is  to examine how an important component  of  the  hippocampus,
               the  CA3 region, might process,  store  and  recall  specific  patterns of
              information. A computational model  of  the  CA3  neural  network  will be used
              to test  hypotheses.  Specific  parameters regarding the firing properties of
              inhibitory  neurons  and  certain  aspects of synaptic transmission will  be 
              obtained  using  state-of-the-art  electrophysiological  recording  methods 
              from  neurons  in hippocampal slices. The computer  network  will  contain
              1,000 to 10,0000 neurons based on published data and  the  experimental data
              from inhibitory neurons. A key feature  of  the  network  will  be  that
              excitatory connections between  pyramidal  neurons will potentiate or depress
              based on biophysical rules for  synaptic  potentiation and depression. The CA3 
              network  will  be  trained  with different patterns of input to test the 
              following:  1)  can  the network can discriminate between input patterns,  2) 
              can the network complete partially presented patterns, and 2)  is  information 
              distributed across the network. This  work  will  be  important  for  our 
              understanding of  how  this  region  of  the  hippocampus is involved in
              associative information storage.
