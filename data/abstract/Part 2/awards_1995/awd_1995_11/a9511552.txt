Abstract    :
              ***  9511552  Wu    This award supports collaboration between Jiezie Wu, Jain- 
              Ming Wu, University of Tennessee Space Institute, George  Carnevale, Scripps
              Institute of Oceanography, and Tong  Binggang, Yin Xieyuan, and Ma Huiyang,
              University of Science  and Technology, Hefei, China, on the mechanism,
              receptivity,  and control of compressible, heat-conducting vortices.  The 
              project proposes a thorough and detailed investigation of  the stability and
              mechanics of compressible vortices, and  concerns questions which are both of
              fundamental importance  and practical relevance.  The Chinese partners are from
              the  University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), a key  university
              affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  USTC received funding from
              the Chinese NSF for a "key"  project on the mechanisms of vortices, separation,
              and their  control in complex gaseous media.  This entitled USTC to a  large
              influx of funds (by Chinese standards) and provides a  valuable opportunity for
              US researchers to take advantage of  complementary research and
              instrumentation.  The structure,  instability, and breakdown of a vortex core
              have been  studied intensively over the past few decades because of the 
              relevance to almost all fluid systems with small viscosity  in nature and in
              technology.  The proposed work could  represent important progress in
              understanding more  compressible and heat conducting vortical flows, ranging 
              from geophysical vortices such as hurricanes and tornadoes,  to vortices in
              technology such as the vortex system around a  supersonic aircraft.  ***
