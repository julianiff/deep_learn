Abstract    :
                  9511655  Semmlow    In  terms  of speed and accuracy, the systems in the 
              brain  that  control  eye  movements (the oculomotor control systems)  produce 
              the  highest  motor performance that humans can  accomplish.  The  controllers
              for these movements have two great challenges: 1) the  need  for  a  quick 
              response  despite  delays  while  the  brain  processes  the  necessary
              information and 2) the need  to  attain  accurate  positioning despite errors
              in the neural  and  muscular  apparatus.  These  two  challenges are best  met 
              with  different  control  strategies.  Feedback  can  produce  extremely 
              accurate  responses  but  the  delays in the feedback loop  limit  response 
              times.  Alternatively, preprogrammed control can  generate  rapid  responses, 
              but  these  responses  suffer  in  accuracy.   Recent  experimental  evidence 
              indicates  that  the  brain  solves  this  problem  by  using  both 
              strategies,  either  simultaneously  or  sequentially.  This multiple
              independent controller  approach  is  made  possible by feedback and adaption.
              These investigators  are  constructing  a  systems-analytic model  using  the 
              three  basic  control  strategies,  multi-tasking, feedback  and  adaption,  to
               understand   the  extraordinary  performance  achieved   by   the  oculomotor
              control systems. The control concepts revealed by this  approach  may  be 
              applicable to artificial  systems  faced  with  similar challenges.
