Abstract    :
                   One sensory system that has not received much study is electroreception,
              the capability of some animals, particularly sharks and some electric fish, to
              detect extremely tiny electrical signals in the watery environment.  This sense
              can be important in finding food, in species-specific communication, and in
              navigation.  The receptor cells have extraordinary sensitivity to minuscule
              electrical signals, by mechanisms that have not yet been clarified.  This
              project uses electrophysiological and optical recording techniques to examine
              how the ionic current channels across the cell membrane are activated in
              electroreceptor cells, and mathematical modeling techniques to make testable
              predictions about these biophysical properties.  Results will have impact on
              how cells of a related type work in the lateral line organs of fish, and in the
              vertebrate inner ear.  Understanding the high sensitivity of these cells will
              be useful in understanding other sensory systems in general, and perhaps
              relevant to claims about effects of weak electrical fields on biological tissue
              in general.
