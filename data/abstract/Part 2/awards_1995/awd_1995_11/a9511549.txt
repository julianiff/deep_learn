Abstract    :
              This proposal is an RUI request for the study of, "Electron  Impact Excitation
              of the Helium 11S-3,41P and Atomic  Hydrogen 12S-32P transitions".  It is for
              electron-photon  coincidence measurements to determine the electron impact 
              differential cross-section for excitation of  11S-3,41P  transitions in helium.
               The proposal also call for extension  of the measurements to hydrogen.
