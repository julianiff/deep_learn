Abstract    :
              Robept Wilson  Stanford University  SBR-9511209    The proposal consists of four
              projects involving the design of markets.  The first project concerns the
              design of multi-item auctions and other mechanisms for allocating multiple
              units of an indivisible good.  Among the issues that will be addressed are: (I)
              the conjecture that the oral double auction is a "universal mechanism" for at
              least some preferences, and (ii) the modeling of the puzzling outcomes of some
              experimental auctions.  The second project continues current research by the
              P.I. on game theoretic analysis of legal discovery.  The third project will
              study multidimensional mechanism design.  The fourth project continues current
              research by the P.I. on the efficient computation of behavioral strategies of
              extensive-form games. This will make use of the discovery by von Stengel of a
              scheme that is linear in the number of information sets.
