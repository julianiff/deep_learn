Abstract    :
              SBR-9511965  Charles H. Wood  University of Texas at Austin    Tenure Security
              and Resource Use in the Amazon    Private land ownership has been hypothesized
              as one way to reduce elvironmental degradation by small farmers in tropical
              settings, because of a longer time horizon of farmers who own their land.  The
              research tests this hypothesis through in-person interviews of 400 farmers in
              the Para State of Brazil.  Half of the farmers to be interviewed own their
              land, and half do not have title to their land, because a national program of
              land redistribution was begun but not completed in this state.  Thus the State
              offers a natural experiment, with farmers facing similar physical and economic
              environments have different land-tenure status.  Through the process of
              interview and inspection, the researchers will be able to determine farm
              attributes, farmer background and perception, and farming practices.  A range
              of statistical analysis will be performed on the resultant data to uncover the
              relationships among these characteristics, particularly between land tenure and
              land-use practices such as deforestation, crop choice, and intensity of land
              use.
