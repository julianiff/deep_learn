Abstract    :
              9511764  Laurent    Although brains and computers are thought to be quite
              similar,  the mechanisms which they use to encode and store information are 
              fundamentally different. This is partly because computers were  developed by
              engineers using tools of formal logic to solve  rather limited sets of
              problems, while brains were developed over  millions of years with selective
              pressure of evolution as the  only engineer. Indeed, brains evolved to increase
              the chances of  survival of their "owners", and thus primarily to facilitate
              the  detection of prey, predators and mates. Consequently, they  succeeded in
              solving the very complex problems of pattern  recognition, problems which
              present computers are notoriously  poor at handling. How do we recognize
              something as complex as a  face or an odor, how do we store their infinite
              number of  possible appearances, how does our brain represent them with 
              neuronal activity patterns? To understand this, we must  understand coding in
              the nervous system; we need to determine the  rules that underlie stimulus
              representation in the brain.  Conventional views of coding by the brain hold
              that information  resides in the average number of impulses produced per unit
              time  (rate coding); the role of relative timing of impulses produced  by
              groups of neurons has not been carefully evaluated. The work  of this young
              scientist focuses on circuits that process smells.  Experiments are designed to
              determine whether the relative timing  of neuronal impulses (temporal coding)
              is a potential carrier for  information.
