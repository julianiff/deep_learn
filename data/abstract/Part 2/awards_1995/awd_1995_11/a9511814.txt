Abstract    :
              9511814  Kuo    The  goal of this research project is to understand how the
              human  brain  puts  together  thousands of pieces  of  information  from 
              sensors  throughout the body, such as eyes, the  inner  ear,  and  receptors 
              in joints and muscles, to form a picture of where  the  limbs  are and how they
              are moving. This information is used  for  planning and control of movement. It
              is a process that the  brain  carries out subconsciously; it is critically
              important for proper  balance,  to keep up from falling; it provides athletes
              with  the  ability  to  move  fluidly and skillfully and allows  seamen  and 
              astronauts  to  adjust movements to their new  environments.  The  approach 
              used in this study is to integrate techniques from  two  scientific fields.
              Physiological studies describe how signals are  produced by the sensors and
              define the places in the brain  where  these signals are transmitted. Control
              engineering describes  how  signals  of many types can be used to perform a
              useful  task.  In  this  project,  physiologists  and control  engineers  will 
              work  together  to  examine  the  differences  in  balance  control  in 
              astronauts  before  and after spaceflight. The  adaptations  that  take  place
              during spaceflight make it possible to determine some  of the factors that are
              and are not relevant to control of moment  and,   therefore,  to  explain  some
               of  the  basic   mechanisms  underlying control of movement.
