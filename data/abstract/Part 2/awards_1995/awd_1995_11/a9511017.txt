Abstract    :
              IBN-9511017  Buckley, Kathleen M.      The formation of vesicles containing
              product secreted by cells of  the brain, and other tissues, occurs by two
              mechanisms.  First,  vesicles may be formed from newly produced proteins as
              occurs  during neural development, and second, neurons recycle vesicles 
              following the secretion of included products by the cells.  The  proteins
              involved in vesicle recycling contain targeting sequences  that direct their
              recovery by the cell.  In the proposed studies,  Dr. Buckley will investigate
              the molecular mechanisms involved in  vesicle recycling with particular
              attention to the molecules  involved in targeting the recovery of the proteins
              by the cell.   Dr. Buckley will examine the role of a synapse-specific, vesicle
               associated protein called AP-3.  The effect of overexpression of  this protein
              on vesicle recycling will be examined, and several  novel approaches will be
              used to identify proteins associated with  AP-3 that may also participate in
              the reuptake of membrane into  vesicles.  The proposed studies will provide
              fundamental  information on the mechanisms cells in the brain, and throughout 
              the body for that matter, use to communicate with one another.   These studies
              have great potential for providing novel information  related to human
              physiology and pathophysiology.
