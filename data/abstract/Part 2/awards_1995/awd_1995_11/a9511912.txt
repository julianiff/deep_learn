Abstract    :
              EEC-9511912  Nail    Pharmaceutical costs, along with medical costs, are rising
              sharply.    Research can help contain some of these rising costs in the 
              manufacturing area.  An NSF planning award, EEC-9421600, provided  funding to
              Purdue University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmacal  Sciences to hold a
              meeting with pharmaceutical companies to  determine their interest in forming
              an Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center in Pharmaceutical
              Processing.    The Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy at Purdue 
              University proposes to establish a Industry/University Cooperative  Research
              Center for Pharmaceutical Processing.      The purpose of the Center will be to
              explore and develop new  technology for pharmaceutical processing, to foster
              collaborative  research project between industrial and academic scientists, and
              to  promote an interdisciplinary approach to training students in 
              pharmaceutical process research and development.    The Center's initial
              research agenda will address:  1)  Supercritical Fluid Technology for Particle
              Size Reduction; 2)  Photon Migratimn Measurement for Process Monitoring; 3) 
              Sterilization of Emulsions; 4) Effect of Milling on Particle  Morphology; 5)
              Freeze Drying; 6) Effect of Particle Shape  Characteristics on Blending
              Dynamics; 7) Effect of Initial Particle  Morphology on Granule Strength and
              Shape Following West  Granulation; and 8) Nucleation and Crystal Growth During
              Drying.
