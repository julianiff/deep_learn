Abstract    :
              SBR-9511465  Derek C. Jones, Hamilton College    This project will collect data
              on 100 newly privatized firms in St. Petersburg, Russia.  This new, and
              potentially very useful, data will be combined with previously collected on
              firms in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to study the effect of ownership forms,
              particularly employee ownership, on firm performance.  As an example, do firms
              with high levels of employee ownership have substantially different levels of
              labor productivity than do firms in which there is no employee ownership?  Does
              the level of employee ownership affect the way the firm adjusts to demand
              shocks and price changes?  The swift transformation of the economies of these
              countries from command to market-based has created an important "natural
              experiment"  with to test theories about the incentive effects of ownership and
              control of the firm by its employees.  This "experiment" is made richer by the
              fact that, although they all began with similar economic environments, since
              independence the Baltic Republics and Russia have followed very different paths
              concerning privatization.  The empirical work will consist of the estimation of
              the productivity effect of ownership variables using a standard production
              function framework and the estimation of discrete choice models of the
              ownership and control chosen for the firm.
