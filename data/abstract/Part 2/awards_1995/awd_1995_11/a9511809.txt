Abstract    :
                This collaborative research grant supports Dr. Timothy Fossum, Professor of
              Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, to work with
              colleagues in South Africa and Australia on enhancements to the PC-Xinu
              operating system.   The international partners are Richard J. Foss, Lecturer in
              Computer Science at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa; and
              Christopher Chlap of the Department of Information Sciences and Engineering,
              University of Canberra, Australia.  The research in South Africa will focus on
              implementing real-time features in PC-Xinu, especially as they relate to
              control of devices for generating music.  A particular emphasis will be Petri
              net-like real-time synchronization features.  The work in Australia will design
              a dynamic device-allocation mechanism and implement per-process memory
              protection, to improve on limitations in the current version of PC-Xinu. 
              Extensions to the Xinu system to support new synchronization primitives and new
              high-speed protocols should enhance the attractiveness of Xinu as a teaching
              tool, especially for instruction in real-time systems, and in networking. All
              three research partners have experience in using and extending Xinu.  This
              project promises to strengthen cross-fertilization among ongoing research being
              conducted by the investigators on three continents.
