Abstract    :
              Ernst Berndt and Zvi Griliches  SBR-9511550     This proposal will continue
              ongoing research into the incorporation of technical change into price indexes.
               This is an important practical issue since the failure to account for changing
              quality is thought to be the largest source of bias in aggregate price indexes.
              And price indexes are used for such important tasks as the adjustment of social
              security payments to offset inflation, the implementation of cost-of-living
              clauses in union labor contracts, and the setting of monetary policy.  The key
              problem in accounting for changes in quality is the determination of
              pre-introduction reservation prices for new goods.  The proposal reviews a
              number of ways of doing this.  These include using hedonic regressions,
              comparing branded and generic good prices, and estimating differentiated demand
              models.  The P.I.s will implement these various approaches using data on
              pharmaceutical products and personal computers.  In addition, they will seek
              out other data sources, such as scanner data.
