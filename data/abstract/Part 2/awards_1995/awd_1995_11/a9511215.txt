Abstract    :
              9511215  William Wright    One of the goals of neuroscience is to understand
              what happens in  our brains when we learn. A powerful approach to finding
              answers  to this question is provided by studying the brains of early  animals
              and asking how much of what happens is similar to  processing in early animals
              and how much occurs only in higher  animals. The work of this group of
              neuroscientists examines  mechanisms of learning in marine mollusks. It charts
              changes in  specific cellular mechanisms of learning in a specific behavior  in
              several species of these animals. By monitoring in parallel  correlated changes
              in learning capabilities, this study will  provide more precise insights into
              the roles of these cellular  mechanisms in learning. Besides the knowledge of
              whether and how  mechanisms of learning change across species, this work will
              also  give insights into learning mechanisms in higher animals.
