Abstract    :
              The World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are the cutting edge communication
              environments for engineering and science, and are fast becoming the environment
              of choice for education innovators in other disciplines as well.  This project
              will construct on the WWW an Ethics Center for Science and Engineering.  The
              center will serve as a model web ethics center, demonstrating the potential of
              the web to bring  together a variety of existing materials and make them
              available to a diverse population of users.  The subject matter will include
              research ethics, professional ethics for engineers and scientists, and policy
              questions that bear on research ethics and professional ethics,   including
              questions of research ethics which arise in medical research.  The WWW Ethics
              Center will serve students, practitioners, researchers, and science and
              engineering instructors, as well as scholars in science and engineering ethics.
               The Center will provide support for developing responses to ethical problems; 
              information and informed reflection on the ethical issues that commonly arise
              in engineering and science; access to educational resources in science and
              engineering ethics; and a forum for educators to disseminate their educational
              innovations.
