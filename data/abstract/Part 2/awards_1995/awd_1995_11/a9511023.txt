Abstract    :
               This research is the American part of an ongoing project in 22 countries to
              collect comparable survey data on key social issues and processes.  In the
              present study, a national sample of adult respondents will be asked their
              feelings about issues related to natiolal identity and their views of the role
              of government.  Data on national identity will identify some of the subnational
              and supranational pressures that threaten the viability of states and test
              hypotheses about factors leading to order and stability.  Data on the role of
              government will provide continuity with earlier studies and will allow the
              tracking of changes in the attitudes of citizens toward government.    %%%  
              Participation in the International Social Survey Program represents an
              important part of the leadership role that the United States plays in
              international social science.  This research ensures the continuing
              availability of high quality cross-national data otherwise inaccessible to
              individual researchers.  The data also make an important contribution to
              teaching by providing graduate students with materials for theses and
              undergraduates with experience in analyzing data.
