Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal for the study of, "High Intensity  Laser-Atom
              Interactions", calls for a joint theoretical and  experimental study of atoms
              irradiated by intense optical  fields.  The experiments will focus on high
              harmonic  generation (HHG) and on ionization in intense, short optical  pulses.
               The measurements of harmonic coherence will be  extended and high-order
              harmonics will be used to begin a  new series of continuum saturation
              experiments.  Recent  findings on harmonic angular distributions will be
              extended  by re-imaging the harmonics which emerge from the focus,  measuring
              their spatial coherence using a Young's two-slit  interferometer, and making a
              high resolution study of the  angular spectral distribution.  Theoretical work
              will  continue to extract new information about strong-field  atomic behavior
              during MPI and high-harmonic generation.
