Abstract    :
              SBR-9511034  MATISOFF                                ABSTRACT                   
                            The Sino-Tibetan (ST) languages constitute one of the  great
              language families of the world. Yet despite the rapid  development of
              Sino-Tibetan studies in recent decades, they  remain poorly understood; indeed,
              some branches of the family are  still virtually unstudied. To fill this vacuum
              in historical  linguistic research, the STEDT (Sino-Tibetan Etymological 
              Dictionary and Thesaurus) project gatheres data from both extant  published
              works and the growing body of field work and  intergrates them into a coherent
              whole. The concrete goal of the  project is the publication of an etymological
              dictionary of the  ancestor language, Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), spoken perhaps 
              6000 years ago. The Dictionary is organized by semantic fields,  so it will
              constitute a "thesaurus" of PST.        A large computer database of
              etymological and lexicographic  information has been created to support the
              research required to  publish the Dictionary. This database consists of a
              lexical file  (containing at this time over l90,000 words in about 200 
              languages and dialects), an etyma file (containing over 2,400 
              reconstructions), and ancillary files containing references to  language names,
              bibliographic citations, extensive etymological  notes, and semantic diagrams.
              Sources for lexical data range from  published dictionaries and wordlists to
              questionnaires solicited  from fleld researchers. Along with the Dictionary,
              electronic and  hardcopy versions of materials supporting the reconstructions 
              will be published, including a directory of language names, a  compendium of
              phonological inventories, and detailed sound  correspondences in the form of a
              "sound law database."
