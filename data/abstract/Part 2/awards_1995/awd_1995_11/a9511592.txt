Abstract    :
              9511592  Raghavan  Description:  This proposal will support US  participation at
              the US-Indo Binational  Workshop on Game Theory & Economic  Applications,
              followed by the 2nd International  Conference in Game Theory, Bangalore, Jan
              2-6,  1996.  Each of the co-organizers, T.E.S.  Raghavan and T. Parthasarathy,
              are responsible  for having developed important centers for game  theory
              research at their respective  institutions, the University of Illinois at 
              Chicago and the Indian Statistical Institute.   This year is notable, with the 
              Nobel Prize in  economics having been awarded to three  distinguished game
              theorists for their  contribution to understanding economies as  models of
              non-cooperative games.      One of the main thrusts of the conference will  be
              the recent developments on equilibrium  selection and economic models of games
              with  incomplete information in bargaining, auctions  and competitive bidding. 
                Scope:  Game theory is an area in which there  is a strong basis for
              collaborative research  between Indian and US mathematicians and  economists. 
              This workshop will build on the  accomplishments of a highly successful game 
              theory conference that was supported by INT  just over five years ago.  It will
              focus on the  major advances in the analysis of strategic  behavior embodied in
              the theory of games.   India's Finance Minister, the Honorable  Manmohan Singh,
              and operations researchers from  US multinational corporations located in India
               will report on problems particular to the  Indian setting that can be studied
              from a game  theoretic perspective.   ***                        /
