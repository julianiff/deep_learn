Abstract    :
              An international network of three gravitational wave  detectors is now in
              operation.  Each detector has an  individual noise level of approximately 6 x
              10-19 in  gravitational strain, and the detectors are in coordinated  operation
              to look for coincident detection of gravitational  waves.  The LSU group plans
              continued operation of its  detector in conjunction with the detectors from the
              Italian  groups and the Australian group.  Studies will be performed  on the
              effects of signal-to-noise ratio on the estimates of  time of arrival of a
              gravitational wave pulse.  Continued  operation in coincidence with these other
              detectors will  look for gravitational wave pulses of amplitudes 10-18 or 
              smaller.  If none are seen, the lower limit of gravitational  flux will be
              extended to lower values.    R&D will be done on the continued development of
              the  resonator-transducer-amplifier that has been responsible for  the
              outstanding performance of the LSU antenna.  This will  involve continuation of
              the collaboration with the  University of Maryland to develop robust and
              sensitive SQUID  amplifiers for resonant transducers.  In addition, there  will
              be continued development of the TIGA advanced detector  concept developed by
              this group.
