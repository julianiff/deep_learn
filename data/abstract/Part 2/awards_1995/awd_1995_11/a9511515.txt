Abstract    :
                 This project supports the ethnographic research by a team of 3
              anthropologists and 5 student research assistants in Dade County, Florida on
              minority school performance and orientation.  The study will assess the social
              capital of students' families and communities in five disadvantaged groups:
              Native-born African-American, immigrant Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and
              Mexicans living in 3 neighborhoods of Dade County.  Using in-depth ethnographic
              methods of intensive interviews, focus and `rap` groups, and participant
              observation in schools, homes and communities, the project will explore the
              interrelations between family structure, social class, gender, and migration
              history.  Students representing `positive` and `adversarial` orientations
              towards education from each ethnic group will be chosen for long-term study.  
              This research is important because education is the fundamental source of human
              capital which makes for productive citizenship.  Understanding the sources of
              variation within broad ethnic categories -- why some disadvantaged young people
              take full advantage of their educational opportunities while others seemingly
              from the same backgrounds and circumstances spurn them -- is the most promising
              strategy to advance our understanding of workable designs for intervention and
              improvement.
