Abstract    :
              Nagle  9511773      Small protein molecules or peptides, play an important role
              in  communication between cells in the brain.  The synthesis of these  peptides
              is a complex task involving the excision of the peptide  from a larger
              precursor molecule by specific enzymes.  Moreover,  these peptides must be
              compartmentalized or packaged in the brain  in such away that they can be
              released upon stimulation of the  brain cell.  To accomplish this release, the
              larger precursor  molecules and the enzymes to process the precusor must be
              co-stored  so the information transmitting peptide can be cut from the larger 
              molecule and released between cells.  However, how this packaging  of material
              is accomplished remains unknown.  Dr. Nagle will use a  well-established system
              to investigate how the enzymes responsible  for cleaving these peptides from
              their precursors is accomplished.   It is anticipated that these studies will
              also identify specific  domains in the enzymes responsible for targeting the 
              peptide-containing precursors and enzymes to the appropriate  secretory
              apparatus.  These studies are of fundamental importance  in understanding the
              transfer of information between cells.  The  findings from these studies are
              applicable to cells in the brain,  as well as peripheral tissues.  More
              importantly, however, these  studies provide information on the biochemical
              basis by which  information is transmitted between cells in the nervous system
              or  the basis of the way the brain functions.
