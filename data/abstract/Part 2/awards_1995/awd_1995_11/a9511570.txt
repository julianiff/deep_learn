Abstract    :
              The goal of the research is to understand the behavior of  excited state atoms
              in electromagnetic fields.  Stark and  Floquet spectroscopy are employed to
              measure atomic  polarizabilities and atomic hyperpolarizabilities and a 
              program measuring the photoionization cross section of two  electron atoms has
              recently begun using funds from an NSF  ARI grant.
