Abstract    :
              9511750  Zygourakis  This  project  is  on  research to further develop  a 
              model  for  migration and proliferation of anchorage-dependent cells that  is 
              based  on  the  concept of cellular automata.  The current  model  takes into
              account cell motility and contact inhibition, involves  no   fitted  
              parameters,  and  has  excellent   agreement   with  experimental  data.  The
              proposed model extension  involves:  (1)  Cells   of  different  type  and 
              shape;  (2)  Coupling  with   a  receptor/ligand  model which will describe
              endocytic  trafficking  and cellular responses; (3) The ability to handle
              co-cultures  of  more than one type; and (4) Cell growth in multiple layers, i.
              e.  a  three  dimensional  model.  In addition,  this  research  will  improve
              the sensitivity of cell motility assays.  ***
