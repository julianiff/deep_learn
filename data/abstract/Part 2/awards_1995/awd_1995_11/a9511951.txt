Abstract    :
              This is a new proposal for studying, Physics with ultra-cold  Molecules".   the
              work calls for developing a general method  for cooling and trapping any
              paramagnetic molecule or atom.  This would create a new area of molecular
              physics whose  impact can be expected to be comparable to, or possibly  greater
              than, the study of ultra-cold atoms in atomic  physics.  The technique is
              applicable to paramagnetic atoms  and molecules  with a magnetic moment of one
              Bohr magneton  or larger and does not rely on any particular energy level 
              pattern.
