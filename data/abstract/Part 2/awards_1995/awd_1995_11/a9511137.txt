Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. Camerer (SBR-9511001).  The PIs
              propose to   study iterated rationality in the context of economic game theory.
               Iterated rationality   refers to the belief that others are rational, that
              others believe that you are rational, that   you believe that others believe
              that you are rational, etc.  Iterated rationality is a central   assumption of
              game-theoretic analyses that have been applied to a large number of   phenomena
              in economics, psychology, and other social sciences.  Since the empirical  
              basis for this assumption is weak, the PIs plan to examine it in several ways. 
              First, they   will use a  numbers game  in which the estimate of a winning
              number by a contestant   reveals to what extent that contestant believes in
              iterated rationality.  Second, they will   use variations of the numbers game
              in order to determine which changes in the procedure   foster more rational
              choices.  Such procedural changes will provide clues as to subjects   
              assumptions about the rationality of their opponents.  Third, the PIs will
              examine   participants with various characteristics, such as group homogeneity
              or experience with   the numbers game, in order to determine what factors
              influence participants  rationality.    Finally the PIs will examine whether
              what a participant learns about rationality in one   game transfers to a
              different game.
