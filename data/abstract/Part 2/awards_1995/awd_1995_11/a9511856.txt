Abstract    :
                This is a project to study the phonetic and phonological elements of Central
              Alaskan Yupik postlexical prosody; their distribution with respect to each
              other and with respect to independently motivated syntactic and discourse
              structures; and their meaning, i.e., their pragmatic value and their use in
              framing naturally occurring speech of various kinds.   Project work involves:
              (a) two 3-week field trips to Chevak, Alaska, a village where a particular
              dialect of Central Alaskan Yupik is spoken, in order to construct and record
              sets of utterances in which potentially independent determinants of postlexical
              prosody are systematically varied, and to examine prosodic usage in
              already-existing recordings from Chevak of oral literature and other speech;
              (b) instrumental and other linguistic analysis of both elicited and
              naturalistic recordings at the P.I.'s home base; and (c) a period of writing
              leading to a book on the project's topic.   The project is expected to have
              significance for (a) the documentation and description of Central Alaskan
              Yupik, a language that is rapidly becoming moribund as fewer and fewer children
              learn it; (b) the theory of postlexical prosody, by contributing a case study
              and by exploring the idea that syntax, discourse structure, and interpretation
              directly determine the distributions of individual prosodic elements; (c)
              prosodic methodology, by establishing the importance of studying distribution
              and use side by side, using quantitative data from both repetitive elicitation
              and natural discourse; and (d) the promotion (via the foregoing) of research on
              a wide range of languages, especially those studied in the 'field' and faced
              with imminent extinction.
