Abstract    :
              9511583  Huber       Research will be carried out in muon-catalyzed fusion, 
              specifically on the formation rates of molecular muon-hydrogen-  hydrogen
              systems for different isotopes of hydrogen and the  importance of molecular
              resonances which greatly enhance the  molecular formation process. 
              Experimental work will be carried  out at the TRIUMF laboratory in Canada.  A
              computer simulation  code will be written and applied to analysis of the data 
              produced.  Research in this areas will advance our understanding  of the
              molecular processes involved, with possible application of  this technology to
              more precise tests of quantum electrodynamics,  low energy tests of quantum
              chromodynamics, and extending to  future development of an intense source of
              neutrons for testing  materials and, more speculatively, to large-scale energy 
              production.  Education of undergraduate students is a central  component of
              this grant.***
