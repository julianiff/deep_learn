Abstract    :
              The spatial model of electoral competition first proposed by Anthony Downs and
              subsequently extended by many authors is a core part of formal political
              theory.  It has been and is currently used to study a wide variety of electoral
              processes and political institutions and its properties under many alternative
              conditions are now well known.  All of this work, however, maintains the
              assumption that voters' preferences are exogenously given and can be treated as
              fixed while studying the behavior of competing parties and candidates.  This
              makes all the resulting predictions conditional on this assumption.  Empirical
              studies of voter preferences, by contrast, have connected changes in
              preferences to the platforms and actions of competing parties and candidates. 
              The proposed research will connect these two literatures by developing a model
              of electoral competition that makes preferences endogenous, meaning that they
              co-evolve with party platforms during the election process.  The model will
              then be explored to ascertain its implications for the existence of stable
              outcomes, for the ability to predict these outcomes based on initial conditions
              and assumptions about party behavior, and for its dynamic properties.  The
              assumption of fixed preferences can be treated as a special case of this
              general model.
