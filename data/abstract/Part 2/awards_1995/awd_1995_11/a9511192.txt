Abstract    :
              9511192  Petratos       Research will be carried out in high energy electron 
              scattering reactions centered on the study of (1) nucleon charge, 
              magnetization, and spin structure, and (2) the short-range  structure of
              few-nucleon systems.  Research in these areas will  advance our understanding
              of the quark and gluon structure of  these systems.  These topics are high
              priority activities in  contemporary nuclear physics.  The work will be carried
              out at  the SLAC and CEBAF electron accelerator laboratories.  Development,
              construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-  art equipment, including
              a plastic scintillator hodoscope for the  CEBAF Hall A spectrometer, is
              integral to this activity.  Education of graduate and undergraduate students
              and postdocs is  a strong component in every aspect of this grant for this Kent
               State University researcher.  ***
