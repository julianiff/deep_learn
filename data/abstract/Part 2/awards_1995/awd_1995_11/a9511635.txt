Abstract    :
                  Kesner  9511635    Memories are stored in the brain at several different
              locations.  Presumably, different brain regions are involved in storing
              different types or attributes of memory.  With this award Dr. Kesner will
              analyze the importance of several different brain structures (hippocampus,
              entorhinal cortex, parietal cortex, visual cortex, temporal cortex) to tasks
              requiring different types of memory storage.  These studies will test the idea
              that each brain area has a different involvement in memory that is related to
              specific attributes that each region is specialized to store.  This work will
              provide important baseline data necessary for detailed physiological studies of
              the mechanisms of  learning and memory in different brain areas.  ***
