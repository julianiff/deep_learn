Abstract    :
              This project explores sources and secondary materials to examine the historical
              participation of ecologists in addressing whether and how the science should
              produce results of immediate applicability to human problems.  It examines the
              nature and uses of the distinction between basic and applied science in
              ecology.  Taking as its endpoint a pivotal article, `The Sustainable Biosphere
              Initiative` (SBI), published in the scientific journal Ecology in 1991, the
              research will examine the theoretical, ideological, methodological and
              political conditions that underlie the discussions between ecological
              scientists about the nature of their science, the need for scientific autonomy,
              and the relationship of the science to social decisions and environmental
              outcomes.  The investigator will study the extensive archives of the Ecological
              Society of America at the University of Georgia, Athens, which contain the
              long-term records of ecological debates.  Two episodes will be particularly
              illuminating:  the development of systems ecology as 'applied science' and the
              debate among ecologists over a scheme of certification.  Several articles and
              plans for further research should result from this award.
