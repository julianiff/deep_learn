Abstract    :
              New firm creation is a vital element of technological innovation,  job creation,
              and economic growth.  While research has shown that  new firms have grown to
              dominate industries like biotechnology,  computers, communications, and many
              others, relatively little is  known about how these firms are financed in their
              earliest  stages.  The optimal source of financing is likely to vary  depending
              upon the industry, the firm's stage of development, and  the time period
              observed.  The purpose of this project is to  collect data from 1553 firms that
              issued equity in an initial  public offering (IPO) between January 1, 1978 and
              December 31,  1987.  Registration documents filed with the SEC contain 
              information on the sources of financing, pre-IPO performance, and  pre-IPO
              investment patterns for companies that are planning to go  public in the near
              future.  Creating a database with this  information would be indispensable for
              future research on factors  affecting new firm financing and growth.    The
              collection of a large database on the financing history and  pre-public
              operating performance of private firms will create  numerous research
              opportunities.  Some of these topics include:  How do industry and firm
              specific characteristics interact to  determine the optimal source of capital? 
              How does firm  performance affect who gives firms their financing to grow?  How
               do the sources of financing affect the speed at which the firm  can grow? 
              Have there been secular changes in the sources of  financing over the time
              period?  Does the presence of a  professional investor, such as a venture
              capitalist, improve the  pre-public performance of a company compared to a firm
              that has  not received venture capital financing?  These are only a few of  the
              questions that the data can address.
