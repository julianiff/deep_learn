Abstract    :
                9511637  Sejnowski    Recently a new field of engineering has emerged,
              referred to as neuromorphic engineering, that is based on the design and
              fabrication of artificial neural systems, such as vision chips, head-eye
              systems, and roving robots, whose architecture and design principles are based
              on those of biological nervous systems. A two-week workshop on neuromorphic
              engineering will be held to bring together young investigators and more
              established researchers from academia with their counterparts in industry and
              national laboratories, working on both neurobiological as well as engineering
              aspects of sensory systems and sensory-motor integration. Formal lectures will
              be given, but the primary focus will be hands-on experience with research tools
              for all participants. The workshop will serve as a bridge between the
              engineering world of artificial neural systems and the neuroscience community.
              The workshop will provide an environment for intensive interactions between
              members of these two communities - merging engineering principles with
              experimental results from neuroscience. The interaction of these two
              disciplines should have significant impact both on the development of new
              technologies (new artificial neural systems) and on our understanding of how
              the nervous system is designed.   ??
