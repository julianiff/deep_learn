Abstract    :
                9511521  Smeeding    The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database consists of
              comparable  microdata on the composition of households and the structure of 
              their cash incomes for 23 industrialized economies as of December  1994.  LIS
              standardizes these data and makes them available  through electronic mail. 
              These data are used by over 300  researchers worldwide to analyze economic and
              social policy and  its effect on such topics as income structure, poverty and
              income  inequality, and wage and earnings differentials by education  level and
              by gender.  Regular activities such as biennial  meetings and summer workshops,
              are combined with intermittent  conferences and meetings involving the
              database.  Over the past  seven years, the LIS project has demonstrated its
              feasibility and  usefulness as an internationally sponsored and researcher-lead
               database project.  It is unique in its approach to funding in  that the
              majority of its support, and all of its "core'  operations, are funded by a
              consortium of 18 nations.  Because  electronic access to LIS is, by design and
              intent, free once a  privacy pledge is signed, many users treat it as a "public
              good"  which provides benefits at little or no direct cost to them.   This
              grant provides renewed funding for the United States core  contribution to LIS.
