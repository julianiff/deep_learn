Abstract    :
                     This study examines the causes and consequences of gender segregation in
              the workplace.  It draws on theories in cognitive social psychology,
              institutional organizational theory, and labor economics to construct
              hypotheses about the conditions affecting individuals, jobs, organizations, and
              their environments.  Multiple data sources will be examined, including a unique
              data set made up of class action suits relating to gender discrimination. 
              Statistical models are used to assess the following questions: 1) why the
              gender composition of jobs varies within and across organizations, 2) the
              mechanisms through which the gender composition of jobs influence earnings and
              career advancement, and 3) the relationship among gender, job segregation, and
              work effort.  %%%   This research explores the ways organizational structures
              and processes shape labor market outcomes for men and women.  It will search
              new empirical sources for evidence to contribute to the continuing debate on
              gender segregation in the workplace.  It will also clarify the impact of Equal
              Opportunity legislation on labor market dynamics.
