Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to examine the apparent discrepancy between the
              pro-environmental   attitudes that people express and the less than
              pro-environmental behaviors that people   perform.  The PIs propose to perform
              four  streams  of experiments to examine this   issue.  In the first stream of
              experiments the PIs will examine preference reversals in   environmental
              domains.  The hypothesis is that when persons evaluate a single option,   they
              tend to focus on what they want rather than what they think they should do. 
              When   choosing between two or more options, people switch their mode of
              decision making   toward what they perceive they should do.  In the second
              stream of experimentation, the   PIs will explore the self-enhancement biases
              that allow people to escape blame from   behaving in ways that are detrimental
              to the environment.  In the third stream of studies   the PIs will explore
              egocentrism in the arena of environmental decision making.  By   interpreting
              information in a self-serving manner, persons can act in an exploitative way  
              toward the environment and toward each other and still feel that they have
              behaved   appropriately.  Finally the PIs will explore the area of generation
              discounting--the means   by which people evaluate the relative importance of
              their current consumption relative to   the welfare of subsequent generations.
