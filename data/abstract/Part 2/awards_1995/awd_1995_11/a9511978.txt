Abstract    :
              9511978  Lamb  Description:  This proposal requests support  for a joint
              workshop on "Active Galactic  Nuclei, Dense Stellar Systems, and Galactic 
              Environments", to be held at the Inter-  University Centre for Astronomy and 
              Astrophysics(IUCAA), Pune, India.  The workshop  will bring together a number
              of leading  astronomers from the US, the UK and India  having expertise in
              component areas present in  galaxies which affect galactic nuclei and the 
              possible production of Active Galactic  Nuclei(AGN).  The workshop will bring
              together  researchers in traditionally disconnected areas  of research who are
              interested in exploring the  symbiotic relationships contributing to the 
              structure and dynamics of AGN.  The aim of the  workshop is to explore why
              'activity' occurs  uniquely in the nuclei of the galaxies and to  interpret the
              many varied observations of AGN.   The workshop is being organized by Susan
              Lamb  (University of Illinois), Judith Perry  (Institute of Astronomy,
              Cambridge), and Jayant  Narlikar (Director of IUCAA, Pune, India).  Scope:  The
              workshop, by providing a forum on  the various elements of the AGN puzzle, is 
              intended to further cooperative research on the  galactic context of nuclear
              activity and to  include leading Indian researchers in  trinational
              collaborations. Considering the  inter-disciplinary expertise of the 
              participants, the workshop will have high  educational value for participants
              as well as  for the young Indian students of Astronomy.   Proceedings of the
              workshop including review  articles and contributed papers will be  published.
