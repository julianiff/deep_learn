Abstract    :
              9511890  Levitt  Crime is an important social and economic issue in the United
              States.  The cost of crime to victims is estimated at approximately $200
              billion per year.  In addition to that figure, government outlays on the
              criminal justice system totaled $74 billion in 1990 and private expenditures on
              protection are the same order of magnitude.  Given the scope of the crime
              problem, the empirical economics literature addressing the issue is
              surprisingly small.  This project focuses on finding creative apppoaches to
              identifying the effects of policy changes in the presence of simultaneity
              between crime and the policy variables of interest.  More specifically, it
              considers 1) the effect of police on crime; 2) the impact of prison populations
              on criminal activity; and 3) relationship between arrest rates and crime.   
              For example, previous empirical studies have typically uncovered little
              evidence that additional police officers reduce crime.  One problem with those
              studies is a failure to adequately deal with the simultaneity between policy
              and crime: while police may or may not reduce crime, there is little doubt that
              expenditures on police forces are an increasing function of the crime rate. 
              This study uses the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial elections as an
              instrument to break the simultaneity between policy and crime.  Increases in
              the size of police forces disproportionately occur in election years, but there
              is little reason to expect that elections affect crime except through changes
              in the police force.
