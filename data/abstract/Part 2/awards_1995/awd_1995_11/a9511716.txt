Abstract    :
              9511716  Khoury  This action will provide partial support for a meeting to 
              study "Physics Graduate Education for Diverse Career  Options", which will be
              sponsored by the American  Association of Physics Teachers and the American
              Physical  Society.  The attendees will be mainly the chairs of physics 
              departments from a broad range of universities and colleges.  Other
              participants and speakers will come from non-academic  and industrial
              enterprises that customarily hire Ph.D.'s in  physics.  ***
