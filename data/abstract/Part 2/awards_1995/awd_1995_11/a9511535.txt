Abstract    :
              Andreas Ortmann  SBR-9511535    This proposal was submitted under the Career
              Development Program.  The research plan is to extend prior experimental work on
              symmetric bargaining and coordination games.  In particular, Dr. Ortmann will
              study the effect of re-scaling, payoff perturbations, and pre-play
              communication on the behavior of the experimental subjects in games in which
              the risk and payoff dominant strategies differ.  In previous work by the P.I.
              re-scaling of the payoffs was found to have a substantial impact on subject
              behavior, even though it does not alter either the risk dominant or payoff
              dominant strategies.  The goal of the educational plan is to make game theory
              and experimental economics an integral part of the liberal arts curriculum.  To
              do this Dr. Ortmann proposes to alter the introductory principles and
              intermediate economic theory courses and create a new interdisciplinary major
              in organizational science.
