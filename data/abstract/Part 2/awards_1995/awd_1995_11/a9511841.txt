Abstract    :
              Production of Videotape for Ethics Training of  Students.  This project will
              produce a play and a videotape of the play for widespread use in classroom
              instruction on science ethics.  The play will address the most significant
              ethical problems in science, including falsification of data, ownership of
              intellectual information, harassment, and other problems which plague all of
              our scientific establishments.  The play has been read and used in its script
              form at numerous universities and annual meetings of professional societies,
              and has the potential for being widely used in ethics training programs as
              mandated by the NIH and perhaps by other governmental agencies.  More
              specifically, the objective of this proposed project is to produce the play,
              using drama department personnel and facilities, and to videotape the
              production for dissemination to the widest possible audience.  A workbook
              consisting of historical material and discussion questions will accompany the
              videotape.  The videotape will be tested, revised, and made available through
              professional organizations and appropriate newsletters.  A demonstration will
              be conducted at the earliest meeting of the Association for Practical and
              Professional Ethics.
