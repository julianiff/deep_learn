Abstract    :
              9511344  Ferrie    Despite enormous changes in both the characteristics of
              immigrants and the character of the U.S. economy they have entered, little
              evidence has been available to assess how their economic mobility has changed
              over long periods of  U.S. history.  We lack a historical benchmark since
              adequate information on the economic mobility of Americans has been unavailable
              for the mid-nineteenth century.  Published data from the decennial censuses of
              population for this period allow examination of only broad aggregates: net
              migration flows, the distribution of occupations at a particular place or point
              in time, and the average level of wealth in various communities.  Where
              specific mid-nineteenth century immigrants and natives went, how they changed
              jobs over the course of their careers, how successful they were in monetary
              terms as those changes occurred, and how immigrants' economic performance
              changed as their time in the U.S. increased have remained a mystery.  This
              project uses two new longitudinal samples of ante-bellum immigrants and natives
              followed through the federal censuses of 1850 and 1860 to help fill this gap. 
              It documents the extent of economic mobility among immigrants and natives in
              the years before the Civil War.  A variety of sources provide comparable
              information on economic mobility in the late nineteenth and twentieth
              centuries.  The reports of the Immigration Commission (1911) and Public Use
              Micro Samples from the 1900-10 and 1970-90 federal census of population provide
              cross-section information on the number of years immigrants have spent in the
              U.S., making it possible to see how the economic performance of immigrants
              compares to that of natives as immigrants' time in the U.S. increases.      
              This project provides a historical perspective on the economic mobility of
              immigrants and natives in the U.S. over nearly a century and a half of economic
              development.  It assesses the relative economic performance of immigrants and
              natives in three periods: 1850-70, 1880-1 910, and 1970-90.  The study will
              examine changes in income, occupational attainment, and wealth using data on
              time since arrival, career histories, and information on the performance of
              parents and children.  This will make it possible to assess how the relative
              performance of immigrants and natives has changed over long periods of time and
              to learn how much of the change in relative performance has resulted from
              structural changes in the U.S. and world economies and how much has resulted
              from changes in the legal restrictions placed upon immigration.  Answers to
              these questions are particularly relevant when the role of immigrants in the
              U.S. economy is under greater scrutiny than at any time since the Immigration
              Commission's Report of 1911 which prompted the imposition of the quota system.
