Abstract    :
                9511765  Willis    Many  animals,  from  spawning  salmon  to  hungry 
              seabirds  and  insects,  locate distant unseen resources (such as  food  or 
              the  salmon's  home stream) by using odors released by that  resource.  These 
              investigators  study the male moth, Manduca  sexta,  which  locates  mates  by
              flying upwind in a trail of the sex-attractant  odor (pheromones) released by
              receptive females.  The male moth's  flight is guided by combining information
              from all of its senses,  including smell, vision, and touch. To explore how the
              male moths  adapt  their  behavior to changes in their environment,  such  as 
              changing wind speed or odor concentration, male moths are  video-  taped  while
              flying freely toward the pheromones in a  laboratory  wind  tunnel and activity
              from their flight muscles is  recorded.  In  this  way,  control signals from
              the nervous  system  can  be  correlated with the behavior that is videotaped.
              The results from  these  free-flight studies can then be compared to  results 
              from  tethered   male  moths  provided  with  computer-driven   sensory 
              stimulation from a flight simulator and tethered males using  the  muscle 
              activity patterns generated in the moth's nervous  system  to  drive  the 
              computerized flight simulator. This  will  enable  these  investigators  to
              analyze how the  moth's  nervous  system  combines the information from all of
              its senses with the on-going  behavior  patterns that underlie this complex
              behavior.  Finally,  computer simulations of odor-guided flight in moths will
              be  used  to   test  hypotheses  about  how  the  nervous  system  controls 
              behavior. Knowledge derived from these studies can them  be  used  to  design
              artificial systems that could perform similar adaptive  control functions.
