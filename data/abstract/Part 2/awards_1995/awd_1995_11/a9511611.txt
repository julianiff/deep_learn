Abstract    :
              SBR-9511611  Krassimira Paskaleva  Philip Shapira  Georgia Institute of
              Technology    Privatization, Regional Development, and Democratization in
              Bulgaria    The research investigates the relationships among privatization of
              economic activities, local and regional networks of organizations, and the
              development of new economic and political structures in post-communist
              Bulgaria. The research draws on theoretical debates about the relationship
              between economic and political change in post-communist countries, and about
              the importance of networks and quasi-private institutions in regional economic
              development.  The Veliko Tarnovo region in north-central Bulgaria was chosen as
              the focus region, because it has a strong historical identity as a region, is
              distant enough from Sofia to have a distinct economy and institutions, and has
              avoided the acrimonious political discord of the capital.  Thus, the
              investigators expect the region to be among Bulgaria's prime candidates to
              develop indigenous institutions to promote competitive private enterprise. 
              Data are to be drawn from archival sources and structured interviews, making
              use of the investigators' prior work in Bulgaria and fluency in Bulgarian.  The
              project will test the much-discussed contributions of sub-national, regional
              networking and cooperation to economic development, in a very different
              political and institutional context than most of the published literature.
