Abstract    :
              9511516  Hiltner    This award provides funding for a collaborative effort
              ("TIE"  project) between two Industry/University Cooperative Research  Centers.
               The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  (I/UCRC) for Sensors and
              Actuators (BSAC) will be developing an  Acoustic Microsensor to be mounted on
              plastic and composite test  panels for space applications by the I/UCRC for
              Applied Polymers  (CAPRI).    The I/UCRC for Sensors and Actuators at the
              University of  California, Berkeley will build upon its experience to develop
              and  evaluate an advanced micro-acoustic sensor for detecting and  monitoring
              space particle impact in low earth orbit.    The sensors will be mounted on
              plastic and composite panels by the  I/UCRC for Applied Polymers at Case
              Western Reserve University for  space flight tests on the materials flight
              experiment carrier,  MFLEX.    The researchers are internationally recognized
              scientists and are  well qualified to perform this project.    The Program
              Manager recommends Case Western Reserve University be  awarded $50,000 for two
              years for this "TIE" project with the  University of California, Berkeley.
