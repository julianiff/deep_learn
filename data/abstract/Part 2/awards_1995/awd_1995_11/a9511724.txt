Abstract    :
              Style is a pivotal construct in theories of sociolinguistic variation, for it is
              the locus of the individual' s internalization of broader social distributions
              of variation. A robust theory of speech style is essential for theories of
              variation, and for all work dealing with natural speech data, which requires
              accountability in the elicitation and analysis of speech samples. Practice in
              the field of variation has been based on a relatively unanalyzed model of
              style, adequate for the elicitation and analysis of intraspeaker variation in
              the context of sound change in progress. However, as social theories of
              variation become more intricate, they require a more sophisticated treatment of
              style. In recent years several models of stylistic variation have developed
              that hold great promise for the advancement of the field. However, each of
              these theories is partial, and synthesis requires intensive collaboration.   A
              two-day workshop will bring together researchers from several fields and
              several continents, who have separately done work on speech style but have been
              unable to spend concentrated collaborative time. The aim of the workshop is to
              bring their findings and theories together and develop common goals and
              hypotheses for a new phase of research.
