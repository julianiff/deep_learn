Abstract    :
                  The behavior of an organism is a set of characters that is just  as critical
              to the understanding of biology as the morphological  and physiological
              features of the individual. Statistically  robust description of behavioral
              processes is, unfortunately,  more difficult to obtain than in the more
              traditional fields of  biology. Especially when the task is to indicate the
              occurrence  of subtle behavioral changes, merely counting the number or 
              duration of a behavior pattern is insufficient. Recent  applications of
              Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) models to  Ethology have shown great
              promise as a descriptive and  hypothesis-testing tool. Researchers have
              indicated otherwise  undetectable changes of sub-threshold doses of
              amphetamines and  electrical stimulation of the brain. Unfortunately, many of
              the  statistical techniques available are poorly suited for fitting  CTMC
              models to behavior for a variety of reasons such as high  alpha error rates,
              inability to deal with normally encountered  sample sizes, number of ties and
              censored observations, and the  need to have computationally simple solutions
              that can be used as  standard PC-based routines.    This project will consider
              the design and implementation of  generalizations of the CTMC model. In
              particular, while the  transition times in such models usually follow simple
              exponential  distributions, this project will examine the possibility that 
              these times follow a distribution with nonconstant,  piecewise-constant hazard
              rates. The goal is to create  computationally efficient, unbiased, robust
              statistical  techniques to fit such models, paying special attention to 
              estimation of, and inference on, the time or times when the  hazard rate
              changes. These techniques will then be evaluated by  testing them on both
              actual and simulated data sets.
