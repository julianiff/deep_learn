Abstract    :
                9511721  DeWeerth    Humans and animals move around in their environments with
              seeming  ease.  To design better robotic devices, engineers would like  to 
              capture  the  design  principles that animals  use.  This  in  an 
              interdisciplinary project between engineers, computer  scientists  and 
              biologist directed at gaining a better understanding of  the  ways  animals 
              control movement, by studying the  neural  systems  that  generate swimming
              motion in fish and other simple  animals.  This research will consist both of
              studying the nervous system of  the particular animals and of modeling the
              behaviors generated by  these  systems. The circuits in the nervous systems 
              that  create  the  observed  patterns  of movement, even  in  these  relatively
               simple animals are very complex. Therefore, the research of these 
              investigators  will  focus  on the  design  of  very  large-scale  integrated 
              (VLSI)  circuits that emulate  the  function  of  the  biology. These complex
              artificial circuits make it much easier to  create  neuron firing patterns in
              real time that are very similar  to  those found in their biological
              counterparts. The end goal of  this research is to develop a better
              understanding of the biology  while  learning  how  to  better engineer 
              systems  that  perform  complex tasks that can currently only be performed by
              humans  and  other animals.
