Abstract    :
              9512868  Polenske    This award supports collaboration between Dr. Karen 
              Polenske, MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and  Professor Chen
              Xikang, Institute of Systems Science, Chinese  Academy of Sciences, Beijing,
              China on research on the  effects of alternative technologies on energy and
              pollution.  The study will investigate the principal energy-efficiency 
              improvements being undertaken in the electricity generating  sector of the PRC
              as well as assess the economic effects of  alternative technologies on energy
              and pollution in the  household sector.  The project has immediate importance
              for  global energy use and pollution reduction, given the  magnitude and rapid
              urbanization of China's population and  the brisk growth of the national
              economy.
