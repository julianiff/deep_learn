Abstract    :
              9511838  Elser    This Americas Program award will support travel and related 
              expenses for eleven  U.S. scientists and five graduate  students, to
              participate in a joint U.S./Mexico workshop to  be held in Guaymas, Mexico. 
              Organizers are Dr. James Elser,  Arizona State University, and Dr. Edward
              Pfeiler, Instituto  Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), 
              Sonora, Mexico.  The workshop will focus on the  environmental biology of the
              coastal Sonoran region as a  step towards increasing scientific exchange
              between U.S. and  Mexican scientists in this ecologically diverse desert-ocean 
              landscape.    The potential for transnational and global environmental 
              disruptions, including climate change, pollutant transport  across
              international boundaries, and biodiversity loss, has  increased with the global
              economy.  This potential is  especially strong in the environmentally sensitive
              and  economically dynamic U.S.-Mexico boundary region and calls  for increased
              international scientific exchanges in the area  of basic and applied
              environmental biology.  This workshop  will bring together senior scientists,
              and students from  both the U.S. and Mexico, to identify research questions of 
              mutual interest for future investigations.  ***
