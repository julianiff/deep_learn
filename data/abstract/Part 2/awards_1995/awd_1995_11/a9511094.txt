Abstract    :
                 Information is passed from cell to cell in the brain by functional contacts
              called synapses.  The rate, pattern and precise timing of those signals
              represent aspects of coding by the nerve cell that brings information to the
              synaptic junction, and so is called the pre-synaptic neuron.  The transmission
              to the post-synaptic neuron then determines the pattern of activity of that
              neuron in turn.  The synaptic transmission is not perfect, but has some factor
              of reliability, so that a sequence of pre-synaptic nerve impulses turnq into
              some sequence of post-synaptic responses that may not be identical.  This
              project utilizes a preparation of an isolated slice of brain tissue from the
              visual cortex, as a model system where individual neurons can be visualized
              under the microscope while electrophysiologically recording their signals.  
              Recordings are made simultaneously from connected pairs of neurons, identified
              by injected fluorescent tracers.  Results will give estimates of the
              reliability of this important stage of visual cortical processing, and will be
              important to the current controversy about bursting and oscillating activity in
              areas of the cortex.  These studies will have an impact not only on visual
              neuroscience, but also on general aspects of synaptic function, computational
              neuroscience, our understanding of cortical organization and perception, and
              even on understanding mechanisms of learning.
