Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative proposal with George Loewenstein of Carnegie-Mellon
              University   (SBR-9520891).  The PIs propose to investigate the lack of
              personal consistency in   patience across choice situations.  The authors
              hypothesize that traditional economic   discounting models are inadequate to
              explain such inconsistency.  Instead the PIs propose   that temporarily high
              discount rates are promoted by situations in which transient factors  
              influence the desirability of choice alternatives.  Such factors include drive
              states and   emotions, for example. The following four hypotheses encompass
              their theory.  First,   changes in immediate transient factors have a greater
              impact on behavior than changes in   delayed transient factors.  Second, our
              actual response to a transient factor is greater than   anticipated.  Third, we
              underestimate the impact of future transient factors on our future   behavior. 
              Fourth, people underestimate the impact of transient factors on the behavior of
                other persons.  The authors propose to do four studies, each of which will
              manipulate a   transient factor.  The basic paradigm is to offer participants a
              choice of an inferior option   now or a superior one later.  The PIs will
              observe how the choice behavior is influenced   by varying the transient
              motivation for the options.
