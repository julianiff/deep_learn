Abstract    :
              This collaborative research grant supports the incremental linkage costs of a US
              team, led by Prof. Peter Woodhead, of the Marine Sciences Research Center,
              SUNY/Stony Brook, to work in Namibia, to investigate the ecology, physiology
              and behavior of cape hake, Merluccius capensis, in relation to oxygen
              depletion.  These studies of cape hake, the dominant demersal fish in the
              Benguela upwelling system, where depletion of oxygen from bottom waters is
              prevalent, will advance knowledge concerning the responses of fish to hypoxia
              in the open sea.  The collaborating foreign institution is the National Marine
              Research and Information Center (NATMRIC) of Namibia. Two oceanographers from
              the Marine Science Research Center at SUNY/Stony Brook, with two graduate
              students, will travel to Namibia to take part in two cruises with their
              counterparts in August and October 1995, and again in 1996.  This proposal
              offers very good complementarity of resources between the US and foreign
              partners, and gives two US graduate students international field research
              experience. Of  the three senior US sc ientists, two are women.  Cooperation
              with the Namibian host institution allows access not otherwise possible for the
              US investigators.  The Namibians are providing the ship time. The Namibian
              scientists have broad expertise in the fisheries of the Benguela current
              system, but they have lacked equipment and experience for relating changes in
              fish abundance and distribution to critical environmental variables.  The Stony
              Brook scientists bring strengths in the latter, including assessment of effects
              of oxygen depletion on marine communities.  The joint research will provide
              information critical to management and conservation of marine resources.
