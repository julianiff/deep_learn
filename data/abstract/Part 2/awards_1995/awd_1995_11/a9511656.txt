Abstract    :
              Akins, Chana  IBN-9511656                              Abstract    Reproductive
              behavior is central to the evolutionary biology  of organisms, and learning
              experiences have been shown to  influence various aspects of reproductive
              behavior.  One  learning mechanism that animals use to predict biologically 
              significant events is Pavlovian conditioning.  For example,  an animal may
              learn, via Pavlovian conditioning, to predict  food, an encounter with a
              predator, or access to a potential  mate.  The anticipatory conditioned
              responses that animals  make may enable them to optimize their interaction with
              a  subsequently presented biologically significant event (an  unconditioned
              stimulus or US).    Conditioned stimuli paired with US's such as food, water, 
              and mating opportunity come to elicit orienting, approach  and search
              responses.  Obtaining food, water or a  reproductive opportunity can be a long
              complicated process  involving a sequence of many different behavior patterns. 
              For example, under certain conditions, the mating behavior  of male quail may
              be similar to general search behavior,  characterized by increased locomotor
              activity.  Other  conditions may evoke more direct approach behavior to cues 
              that signal a mating opportunity.  Dr. Akins' research will  provide
              information about the circumstances that evoke  various conditioned responses
              and about the mechanisms of  those responses in reproductive behavior systems. 
              Furthermore, the results of this investigation will  contribute to our
              knowledge of the generality of learning  processes in social behavior and the
              importance of  predictability in social situations.
