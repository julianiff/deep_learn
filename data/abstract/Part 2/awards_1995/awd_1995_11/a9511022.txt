Abstract    :
              The probability that a person with mental illness will commit a violent act has
              important legal implications.  Premilinary work shows that clinicians  assessed
              probabilities of violence were highly sensitive to the manner in which they
              were elicited, resulting in great inconsistency.  Unless probabilities are
              consistent, they cannot have an adequate degree of correspondence to actual
              events in the world and cannot convey appropriate information about the
              potential for future events, such as the likelihood that an individual will
              cause harm.  Using experienced clinicians to judge the probability that a
              mental patient will commit a violent act, this research seeks to:  (1) identify
              the underlying causes of inconsistencies in clinicians  probability assessments
              of factors relevant to involuntary hospitalization in mental health law, (2)
              investigate the effectiveness of an alternative method of probability
              assessment to reduce scale inconsistency, and (3) examine the effects of task
              structure and training in probability on the consistency of clinicians 
              probability assessments.
