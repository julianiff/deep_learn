Abstract    :
              IBN-9511262  Van den Pol, Anthony      The hypothalamus is a primary regulatory
              center in the brain,  controlling everything from the endocrine milieu to body 
              temperature, circadian rhythms, and food and water intake.   Emerging results
              suggest that glutamate, a fast-acting excitatory  chemical messenger, plays an
              important role in neuroendocrine  regulation by acting within the hypothalamus.
                A member of the  peptide class of messenger molecules called neuropeptide Y
              (NPY)  acts more slowly than glutamate.  NPY appears to be involved in 
              numerous hypothalamic functions including food intake,  reproduction, and
              circadian rhythms.  A great deal is known about  the effects of NPY, but little
              is known about the mechanisms used  by NPY to generate these effects.  Dr. Van
              den Pol proposes to use  several different experimental systems to determine
              the mechanisms  by which NPY modulates glutamate function in the hypothalamus. 
              He  will investigate the electrophysiological effects of glutamate and  the
              modulatory actions of NPY on hypothalamic neurons.  Dr. Van den  Pol will use
              anatomical procedures to identify the projections of  NPY and glutamate
              containing neurons within the hypothalamus  revealing unique anatomical
              features of these cells.  The  modulation of a fast amino acid transmitter by a
              peptide, while  examined in the hypothalamus, has broad ramifications
              throughout  neuroscience.  The proposed studies will increase our understanding
               of the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of NPY action and  ultimately,
              will aid our understanding and treatment of a wide  range of neurological
              disorders.
