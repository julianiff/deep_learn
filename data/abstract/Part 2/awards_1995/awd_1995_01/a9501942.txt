Abstract    :
                This project is in the area of computational biology;  specifically, problems
              which deal with how to construct  evolutionary trees, or  phylogeny, (i.e.,
              models of the  evolutionary history of various species).  There are three 
              standard criteria on which tree construction algorithms are  based:  distance
              methods, maximum likelihood, and parsimony.  The first two  methods are used by
              the biologists and are dealt  with in the statistical  literature.  The
              traditional algorithms  literature for tree construction is  focused on the
              parsimony  methods; notably the Perfect Phylogeny Problem.  Although this 
              problem has significant combinatorial appeal, there is a gap  between the
              results for this algorithmic theory and the theory  for distance  based tree
              construction methods.   The project focuses on problems in the  distance based
              phylogeny,  including: (1) Methods for computing  distances from strings; (2)
              Methods for comparing different trees for  consensus; (3) Methods for fitting
              distance data to metric models.    The  second part of the project involves
              developing empirical  methods for testing  the statistical robustness of
              heuristic  methods currently in use.    The  Educational Component of this
              CAREER Grant includes: (a) Development and  implementation of a post doctoral
              training program in computational molecular  biology at  DIMACS; (b)
              Modification of the graduate seminar in  biocomputing; (c) Development and
              modification of the Rutgers University  undergraduate program in biomathematics
              which focuses on  combinatorics and  molecular biology.
