Abstract    :
              DMS-9501516  Rothschild/Baouendi    The investigators will study the geometry of
              real submanifolds in complex space. In particular, they will focus on geometric
              and analytic invariants of these manifolds under holomorphic changes of
              coordinates.  Special consideration will be given to those manifolds globally
              defined by real polynomial equations.  For many manifolds defined by the
              vanishing of real polynomials, any component of a holomorphic transformation
              from one such manifold to another must also be a root of a complex polynomial. 
                Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural
              outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear
              early on that the theory differed  widely from it predecessor.  The underlying
              geometry was far more  difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more
              affinity  with partial differential operators of first order.  It thus grew  as
              a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and
              differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in
              the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding
              these basic  mathematical forms.
