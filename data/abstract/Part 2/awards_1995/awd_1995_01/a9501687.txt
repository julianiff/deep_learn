Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  This study examines the intersection among state policies,
              type of economy, and the family in affecting occupational sex segregation. 
              Theoretical issues relate to gender stratification and the effects of
              institutional arrangments.  Data are from national censuses between 1960 and 
              1990 in the United States, Sweden, Japan, and Hungary.  The four countries have
              been selected because they are expected to display four distinct patterns of
              sex segregation.    %%%   This research will contribute to sociological
              understanding of how state policies affect the segregation of occupations
              according to the sex of workers as well as the ways in which women deal with
              competing obligations from work and family.  The results should be useful to
              policy makers concerned with equal opportunity for women and support for the
              family.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,
              this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing
              research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future
              scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next
              generation of social scientists.
