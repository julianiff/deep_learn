Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9501835  Kay, Laura    This award is made under the auspices of the
              NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program.  As a CAREER awardee the
              investigator is expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to her
              scientific research project.      Optical spectropolarimetry is a powerful
              technique for studying the wavelength dependence of the polarization of
              continuum and spectral line radiation in astronomical objects.  Dr. Kay uses
              this technique to investigate the nature of active galactic nuclei (AGN).  She
              will observe a class of broad-line radio galaxies with double-peaked emission
              lines that are suggestive of the presence of accretion disks.  High quality
              spectropolarimetric data of such objects could add support to accretion disk
              models of AGN.  Within her education effort, Dr. Kay will place special
              emphasis on involving women undergraduates at her institution in research.
