Abstract    :
                PI: Manfredi  DMS-9501561    Manfredi will investigate the interplay between
              nonlinear elasticity and function theory.  He will attempt to bridge the gap
              between quasiregular mappings and mappings describing deformations of certain
              types of hyperelastic materials.  Regularity up to the boundary of solutions to
              nonlinear elliptic systems that appear often in applications to non-Newtonian
              fluid mechanics will also be discussed.  The significance of this research is
              the interconnections between areas of classical analysis and materials science.
                 Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
              physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about
              the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these
              approximations.
