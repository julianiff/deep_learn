Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT    Greiner  CTS-9501502  U/Nevada-Reno    This work will provide
              experimental data and numerical modeling for the heat transfer and pumping
              power in passages with transverse grooves. Such grooves have been shown to
              augment heat transfer without a commensurate increase in pressure drop, a
              long-sought-after effect, as in most cases the increase in heat transfer
              effectiveness is overridden by high pumping costs to overcome the commensurate
              increase in pressure drop.  Applications are in compact heat exchangers for
              aircraft and other high-density heat transfer equipment and in industrial scale
              heat exchange equipment.
