Abstract    :
              This award supports research on the analysis of the algebraic structure of
              non-standard quantum groups.  The specific aims of the project are: (1) To
              analyze in detail the algebraic structure of the Cremmer-Gervais quantum groups
              along the lines of previous work of Hodges and Levasseur on the standard and
              multi-parameter cases; (2) To study the structure of the associated Poisson
              groups and Lie bialgebras and to compare this with the structure of the
              associated quantum group; (3) To construct further families of non-standard
              quantum groups.  This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on
              it.  Although the additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the
              multiplicative operation is not required to do so.  An example of a ring for
              which multiplication in not commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over
              the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part
              of algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of
              mathematics and physics.
