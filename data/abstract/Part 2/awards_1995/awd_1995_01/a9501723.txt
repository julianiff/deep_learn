Abstract    :
              9501723  Bayer    This awards supports the research of Professor D. Bayer to
              work  on  methods for computing in both algebraic geometry and topology. In 
              algebraic geometry he will focus on the connections between toric  varieties
              and integer programming. In topology he will study  methods to compute on
              3-manifolds. He hopes to use the interplay  between topology and algebraic
              geometry such as the  interpretation  of the Haken normal surface as a Hilbert
              basis for a polyhedral  cone. Finally he proposes to develop virtual reality
              software for  direct manipulation of 3-manifolds.    The research starts out in
              algebraic geometry and then moves on  to  topology. Both are among the oldest
              parts of modern mathematics,  but both have blossomed to the point where they
              have, in the past  10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. 
              Originally, Algebraic Geometry treated figures defined in the  plane  by the
              simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the  field  uses methods not
              only from algebra, but also from analysis and  topology, and conversely it is
              extensively used in those fields,  but it has applications to many areas of
              engineering as well.   The  research supported in the present proposal shows
              the importance  of  this once purely theoretical area for robotics and
              manufacturing.  Topology studies the properties of objects that are invariant 
              under  transformations that do not tear the surface. It is extensively  used in
              such areas as Physics and Chemistry where the shapes of  objects are
              fundamental to determine their properties.  ***
