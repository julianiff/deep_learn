Abstract    :
              There is an intimate relationship between the algorithms used in  communication
              and magnetic storage systems, the integrated circuits  (ICs) which implement
              the algorithms, and the system performance  which results.  As systems increase
              in complexity, trade-offs and  innovations need to be made at all levels of a
              system design in  order to drive system/circuit performance to approach
              fundamental  limits. This research is pursuing teaching and research plans
              which  have the goal of developing students into engineers prepared to  make
              significant and important technical contributions to the  development of high
              performance communication and magnetic storage  systems.    On the side of
              teaching, the goal is to develop a curriculum which  encourages students to
              make connections between both the  theoretical and practical aspects of
              electrical engineering. The  curriculum needs formal methods to bring out the
              synergy that  exists between these two aspects of their field. On the side of 
              research, the fundamental theme is to examine algorithms and  architectures
              important in communications applications, identify  performance or speed
              limitations of conventional implementations of  the algorithms and
              architectures from an IC implementation  perspective, develop ways in which
              modifications may result in  implementation advantages, and prototype the new
              approaches in  order to demonstrate its potential advantages. Proposed projects
               include the development of analog, digital, and mixed-signal ICs  for wireless
              satellite and infra-red, wired LAN, and magnetic disk  read channel
              applications.
