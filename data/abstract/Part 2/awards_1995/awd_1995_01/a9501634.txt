Abstract    :
              Pinto   9501634  This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty Early
              Career Development (CAREER) program.  As a CAREER awardee the investigator is
              expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his scientific
              research project.  Supernovae are the largest (well-observed) explosions in
              astrophysics.  They act as laboratories for the study of hydrodynamics, are the
              dominant driver of galactic chemical evolution and, if used with careful
              corrections, may be used as large-scale cosmic distance indicators.  Pinto will
              improve his supernova atmosphere computer code, which is used to model spectra
              and light curves of supernovae at all energies from gamma rays through the far
              infrared.  With the improvements the model code will be used for studies in all
              of the areas mentioned above.  The education component of the planned research
              includes teaching several   undergraduate and graduate courses, including
              setting up a computer laboratory with specialized software for astronomy
              undergraduates and non-majors to use in conjunction with their astronomy
              classes.   ***
