Abstract    :
              NCR-9501452  Goldsmith, Andrea      The broad goal of this research is to
              address fundamental issues in  the design, analysis, and implementation of
              wireless networks.   Issues treated will cross traditional boundaries between
              signal  processing, communications, and networking.  The work will first 
              develop a networking, architecture and protocol suite to support  the
              internetworking of wireless subnetworks.  A hierarchical  network
              infrastructure will be considered that exploits the  broadcast capability and
              power control of radio channels.  Optimum location of multimode gateways and
              hierarchical databases  to aid in mobility management and routing within this 
              infrastructure will be determined.  Optimization techniques for  efficient
              allocation of spectrum will be studied using techniques  from dynamic
              programming. Formal methods for obtaining and  analyzing channel policies will
              be developed and applied  to analysis and design issues.  Joint source/channel
              coding  techniques to minimize end to end distortion will be examined.  
              Emerging wireless applications will be considered and a global  networking
              infrastructure to support these applications will be  sought.  The education
              component will develop innovative and  dynamic course programs at the
              undergraduate and graduate level in  wireless communications, networks, and
              dynamic programming. These  activities will encourage industrial
              collaborations.
