Abstract    :
              The  evolution  of  geometric and photometric  attributes  of  2D 
              organizational structures can not only provide evidence  for  the  underlying 
              structure  and motion but  also  help  infer  complex  motions.  This  research
              will develop a computational  theory  to  extract  structural  and  motion 
              information  from  long   image  sequences  by  exploiting  perceptual
              organizational  principles.  Simple motions will be grouped to infer about
              complex motion.  An  efficient  computational framework will be developed  to 
              monitor  the  evolution of the organizational structures. Detection of the  2-D
              organizations isbased on graph theory and voting methods, and  a  modification
              of Bayesian networks. These 2D organizations  are  then  tracked  through the
              image sequence to generate  traces  of  their  photometric and geometric
              properties. This  research  will  open up possibilities for the development of
              new tools for motion  understanding using organizational principles.
