Abstract    :
                  Compile-time type information is believed to be very valuable in efficient  
              compilation of functional languages such as Standard ML. But little is known  
              on how to support type-directed compilation in real compilers and how much  
              performance gain one can get from various type-based optimizations. The goal  
              of this research is to design and identify important type-directed compilation 
              techniques that can significantly improve the performance of ML programs.  
              These new compilation techniques are expected to lead to the following nice  
              results: (1) data objects (including recursive data structures) in ML programs 
              will be able to use unboxed data representations that are as efficient as  
              those in C programs; (2) polymorphic functions and parametrized modules will  
              be implemented efficiently through cross-module type specialization and  
              inlining expansion; (3) type information propagated into the compiler back end 
              will be used to assist program analysis such as closure analysis and  
              instruction scheduling.  The educational component of this CAREER award seeks
              two  objectives: the construction of a new compiler lab kit (based on the  
              above type-based ML compiler) and the incorporation of state-of-the-art  
              compiler technology into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum.
