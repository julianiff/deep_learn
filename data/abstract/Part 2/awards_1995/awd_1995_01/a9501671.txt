Abstract    :
              9501671  Urban    This funding is to support a planning meeting and associated 
              activities for North Dakota State University to determine an  industrially
              relevant research agenda and industry's potential to  support such an agenda in
              the coatings industry.  The planning  meeting will explore the potential for
              North Dakota State  University to become a partner in Eastern Michigan
              University's  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Coatings.   
              The North Dakota State University researchers are recognized  experts in
              coatings and well qualified to undertake this project.    This award has been
              coordinated with Dr. Norm Bikalis MPS/DMR and  Dr. Robert Powell of the
              Chemical and Thermal Systems Division in  engineering.    The Program Manager
              recommends North Dakota State University be  awarded $10,000 for one year.
