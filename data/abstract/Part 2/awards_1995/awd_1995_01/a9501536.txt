Abstract    :
              9501536  Verardo    This project will refine a new method to extract charcoal
              from  marine sediments.  Existing methods cannot distinguish charcoal  from
              other refractory organic material, such as coal, pollen,  kerogens, and lignin.
               If the method is successful, it can be used  to address a variety of
              environmentally important problems, such as  the past extent of biomass
              burning, carbon transfer between the  land and oceans, and the long-term cycle
              of carbon.
