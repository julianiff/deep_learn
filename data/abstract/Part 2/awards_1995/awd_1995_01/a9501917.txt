Abstract    :
              9501917  Skjellum  This works seeks to elaborate the two main areas of long-term
              commitment by the Principle Investigator (PI): parallel scientific
              algorithm/library design, and message-passing mechanisms for high performance
              distributed computing.  As applications drive requirements for high-performance
              libraries, and services (like message passing, parallel I/O), so a strong
              vertical integration of application, libraries, and services presents itself.
              This research will be unique and of importance because it works to manage the
              complexity and integration of applications, libraries, and services while
              considering portability and performance.
