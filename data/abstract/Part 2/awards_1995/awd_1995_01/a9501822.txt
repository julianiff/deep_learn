Abstract    :
                 This CAREER award supports research in methods and tools  for  performance
              prediction of parallel programs.  The goal is a tool  set that  incorporates
              general and accurate methods to predict the  performance of a  parallel
              application in advance of its  execution.  The approach taken is based  on
              prior work that has  built tools to measure the performance of parallel 
              programs  (Predicate Profiling) and automatically construct performance  models
               of existing applications (Lost Cycles Analysis).  While  the prior work has 
              relied principally on dynamic whole-program  analysis, this research will add 
              static analysis techniques and  apply dynamic tools to program fragments.  By 
              applying those  tools to program fragments, the research seeks a flexible
              method  for the performance prediction of alternative program structures.  The
              resulting  tool is expected to aid computational scientists  attempting to tune
              the  performance of programs running on high  performance, massively parallel 
              architectures.    The educational component of this CAREER award addresses 
              course  development and teaching of parallel processing for  undergraduates, 
              performance measurement and prediction for  graduate students, and a new 
              approach to introductory computer  science for freshmen.
