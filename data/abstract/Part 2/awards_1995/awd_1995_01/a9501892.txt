Abstract    :
              ***  Johnson  9501892     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project seeks to develop novel materials for use in photocatalytic destruction
              of organic contaminents in air, water and on surfaces. The research objectives
              are to develop non-oxidizable ambient-temperature binders for photocatalytic
              TiO2; enhance destruction rates of target compounds using tailored surface
              coatings; demonstrate commercially useful self-cleaning, biocidal clear coats;
              and show that photocatalytic reactions produce no undesirable byproducts.  
              Target applications of the technology include treatment of industrial air
              emissions, destruction of chlorinated organics in drinking water, and
              self-cleaning, mildewcidal and bactericidal architectural paints and clear
              coats. Spin-off applications that are envisioned include clean rooms for
              semiconductor manufacturing and control of fruit ripening.  ***
