Abstract    :
              9501580  Burr       This project will collaborate with French scientists to 
              drill coral terraces in the western tropical Pacific.  Three  sites will span
              the center and southern margins of the Western  Pacific Warm Pool, and will be
              drilled to about 30,000 yr BP.  Samples will be analyzed for stable isotopes,
              U, Sr and  radiocarbon.  The project will address two objectives; (1) a  record
              of warm pool thermal stability at several scales of  climate change (with
              implications for circum-Pacific climate) and  (2) calibration of the
              radiocarbon age scale (relevant to all  science which depends on radiocarbon
              dating).  ***
