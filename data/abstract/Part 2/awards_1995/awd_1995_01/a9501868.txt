Abstract    :
              This award supports research in number theory and representation theory.  The
              principal investigator will work on determining the poles of standard
              intertwining operators attached to arbitrary maximal parabolic subgroups of
              quasi-split unitary groups and special orthogonal groups in odd dimensions.  He
              will also continue research on the tempered spectrum of similitude groups. This
              award also supports the principal investigators efforts to establish a series
              of courses in number theory and representation theory.    Number Theory is the
              study of properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
              mathematics.  From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished the
              driving force to create new mathematics in almost all parts of the discipline. 
              The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with
              calculus.  Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but has had
              astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding
              theory.
