Abstract    :
              9501897  Yasbin  The 39th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
              Procaryotic Genetics, is being held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes, Park,
              Colorado, June 7-11, 1995.  This conference is primarily concerned with the
              biology of genetic exchange systems and the genetics of a variety of
              procaryotic and eukaryotic systems: it is the major annually occurring meeting
              devoted to this subject area.  One significant feature of these meetings is
              their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose
              travel funds frequently are limited.   Funds are being provided for travel and
              support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and
              post-doctoral students working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic
              genetics.  %%%  This is the major meeting held annually in the United States
              where the genetics of a wide variety of bacteria are discussed.  ***
