Abstract    :
              In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Phillip Grandinetti   of
              Ohio State University will apply recently developed two dimensional   NMR
              techniques and Dynamic Angle Spinning to characterize structures in   silicate
              glasses.  Structural distributions in alkali and alkaline   network modified
              silicate glasses will also be studied to quantify   changes in angle
              distributions, non-bridging oxygen environments, and   silicate species
              distributions as functions of composition.  This   information will be used to
              refine potential functions used in molecular   dynamics simulation studies of
              the structure and dynamics of glasses.    The educational component of this
              program will focus on improving   faculty-student contact in the general
              chemistry course, using a database   to help instructors identify students with
              difficulties and implement   strategies for improvement, and developing new
              courses in NMR and Data   Acquisition and Analysis.  The design and preparation
              of glasses is made difficult by the lack of   sound theoretical models relating
              composition and structure to   properties.  Professor Grandinetti will use NMR
              techniques to provide   experimental structural data which can confirm the
              basis of theoretical   models and improve their predictive capabilities.  Such
              information will   also be of value in NMR studies of related systems such as
              ceramics,   catalysts, and biopolymers.
