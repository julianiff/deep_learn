Abstract    :
                  9501567  Powers  This is an award to provide the support this investigator 
              requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  which has the intent of encouraging
              the early development of  academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The
              research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our 
              understanding of nonaqueous phase liquid entrapment and  dissolution processes
              in heterogeneous subsurface systems, to  formulate conduct mathematical models
              and experimentally verify  them to test hypotheses descriptive of the
              dissolution processes.  Her education plan involves using the results of the 
              research to  formulate open ended problems and using them as a basis for 
              providing experiential learning opportunities for students.    Results are
              expected to provide a more fundamental understanding  of phenomena associated
              with movement of nonaqueous fluids  through porous media than now exists
              leading to an improvement in  models used in engineering design of remediation
              processes and  systems for decontamination of soils contaminated with these 
              types of fluids.  The teaching plan this investigator plans to  pursue is
              likely to produce innovations in the use of computer  programs as tools for
              engineering analysis and design.  ***
