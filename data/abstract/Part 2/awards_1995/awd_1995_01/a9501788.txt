Abstract    :
              Barsony    9501788  This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) program.  As a CAREER awardee the
              investigator is expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to her
              scientific research project.  Understanding how stars form has great
              ramifications for understanding formation of stellar systems at all scales,
              from planetary system formation through large-scale structure of the Universe. 
              Barsony will study star formation from three perspectives -- to determine the
              initial conditions for star formation, to characterize the earliest
              observationally recognizable protostellar state, and to try to understand the
              mechanisms leading to molecular cloud fragmentation and thus the formation of
              star clusters.  These projects rely on observations over a broad range of
              wavelengths --  millimeter, submillimeter, and near infrared.  The education
              plan includes developing new courses: Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy for
              undergraduates and graduate classes including Radiative Processes in
              Astrophysics, Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics and Readings from Current
              Astrophysics Research.  Also an undergraduate physics computing facility will
              be set up so that computers can be directly integrated into the teaching of
              undergraduate physics classes.   ***
