Abstract    :
              United States scholars have assumed world leadership in all the specialized
              fields that reflect the interests of philosophers of science.  This grant
              provides travel support for US philosophers of science to represent the United
              States scholarly community in the Xth International Congress of Logic,
              Methodology, and Philosophy of Science to be held in Florence Italy in August,
              1995.  The Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) has handled travel grants
              for previous International Congresses and will do so again with this grant.  A
              committee established by the PSA governing board will make recommendations for
              distribution of the travel funds.  Grants will be restricted to those
              presenting papers, having other active scholarly roles or with official duties.
               Efforts are being made to assure that all disciplines in the philosophy of
              science are represented, that women and men participate at appropriate
              proportionate levels, and that worthy young scholars will have an opportunity
              to attend the meeting.  Grants provide assistance for air travel on U.S. flag
              carriers between the United States and Italy only.  Grants do not provide
              ground travel, per diem expenses, or registration fees.
