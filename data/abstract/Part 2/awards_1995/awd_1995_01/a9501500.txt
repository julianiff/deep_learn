Abstract    :
              Professor Gillet will continue his work on Arekelov theory and  algebraic
              K-theory. He wishes to study non-archimedean Arekelov  theory. He also intends
              to study the connections between K-theory  and motives in particular to use
              motives to construct a K-theory  with compact support.    This project falls
              into the general area of arithmetic geometry -  a subject that blends two of
              the oldest areas of mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination
              has proved  extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that 
              withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error  correcting
              codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern  computers (hard disks) and
              compact disks.
