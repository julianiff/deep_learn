Abstract    :
              9501507  Knyazev    This project will study preconditioned iterative methods for
               computing   several extreme eigenpairs of generalized eigenvalue problems, 
              with very   large symmetric matrices.  Such problems are of major importance 
              in many   grand challenge scientific and engineering applications:  structural
              dynamics   and buckling, ocean modeling, quantum chemistry, and   
              magnetohydrodynamics. They arise typically from the  discretization of  
              continuous models, described by systems of partial differential  equations.  
              Matrices may be so large that the standard numerical methods  become  
              unsatisfactory and cannot be implemented even on the most  powerful   modern
              supercomputers as they are too slow or require too much  memory.   
              Preconditioned iterative methods were specially designed for  problems of  
              that kind and now they are well understood for solving large  ill-conditioned  
              linear algebraic systems of equations. For eigenproblems the  theory is still  
              poor, and these methods are rarely used. Ideally, the methods  would   compute
              well-separated clusters of eigenvalues and corresponding   eigenspaces at the
              same order of computational cost as that for  solution of   the corresponding
              linear algebraic system. Such processes can be  effective   and 
              parallelizable. Domain decomposition and iterative  substructuring   methods
              are  particularly promising.    The ultimate goal of the research is to develop
              a complete theory  of the   preconditioned methods now known for symmetric
              eigenproblems and  to   find new fast, accurate, and robust iterative methods.
              This would  provide a   basis for the development of advanced software and
              algorithms on  high   performance parallel computing systems. It is expected
              that a  research   monograph on preconditioned iterative methods for large
              symmetric    eigenvalue problems will be prepared to summarize the results of 
              the   project.
