Abstract    :
              9501906  Culver  This is an award to provide the support this investigator 
              requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  which has the intent of encouraging
              the early development of  academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The
              research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward establishing an
               efficient optimal design algorithm for decontamination of water  in aquifers
              that have been contaminated with hazardous materials.  The investigator's
              education plan involves development of  effective skills for teaching
              engineering courses and to use  those skills to enrich courses she will be
              responsible for  teaching.  Her goal is to bring students to a level of 
              understanding that allows them to analyze problems relating to  decontamination
              of aquifers and to design appropriative  engineering solutions to those
              problems.    Results of this investigator's research are likely to improve the 
              approaches taken toward engineering design of procedures for  decontaminating
              groundwater.  Her teaching plan is expected to  result in increased
              participation in engineering by women and  under-represented minorities.  ***
