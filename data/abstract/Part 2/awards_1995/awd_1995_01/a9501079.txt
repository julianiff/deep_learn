Abstract    :
              9501079  Udwadia    This US-Hungary workshop on "Dynamics and Control" will take
               place on July 24-26, 1995, in Sopron, Hungary, with combined  sponsorship of
              the National Science Foundation, the Hungarian  Academy of Sciences, and the
              International Institute for Applied  Systems Analysis (IIASA).  The organizers
              are Dr. Firdaus Udwadia  of the University of Southern California, Dr. Miklos
              Farkos of  the Technical University of Budapest, and Dr. Arkadii  Kryazhimskii,
              representing IIASA.    Researchers attending this workshop will deliver
              presentations  and discuss topics concerning the use of advanced methods in: 
              1) analytical dynamics and control, and 2) control of nonlinear  uncertain
              systems.  Their overall objective is to derive improved  mathematical models
              with more realistic predictions and determine  methods for engineering control
              actions that can be more robust  under uncertainties.  It is anticipated that
              this effort to bring  together scientists, engineers, and industrial technology
              experts  from the U.S. and Europe will yield ideas for longer-term  research
              projects that may lead to increased precision in  mathematical modeling of
              relevant phenomena so that newer models  can be made more realistic and more
              readily applicable to areas  such as environmental and biomechanical systems,
              where  uncertainties predominate.  ***
