Abstract    :
              9501877  Chang  A CAREER award will support development of research and 
              instruction in mixed-film lubrication theory and  experimentation.  The project
              will establish a strong  industry connection and will endeavour to provide 
              fundamental solutions to generic industrial problems in this  branch of
              tribology.  ***
