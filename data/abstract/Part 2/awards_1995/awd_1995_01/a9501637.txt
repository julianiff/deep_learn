Abstract    :
              9501637   Fujimoto    This award provides support for infrastructure at Georgia
              Institute of Technology in the form of three distributed laboratories where
              individuals at geographically distinct locations can interact with each other
              on-line using powerful, distributed computational  tools, to solve shared
              problems.  The infrastructure will include a multi-granular compute server and
              ATM switch, a video server with high-performance multi-media workstations, and
              network equipment.  The research topics to be explored include interactive
              steering, distributed simulations, collaborative systems; large-scale
              community, ATM and wireless networks.
