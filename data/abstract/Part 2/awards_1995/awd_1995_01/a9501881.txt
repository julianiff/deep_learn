Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Collicott  Purdue University  CTS-9501881    Experiments investigating
              internal cavitation and turbulence in steady and pulsed atomizing orifice flows
              will be conducted.  Applications of non-intrusive shortpulsed optical
              diagnostics are proposed to measure and observe cavitation and turbulence
              within small orifices.  The primary diagnostic tool will be a
              photochromicdye-based flow tagging method using a short-pulsed laser. 
              Cavitation in the orifice flows will be studied with short-pulsed image
              holography and a special orifice with gap dimension comparable with the
              dimensions of modern diesel fuel injector soifices.  Applications of this work
              includes modern multi-orifice diesel fuel injectors, spray pain and other
              coating application, and agricultural spray application.  The teaching plan
              consists of a new program with editorial and writing tasks.  A common stumbling
              block for engineering students is the need to transfer their mathematical
              knowledge from the equation-solving format of early courses to delicious, rich
              flavor to engineering.  A series of brief articles to coach students through
              this transition is envisioned.
