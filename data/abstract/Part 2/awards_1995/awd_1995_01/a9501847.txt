Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              CUNY.  The student will conduct a case study of a development project in
              Cochabamba, Bolivia, instituted by a German development agency.  Through
              intensive interviews, the student will examine the goals and objectives of the
              different actors in the project -- donors, administrators, experts, and the
              local people.  The PROSANA development project will be studied to describe how
              the values of the German donors and Bolivian intermediaries and subjects
              intermesh, compare and contrast.  By examining the development project as a
              process beginning in Germany and continuing in Bolivia, with interaction and
              back-and-forth negotiation instead of the simple picture of top-down
              development, the project will contribute a valuable case to the literature.  
              This research is important because it will add to the nation's expertise about
              this important region of the world through advanced training, and will extend
              our understanding of how economic development works as a process of negotiation
              between different cultural systems.  Increased understanding of the cultural
              component of development will help planners avoid mistakes based on fundamental
              misunderstandings and will be useful in designing programs that have greater
              chances of attaining their goals.
