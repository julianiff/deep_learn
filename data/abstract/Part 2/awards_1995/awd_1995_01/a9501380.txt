Abstract    :
                  This proposal is directed toward the continued operation of an  array of
              unattended, automatic magnetic data collection platforms  on the Greenland ice
              cap and the reduction, distribution and  analysis of these data.  The MAGIC
              array complements the magnetic  stations on the coasts of Greenland.  The MAGIC
              magnetic stations  form a two dimensional array with station separation of
              about 150  Km.  The scientific objective of these magnetic measurements is to 
              investigate, in conjunction with the coastal stations, small-scale  propagating
              magnetic disturbances which appear to result from  moving filamentary
              field-aligned currents interacting with the  ionosphere.  Different classes of
              these systems have now been  identified and the origin of the field-aligned
              currents appears to  be near the dayside magnetopause within the magnetospheric
              boundary  layer.  It is particularly important to have a dense two- 
              dimensional array in order to resolve the motion and structural  evolution of
              these current systems.  The Greenland stations in  combination with the other
              GEM funded stations deployed in Canada,  permit us to observe these phenomena
              over a sufficient region as to  identify their generation location and resolve
              their motion and  spatial evolution as the propagate.  These data and the
              proposed  research are important to understanding the physics of the  processes
              which couple energy and momentum from the solar wind to  the magnetosphere and
              ionosphere, the physics of the magnetospheric  boundary layer and the mapping
              of boundary layer phenomena to the  high-latitude ionosphere.
