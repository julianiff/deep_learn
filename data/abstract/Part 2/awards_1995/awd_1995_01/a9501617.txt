Abstract    :
              Jarvis   9501617    This is an award made under the CAREER program to Professor
              Tyler  Jarvis. This product has both an educational component and a  research
              component. The research will be to study the moduli  space of higher spin
              curves and of different compactifications of  the resulting moduli space. In
              particular he hopes to study the  moduli of line and vector bundles on
              degenerating curves. In  education he has two projects. The first is a rigorous
              study of  the effect of class size on students in introductory calculus and 
              the second is to develop a new abstract algebra course for junior  level
              students.    The mathematical research in this project falls into the general 
              area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the  oldest areas of
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This  combination has proved
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently  solved problems that withstood
              generations.  Among its many  consequences are new error correcting codes. 
              Such codes are  essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact 
              disks. The educational component falls into the broad area of  science
              curriculum reform which is vital if the nation is to meet  its need for
              scientifically trained adults.
