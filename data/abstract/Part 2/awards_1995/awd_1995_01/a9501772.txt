Abstract    :
              9501772  Gribb  Soil mechanics and groundwater flow courses at the 
              undergraduate level, and  often at the graduate level, rarely include in-depth 
              discussion of the  properties of unsaturated soils.  Without an understanding 
              of fluid  transport and strength and volume change behavior of  unsaturated
              soils,  engineers are not well equipped to effectively design  foundations for 
              expansive soils, predict slope stability of residual soils,  or characterize 
              the flow of contaminants in the vadose zone.  Historically,  complexities 
              associated with unsaturated flow equations have made  analytical solutions 
              difficult and limited to relatively simple problems.  New  computational 
              methods, powerful personal computers, and improved soil  instrumentation  have
              made it possible to investigate a larger scope of  problems, both  numerically
              and experimentally.  The two overall goals of  this project are:  1) to
              increase the knowledge base of unsaturated flow  behavior and 2) to 
              incorporate the topics of unsaturated soil mechanics and  unsaturated flow 
              into the civil engineering curriculum at the University of  South Carolina  to
              better meet changing needs of the profession and society.  ***
