Abstract    :
              9501239  Haller    Resonances are regions  in the phase space of a dynamical
              system in which the   frequencies of some angular variables become nearly
              commensurate. This proposal is   aimed toward the development and  application
              of new geometric methods for the study   of complicated dynamics near
              resonances. The main  goal is to capture invariant   structures in the phase
              space with a strong impact on the general evolution of the system.   Ideal
              candidates for such structures are hyperbolic  partially slow manifolds that
              arise in   many resonance problems and carry physically important motions with
              different time   scales. A subtle combination of regular and singular
              perturbation techniques can describe   this effect in detail by detecting
              remarkable families  of solutions connecting   neighborhoods of these
              manifolds. Such solutions describe repeated, complicated   transitions between
              physically distinguished motions    Many evolutionary processes in nature as
              solutions of sets of differential equations. Sets   of these solutions can be
              visualized as surfaces in some higher dimensional phase space   and irregular
              transitions between different states of the evolutionary system appear as  
              chaotic orbits connecting these surfaces. This proposal deals with the
              detection of such   transitions in the important and frequent case when the
              solution surfaces are composed of   solutions with several different time
              scales. The proposed mathematical techniques can be   used to  study yet
              unexplained details of molecular vibrations, patterns  of surface waves   in
              ocean dynamics, gravitational interactions of planetary systems, and chaotic  
              oscillations of engineering structures.
