Abstract    :
              9501541  Toutanji  This is a Career Development award.  The research plan 
              includes the investigation of the deterioration of fiber  reinforced plastics
              (FRP).  The studies will include  consideration of the fibers, the matrix or
              resin, and the  interfacial bond between fibers and matrix.  Durability will 
              be evaluated under wet-dry cycles, and freeze thaw cycles.  Fresh and sea water
              will be considered.    The education plan will include undergraduates in
              research  projects, integrate state-of-the-art computer programs and  have the
              students undergo practical, real world experiences.  Develop outreach services
              to the community involving  undergraduate and graduate students.  ***
