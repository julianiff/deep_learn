Abstract    :
              9501520  Feng       The primary focus of the research over the past few  years
              has been to develop new models and to utilize existing  models which are
              physically reasonable and computationally  feasible in order to correlate the
              multi-faceted aspects of  the structure of medium and heavy nuclei.  The aim is
              to  gain a comprehensive and profound understanding of nuclei in  regions of
              the N-Z landscape which are vital to our  understanding the evolution of the
              universe and which have  yet proven inaccessible to laboratories on earth.  The
               common thread is to build from the fundamental shell model,  the "standard
              model" in nuclear structure physics.  Specific  research directions include the
              development of the Drexel  University Shell-Model (DUSM) code as a numerical 
              implementation of the shell model; the Fermion Dynamical  Symmetry Model (FDSM)
              to study the collective aspects of  larger nuclei; a pseudo-spin pseudo-orbit
              model which aims  at a "grand unification" of low- and high-spin spectroscopy; 
              the projected shell-model, as well as a generalized pair  shell-model, to
              enhance our understanding of high-spin  physics and the collective behavior of
              nuclei; and the mean-  field Hartree-Fock approach, which addresses the global 
              properties of nuclei.  ***
