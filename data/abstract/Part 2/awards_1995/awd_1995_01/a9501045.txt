Abstract    :
              9501045  Kupiainen      The project  uses methods previously developed in
              Statistical   Mechanics for the study of dynamical systems with spatially  
              extended attractors. The first set of problems deals with  the formation of
              patterns and fronts in nonlinear parabolic PDE's.   The Renormalization Group
              will be used to study universal properties   of fronts and patterns in the
              Cahn-Hilliard and related equations.   The second set of problems deals with
              chaotic infinite   dimensional dynamics. Expansion methods will be used to
              study the   phenomena of spatio-temporal chaos and phase transitions in coupled
                map lattices and probabilistic cellular automata.      Extended dynamical
              systems model regular and chaotic   phenomena that are present in macroscopic
              systems   that are composed of a very large number of identical   parts such as
              liquids, gases and some biological and  ecological systems. Both the formation
              of regular   patterns (real life examples are waves in oceans, convective  
              phenomena in atmosphere and patterns in clouds) and  irregular, chaotic
              phenomena which exhibit chaos   as irregular behaviour both in time and in
              space (for example   turbulent motion of fluids) will be studied.  Previously
              developed methods   for problems in other areas of mathematical physics will be
              used to   study universal aspectsof these phenomena, i.e. aspects that are
              rather   insensitive to specific models that are being used.  ***
