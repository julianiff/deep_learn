Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  The research deals with the growing phenomenon of contingent
              work of four kinds: part-time, temporary, out-sourced, and independent
              contract.  It relates to theories of employment and labor force inequality.  A
              number of existing data sources will be used to compile a comprehensive data
              set for analyzing the determinants of contingent work and its effects on
              inequality.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding
              of  social stratification,  work, and economic sociology.   It will be of help
              to policy makers concerned with labor force inequality and employment policies.
                In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this
              award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research
              for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific
              manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of
              social scientists.
