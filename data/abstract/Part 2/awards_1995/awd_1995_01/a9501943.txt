Abstract    :
                The focus of this CAREER research proposal is the design,  semantics, and
              implementation of ATDCC, a language for a network  of  asynchronously
              communicating reactive programs.  Reactive  systems are tightly  coupled,
              event-driven systems that react  continuously with their environment at  a rate
              controlled by the  environment. Asynchronous systems are those in which 
              processes  are loosely coupled and communication can take arbitrary amount  of 
              time.  Complex applications, arising commonly in practice,  typically require 
              the combination of both these ideas, thus  motivating ATDCC.  ATDCC is expected
               to have the following  advantages: (1) support for hierarchical construction
              of  programs/specifications; (2) good foundational properties; (3)  efficient 
              implementation as a network of asynchronously  communicating automata; (4) 
              verification of safety properties,  including real time constraints.  This 
              research is aims towards  the creation of a complete programming environment
              for  modeling  and analyzing complex electro-mechanical systems.    This CAREER
               project includes active involvement in education, in  conjunction with the 
              research program.  The research program  itself involves the participation  of
              students, who will  benefit from the exposure to industrial  experience.  The 
              education plan includes course and curriculum development, for  both graduate
              and undergraduate students, incorporating current  research in the  general
              area of interest in the project.  An  undergraduate parallel programming 
              laboratory is planned to  collaborate, disseminate and share resources with 
              institutions in  the Chicago area.  The laboratory and curriculum development 
              are  intended to lead to undergraduate participation in research.
