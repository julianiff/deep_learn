Abstract    :
              The performance of an integrated circuit depends on the designers'  choices and
              the process engineers' decisions during the manufacture  of the device. 
              Typically the choices and decisions are independent  of each other with little
              awareness of the interplay of the two  engineering domains.    This research
              develops methods for raising the designers' awareness  of the effects of
              circuit implementation parameters and to  sensitize process engineers to the
              impact of processing decisions  on the performance of the final circuit.  A
              statistical model is  developed to correlate device and process parameters,
              primarily to  establish circuit performance variations on spatial and process 
              dependencies in replicated circuits.  Circuit simulators are used  to solve the
              resultant (huge) set of nollinear differential  equations.  JUSTIFICATION
