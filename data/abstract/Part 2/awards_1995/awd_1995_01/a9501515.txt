Abstract    :
              9501515  Chen  This research involves the study of an invariant (called chi
              invariant) of Alain Connes on von Neumann algebras. The connection between this
              invariant and the cohomology of groups will be explored. Of special interest is
              the cohomology theory of perfect groups. He will also use cohomology theory of
              continuous groups. One objective is to clarify the relations between the
              algebraic invariants associated with the chi invariant. Another objective is to
              realize the invariants for appropriate von Neumann algebras. Finally, a study
              will be made of the generalization of the chi invariant to bimodules. This
              invariant also plays an important role in the theory of subfactors.  The basis
              of the theory underlying this project is algebras of Hilbert space operators.
              Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.
              Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally
              called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have a variety of
              applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn
              is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming
              increasingly important in physics.  ***
