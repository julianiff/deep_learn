Abstract    :
              The  aim  of  the  proposed  research is to study how  autonomous  agents  can 
              adapt to dynamic  partially known task environments.  Potential applications of
              such agents range from hardware  robots  that  automate delivery chores to
              software programs that retrieve  information from the  Internet.  This research
              will focus  on  an  adaptive  control   paradigm called reinforcement 
              learning.   In  this  approach,  agents  acquire task skills  through  trial 
              and  error    by   selecting   actions    that   maximize   a   reward 
              function.Reinforcement learning has some  problems.  It converges  extremely
              slowly, especially in large  state space problems where  rewards  occur 
              infrequently. Also, the  learned skills  transfer  poorly  across  related
              tasks.  This  research  will  investigate  using  a  novel  modular  task 
              architecture  to  overcome  these  limitations of reinforcement learning. The 
              proposed architecture  decomposes composite multiple goal tasks into primitive 
              subtasks  that  achieve  each individual goal.  It utilizes  training  time 
              more   efficiently  by  dynamically  switching  between  learning  different 
              tasks  based on their difficulty and  importance.   It  increases transfer
              across tasks by reusing  solutions learned  to  primitive  subtasks  using a
              weighted linear  sum  function.   It  solves recurrent tasks more effectively
              by  using a reinforcement  learning  method  that  optimizes average   reward. 
               A  detailed  experimental  study  of  the  proposed   architecture   will   be
               undertaken, using a variety of simulated and real robot testbeds.
