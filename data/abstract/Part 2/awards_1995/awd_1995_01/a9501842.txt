              CTS-9501842   Joseph McGuire  Oregon State University          ABSTRACT      
              The project is an extension of current research in which site-directed mutants
              of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme are used to probe adsorption behavior. 
              Experimental techniques employed include in situ ellipsometry, radiolabeling
              and circular dichroism.  Simple kinetic models previously used to analyze
              single protein adsorption data will e extended to sequential and competitive
              adsorption of proteins.  The models allow two distinct protein states on the
              surface:  one exchangeable and one non-exchangeable.  The project is an attempt
              to model multi-state mechanisms of protein interfacial behavior in real
              systems.  Understanding the structure and role of proteins at interfaces is
              important in the development of bioseparations technology, fouling-resistant
              membranes, biocompatible materials, biosensors and related applications.
