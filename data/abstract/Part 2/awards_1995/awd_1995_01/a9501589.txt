Abstract    :
              The proposed project is focused on the theory, structure and design  methods for
              the perfect-reconstruction (PR) /ncar-perfect-  reconstruction (NPR) filter
              banks and their applications in signal  conversion, detection and adaptation. 
              High performance filter  banks with high attenuation are needed in many
              applications such as  audio compression algorithms, high-bandwith
              high-resolution A/D  converters, wideband signal detection systems and adaptive
               filtering algorithms.  The design of these filter banks are very  difficult
              because of the nonlinear relations between the parameters  and the objective
              function.  New structures and design methods will  be investigated.  They will
              open up new classes of filter banks,  some of which are addressed in the
              project.  They are the  biorthogonal cosine-modulated filter bank, the
              infinite-impulse-  response (IIR) cosine-modulated filter bank, and the
              nonuniform  filter bank.  These filter banks will be used in several 
              applications such as high-performance A/D converter, nondestructive 
              evaluation, echo cancellation and adaptive noise cancellation  systems.    The
              education part consists of writing an undergraduate textbook on  the theory and
              design methods of filter bank wavelets, establishing  an internet site for the
              storage of design programs and  coefficients of filter banks and developing a
              new course on time-  frequency and time-scale analysis.
