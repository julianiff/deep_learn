Abstract    :
              9501499  Vinnakota  This research is on analog circuit observer block (ACOB),
              structures for testing analog and mixed-signal  circuits.  Design styles for
              analog and mixed-signal ICs and their influences on testing the products are
              being  studied.  ACOBs for circuits of practical importance, both discrete and
              continuous time, are being investigated.   A second exploration is into fault
              models for analog circuits which quantitatively link defects to variations in 
              the functional parameters, which are traditionally verified in analog circuit
              test.  These models are being used  to validate the effectiveness of
              defect-oriented testing and design-for-test techniques, including ACOBs.  The 
              algorithms are being verified on practical circuits.  Software for analog and
              mixed-signal test is being  developed.
