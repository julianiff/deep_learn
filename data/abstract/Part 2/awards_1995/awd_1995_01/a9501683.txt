Abstract    :
              Our legal system often requires decision-making.  Judges and legislators must
              often resolve, address, or intelligently incorporate into policy, scientific
              issues that are themselves hotly debated by knowledgeable scientists.  How can
              we best adjudicate competing scientific claims consistently with democratic
              values?  An historian/philosopher of science, Jane Maienschein, a lawyer,
              Daniel Strouse, and a biologist, James Collins, have organized this conference
              in order to formulate a research agenda on questions of how conflicting
              scientific claims are resolved in a constitutional democracy.  Traditionally,
              scholars in science studies, law, and political philosophy have lacked a common
              perspective.  They have different conceptions of evidence and different
              approaches to resolution.  Nonetheless, the issues overlap all these
              disciplines and the scientific. legal, and political communities in which such
              conflict resolution currently proceeds also overlap.  Indeed, legal systems and
              scientific development seem to be central to establishing and stabilizing
              democracies.  Consequently, we need an interdisciplinary study of the
              adjudication of competing scientific claims in the context of such democratic
              systems.  This workshop promises to develop a research agenda for such
              interdisciplinary study by identifying researchable questions, promising
              approaches, and available opportunities.  Experts  from law, biology,
              philosophy, the social and behavioral sciences, and history will gather to be
              held in Phoenix Arizona March 24 and 25 to develop this research agenda.
