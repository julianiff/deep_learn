Abstract    :
              9501859  Gibbs    A   combination  of  photoluminscence,  level  anticrossing, 
              Optically  Detected  Magnetic Resonance  (ODMR),  and  Raman  scattering
              techniques will be used to provide a non-invasive  study   of   semiconductor 
              interfaces  in   technologically  important heterostructures. The studies will
              be conducted on  type II superlattices of gallium-arsenide/aluminium-arsenide 
              as  a  function  of  growth parameters (growth  interruption  times, substrate
              temperature, growth rates, etc.) and growth  techniques  (conventional
              molecular-beam-epitaxy,  migration  enhanced epitaxy, and alternate
              molecular-beam-epitaxy). The  results will elucidate the problem related to the
              electronic  structures       at      gallium-arsenide-aluminium-arsenide 
              interfaces.  Interfaces play an essential and  often  poorly  quantified   role
               in  many  electronic  and  optoelectronic  devices,  this  work, done in
              collaboration with  scientists  from the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute,
              will provide new  experimental information and theoretical interpretation. The 
              results   will  have  significant  impact  on  optical   and  optoelectronic
              technologies.    %%%    Interfaces  play  an essential and often  poorly

              experimental information and theoretical interpretation.  The  project  will
              make use of unique combinations  of  non  invasive  techniques such as
              photoluminescence, level  anti  crossing, optically detected magnetic resonance
              and resonant  Raman  scattering, to study the process of ligh emission  at 
              gallium-arsenide/aluminium-arsenide semiconductor interfaces  as  a  function
              of growth parameters and growth  techniques.  The  results  will have
              significant impact  on  optical  and  optoelectronic technologies.  ****
