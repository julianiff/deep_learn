Abstract    :
              In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, John Fourkas of   Boston
              College will use ultrafast nonlinear optical techniques to probe  
              intermolecular interactions in pure liquids and solutions subjected to  
              confinement in microporous glasses or maintained in a non-equilibrium   state
              of sustained tension.  Transient Grating Optical Kerr Effect   studies will
              probe the reorientational diffusion rates  in these systems,   providing
              information on the local structure of the liquid.  This   structure will be
              sensitive to attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding   and hydrophobic
              forces such as those caused by ionic solutes.  These   forces are involved in a
              wide variety of processes including protein   folding and bubble coalescence. 
              The educational component of this   program involves designing an outreach
              program to provide science   demonstrations at schools and seminars for grade
              school teachers,   designing undergraduate chemistry experiments involving
              contemporary   research problems, and developing courses in communications
              skills in the   graduate curriculum.  The local organization of molecules in
              liquids, water in particular, is   responsible for many solution phase
              properties.  Forces such as hydrogen   bonding have a large impact on the way
              molecules behave when dissolved in   water.  Professor Fourkas will study the
              nature of these forces and the   effects that dissolved molecules have on this
              local order.  These studies   will provide information which can be applied to 
              areas such as   understanding protein folding and the binding of molecules to
              enzymes.
