Abstract    :
              9501530  Spivack    It has been argued that the boron isotopic composition of 
              foraminifera test are a function of both the isotopic  composition of seawater
              and pH.  Initial data indicates that  the B isotopic composition of seawater
              has been nearly  constant over the past 20 Myr while fossil foraminifera  tests
              exhibit a decreasing trend between 7.5 and 20 Ma.  This data has been used to
              infer changes in surface ocean  pH, approximately constant between 7.5 Ma and
              the present  and with an increasing trend form 20 Ma (pH 7.4 4 + 0.2) to  7.5
              Ma.    Investigators on this project will:  1. Conduct a systematic 
              intercomparison of the &11B of common planktonic species  isolated form recent
              sediments, 2. systematically examine  the foraminifera 11B.
