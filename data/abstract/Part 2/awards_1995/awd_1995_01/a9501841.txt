Abstract    :
              9501841  Babuska    The project concentrates on basic problems of computational 
              mathematics   and its  applications in mechanics.  The following major 
              directions will be   addressed: 1)   The problem of a-posteriori error
              estimation and  adaptive   procedures; 2)   Various types of recovery of data
              of interest  from the finite   element solution; 3)   The problem of analysis
              of the  uncertainties in the   input data on the solution, of stochastic or
              maximal character;  and 4)     Computational aspects of the h-p version of the
              finite element  method.   Theoretical, computational, and implementational
              aspects  mentioned above   will be addressed.    Computational analysis has
              become the major tool in science and   engineering, because of the availability
              of powerful computers.   The major   problems are the assessment of the
              reliability of the computed  data and the   design of adaptive approaches when
              the computer selects by itself  the most   effective way to compute reliability
              data of interest.  This  project   concentrates on these essential problems. 
              It will address the  reliability of   the numerical solution of partial
              differential equations and of  the models   described by the equations, as well
              as adaptive approaches  leading to the   best results.
