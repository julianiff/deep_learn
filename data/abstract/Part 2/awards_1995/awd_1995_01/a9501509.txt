Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Program. 
              This study will examine how two low income Mexican-American communities use
              social networks to deal with day to day economic issues.  Theoretical issues
              focus on how social capital that is manifested through social networks
              facilitate or constrain economic participation.  Fieldwork has been completed
              in the first community, made up of Mexican migrants living in San Jose. 
              Funding is requested for establishing residence from which to conduct
              participant observation of a second community, made up of Chicanos in Los
              Angeles.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of
              poverty and urban life, immigrant communities, and the economy and it will
              provide policy makers with information about the ways to promote economic
              resources in poor communities.  In addition to the scientific gains to be
              achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
              student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes
              to the future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of
              the next generation of social scientists.
