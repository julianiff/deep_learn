Abstract    :
              9501740   The focus of this research is on the development of easily
              implementable (Q,r) inventory policies for multi-echelon spare parts
              distribution system, where Q and r stand for order quantity and re-order point
              respectively.  By easily implementable policies, the investigator implies 1)
              policies that do not depend on difficult to estimate or unestimatable
              parameters, 2) policies that lead to closed form expressions for stocking
              parameters that can be computed using a spreadsheet, and 3) small  changes in
              the list of part numbers being managed do not require re-running the entire
              algorithm to adjust the control parameters.  In other words, the system only
              needs to be updated periodically.  The investigator's justification for the
              research are 1) lack of actual use of existing models, 2) the computational
              requirements involved with existing approaches, and 3) the difficulty involved
              in estimating system control parameters with traditional approaches.  The
              objective of the research is to extend the existing models to the point where a
              useful design tool can be developed. The research also addresses strategies to
              integrate students in the study and deploy the results to support student
              teaching and education.   The outcome of this research has the potential to
              advance the state-of-the-art in inventory control systems.  The research can
              lead to improvement in the design process, both in terms of reducing investment
              on inventory and increasing service level.  The use of closed form expressions
              in a dynamic inventory system can pave the way for a higher use rate of the
              models in controlling inventory systems.
