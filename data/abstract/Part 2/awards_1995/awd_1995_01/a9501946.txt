Abstract    :
              CTS-9501946  Edith Sevick  University of Colorado      The career development
              plan involves three areas of research:  polymer brushes as microvalves,
              electrophoretic separations using microlithographic arrays of polyelectrolyte
              chains, and adsorption of surfactants onto a model clay suspension.  The focus
              of the research will be on the design, modeling and construction of a novel
              microvalve system, consisting of polymer chains end-grafted onto pores several
              nanometers in diameter.  The microvalves impart unique flow control to the
              membrane without mechanical parts or feedback control loops.  Understanding how
              the adsorbed polymer brushes sense and respond to flow under different
              geometry's may lead to unique membranes with flow-dependent properties. 
              Potential applications include filtration and controlled drug release.  The
              educational plan involves the development of a graduate course in statistical
              mechanics, and the introduction of computer simulation and process simulators
              to the undergraduate curriculum.
