Abstract    :
              This research is an integrated approach to design of VLSI circuits,  with an
              emphasis on developing tests for thermal and electrical  stress, and power
              management.  The first goal is to use stress  testing as a low-cost alternative
              to burn-in.  Methods to  synthesize tests for electrical and thermal stress
              based on  accurate measure of signal activity are being explored.  In low 
              power design, the following are being pursued: 1. develop Monte  Carlo based
              approaches estimation of signal and glitching activity  in sequential and DSP
              circuits; 2. find architectural and  system-level power minimization
              techniques; 3. investigate current  switching techniques for power management;
              and 4. design layout  algorithms for circuits with low power consumption. 
              Sample  sequential and digital signal processing circuits are being 
              synthesized.
