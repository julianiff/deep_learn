Abstract    :
              9501760  Gadh  This grant provides funding for a Career award for research in
              computer aided design.  Its goal is to provide a framework for creating shape
              designs in a virtual environment and analysis of manufacturability and die
              shape analysis in a virtual prototyping environment.  The principal domain to
              which this approach is applied is near net-shape manufactured parts using
              processes such as injection molding or die casting.  There are three
              significant components to this research.  The first focuses on creation of
              concept geometric designs in a virtual environment, and the second and third
              focus on bringing downstream analysis upstream to the virtual design stage. 
              The approach will be to use a set of non-uniform B-splines to represent the
              surface model of an object, using an energy based approach that utilizes
              springs connecting the control points of the surface, thus ensuring smooth
              modification of the surfaces.  Feature extraction will be defined in terms of
              chains of higher level entities called loops.  Automated die design will be
              performed in two steps.  In the first step,  the orientation of the part with
              respect to the die-open direction will be determined.  In the second step, a
              parting line is extracted using a variation of the differential depth filter
              that extracts the silhouette of the part.  Virtual design allows concepts that
              reside in the designer's mind to be input into a computer with natural human
              gestures.  This procedure should speed design time and make the process of
              design more intuitive.
