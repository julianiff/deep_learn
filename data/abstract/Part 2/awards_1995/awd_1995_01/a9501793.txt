Abstract    :
              9501793  Murphy  This project is on research to enhance the design and 
              fabrication of microsystems for medical and biological  applications.  Two
              demonstration projects are proposed for  this purpose.  The first project is
              the development of a  strain sensor to be mounted directly on bone fixation 
              plates, which could be monitored using an external  ultrasound sampling system.
               This could significantly  improve the orthopedists' control of when bone
              plates are  removed, greatly reducing the risk of a second fracture  adjacent
              to the original break.  The second project is to  develop an arthroscopic
              instrument based on sensing  technology developed for in situ laboratory
              cartilage  research to assist diagnosis of a common orthopedic problem, 
              chondromalacia.  This project will push the limits of  current microfabrication
              technology and help to define the  requirements for interfacing between
              macroscale and  microscale machine elements.  ***
