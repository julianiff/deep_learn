Abstract    :
              9501682  Mehregany  This short course will provide an overview of MEMS
              technology with an emphasis on how to make use of the  MultiUser MEMS Process
              (MUMPS) program at MCNC. This program exists to provide low-cost, easy access
              to MEMS technology for all domestic organizations including academia.  The
              short course will be attended by twenty academics who will incorporate the MEMS
              capabilities discussed within undergraduate and graduate courseware.  ***
