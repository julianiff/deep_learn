Abstract    :
              DMS-9501559  PI: Its    Its will investigate several topics in mathematical
              physics.  These include Riemann-Hilbert approach to the asymptotic analysis of
              the correlation functions of quantum exactly solvable models, the isomonodromy
              method in the theory of Painleve equations and its application to the inverse
              monodromy problems, and Riemann-Hilbert scheme of the asymptotic analysis of
              the matrix models and orthogonal polynomials.    The research involves the
              theory of nonlinear integrable equations, which was first used to integrate the
              Korteweg-de Vries equation via the so called inverse scattering method.  During
              the last twenty years this method has been developed into an important branch
              of mathematical physics and is one of the principal sources of new analytical
              and algebraic ideas of many branches of modern mathematics, including quantum
              group theory and the theory of special functions.
