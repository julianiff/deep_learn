Abstract    :
                 This project will develop a set of tools that will  automatically  map data
              and computation for HPF programs, thereby reducing the  programming time and
              effort required for producing efficient and  portable  parallel programs. The
              system of tools will use the  alignment-distribution  graph as the internal
              representation of  Fortran 90 (and HPF) programs and use  graph-theoretic,
              linear-  algebraic and discrete optimization techniques to  determine 
              alignment and distribution of arrays that minimize program  completion time. 
              The system will not be limited to the `owner-  computes` rule  often employed
              by HPF compilers, but will choose  the computation rules that  minimize running
              time of the program.  The system will also provide a back-end  for generating
              code for  message passing systems, and a graphical user interface  for 
              debugging and visual feedback. The project will develop  algorithms for 
              inter-procedural layout analysis, and heuristics  for reducing the complexity
              of  analysis algorithms.    The educational component of this project will
              develop  undergraduate courses with laboratory emphasizing experiment  design, 
              measurement and use of statistical analysis.
