Abstract    :
              Replication is key to achieving performance and fault tolerance in widely
              distributed systems.  Conservative replica management schemes do not scale
              well, yet optimistic approaches depend in complex  ways on workload,
              architecture, topology, and failure modes of the system. This research captures
              the  design space for optimistically replicated systems in a flexible,
              object-oriented, simulation model,  allowing alternative architectures to be
              evaluated on a `level playing field.` The object-oriented  nature allows
              specialization of model components, permitting experimentation with alternative
              designs,  communications bandwidths, failure distributions, workload models,
              etc. A flexible workload generation  tool which can be tuned to produce
              synthetic traces matching the statistical properties of various  anticipated
              environments is also produced. The simulation and synthetic trace generator are
              validated  by comparison with analytical models and measurements of real
              systems.  This reqearch will enable  designers of a broad range of distributed
              database and filing systems to assess the impact of an  optimistic app roach to
              achieving high performance and availability in large scale systems.  The 
              educational plan seeks to add a `hands-on`, experimental component to the
              operating systems  curriculum. Synchronization, scheduling, and concurrency
              control simulation labs are constructed and  piloted using the same
              object-oriented simulation methodology as in the research plan. This provides a
               balance to the current theoretical approach to teaching operating systems to
              both undergraduate and  graduate students.
