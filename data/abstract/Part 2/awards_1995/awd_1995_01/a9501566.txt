Abstract    :
              9501566  Lobkowicz       Analysis continues on photon and neutral pion 
              production by hadrons.  Data were obtained in exposures to  pion and proton
              beams at Fermilab.  Direct photon yields  will be compared with neutral pion
              yields in pion  interactions with protons and with neutrons.  Further goals 
              are comparison of production by protons at 500 FeV and 800  GeV and their
              dependence on target nuclear species using  data obtained with Beryllium,
              Copper, Silicon as well as  Hydrogen targets.  Two PhD these will be written on
              these  analyses by graduate students at the University of Rochester  supported
              by this grant.  ***
