Abstract    :
              9501470  Clark  This CAREER award emphasizes research and educational 
              activities related to attenuating acoustic response of  enclosed sound fields
              such as the fuselage of an aircraft  subjected to turbulent boundary  layer
              excitations. A  coupled model of the aeroelastic, structural acoustic system 
              is developed for single-leaf and double-leaf partitions  between compressible
              flow fields with a mean velocity and an  enclosed sound field. Turbulent
              boundary layer noise models  are used to generate the exogenous inputs to the
              system, and  acoustic response is controlled through structural acoustic 
              control methods. Wind tunnel tests are performed for model  validation and
              alternate control strategy evaluation.  Educational programs include the
              development of an  electromechanical control system demonstration unit, 
              outreach to a local science museum, design of a course on  adaptive structures,
              and integration of latest computer  software packages for dynamics and control
              in undergraduate  mechanical engineering instructions.***
