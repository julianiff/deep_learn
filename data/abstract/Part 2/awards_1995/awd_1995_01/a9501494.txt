Abstract    :
               This project investigates the topic of approximation  algorithms in
              computational geometry, with focus on  the   two problems: polyhedral surface
              modeling and  Euclidean   shortest paths.  In  surface modeling, one tries to 
              construct a polyhedral model   of a complex  surface, based on a set  of
              unordered sample points.  The   complexity of  constructing and manipulating
              the model   depends on its number of  vertices and faces, and therefore a
              natural optimization goal   is  to minimize  these features in the model
              without exceeding a pre-specified   error tolerance.  The project studies
              various  surface-modeling problems within   the formal  framework of 
              computational geometry, and analyzes the issues   of computational  complexity.
                 The problem of computing shortest paths is   central to robotics  and
              autonomous navigation. The research investigates   approximation algorithms for
              shortest path problems in  two   and three  dimensions.  In two dimensions, the
              query version  of the   shortest path problem  is studied: preprocess a set of 
              polygonal obstacles so that   given two  points p and q, the  distance between
              them can be determined   in polylogarithmic  time.  In three dimensions, the
              goal is to design simpler and   more  practical  alternatives to the exact
              algorithms for shortest paths    among polyhedral solids  or on a polyhedral
              surface.
