Abstract    :
              9501959  Rosenberg       Support is provided to a junior member of the faculty 
              at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research  and teaching under
              the NSF Faculty Early Center (CAREER)  Program.  The P.I. will introduce an
              innovative laboratory  course in which students will be introduced to forefront
               experimental technique and instrumentation to be used in  studying
              superconductivity phenomena in various materials.  His research project is a
              search for evidence that AXIONS  exist.  These hypothesized particles are
              candidates for the  missing, dark, matter in the universe, a subject of intense
               interest.  The experiment, already in the setup stage at the  Lawrence
              Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a  collaborative effort with physicists
              from LLNL, University  of Florida, University of California, and Fermilab. 
              They  expect to achieve a power sensitivity 100 times greater than  that in
              previous experiments with a mass reach extended to  the 1.5 ueV - 12.6 ueV
              range.  ***
