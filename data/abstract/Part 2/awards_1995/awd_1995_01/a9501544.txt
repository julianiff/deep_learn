Abstract    :
                  An empirical model of the three-dimensional Earth's magnetosphere  which
              will provide specification of magnetic and electric  fields  as well as plasma
              parameters will be constructed.  This effort  involves extending the existing
              three-dimensional magnetic field  model of the magnetosphere by (1) providing
              plasma distribution in  force equilibrium with the magnetic forces, (2)
              determining  electric field pattern in the magnetosphere by mapping its pattern
               from the ionospheric level, and (3) implementing realistic  representation of
              global changes during the substorm growth phase.   The resulting model will
              provide a global specification of magnetic  and electric fields together with
              plasma parameters (number  density, convective flow velocity, and temperature)
              without any  constraint on the spatial scale size.  The effort will be extended
               to include a representation of the substorm growth phase.  The  model will be
              useful in providing initial setup parameter values  for numerical (MHD, hybrid,
              or full particle) simulation to  investigate on subsequent dynamical changes.
