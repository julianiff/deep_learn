Abstract    :
              9501809  Bungay  This  project  is  on  research  to  improve  and  quantify  
              the  performance  of  a rotating biological contactor  (RBC)  for  the 
              production  of microbial cellulose using the organism Acetobacter  xylinium.  
              The  objectives  of this research  include:  (1)  the  rational design of a RBC
              process for microbial cellulose; (2)  an  integrated  program  of  modeling and
              experimentation  to  devise  optimum feed rates and concentrations and spent
              medium withdrawal  rates  for  a semi-batch process; and (3) a preliminary 
              economic  analysis  to  compare semi-batch and continuous operations  as  a 
              basis for scale up to commercial operations.  ***
