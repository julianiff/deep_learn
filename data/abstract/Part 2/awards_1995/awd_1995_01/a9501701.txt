Abstract    :
              9501701  Burghelea       This project pursues research on the topology of the
              free loop  spaces, on the homotopy type of the space of symplectomorphisms and 
              on von Neumann topology.  More precisely, one investigates: (1) the  analogy
              between algebraic topology of the free loop spaces and  algebraic geometry; (2)
              applications of string cohomology; (3) new  methods to detect nontrivial
              homotopy groups of the space of  symplectomorphisms; and (4) numerical
              invariants such as the  Novikov-Shubin invariant, L2-torsion, and the L2-eta
              invariant for  compact manifolds with infinite fundamental group.       This
              research will provide new  developments in areas like  algebraic geometry,
              differential geometry, elliptic operators, and  von Neumann algebras.  It will
              broaden the present knowledge in,  and (hopefully) will discover new
              relationships between, such  different areas as algebraic geometry and free
              loop spaces, or  algebraic geometry and symplectotopology.  It will also answer
               specific questions (solve ppoblems) of immediate concern in  topology,
              geometry and mathematical physics.  ***
