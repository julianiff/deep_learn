Abstract    :
              This research is on design techniques for circuits with a power  supply voltage
              of 0.5V.  Innovations in technology, circuits, and  architecture are being
              explored.  Issues being pursued in the  design of low-threshold devices are:
              when to shut down and  efficient shutdown.  Leakage currents are a major power
              drain in  using low-threshold devices.  Thus, techniques to efficiently  detect
              and power down idling hardware are being devised.  The  potential of using
              adaptive supply voltages to exploit time-varying  computational requirements is
              being investigated.  Studies of the  fundamental limits of reducing energy per
              computation are being  developed into a general theory of DSP algorithms which
              can use  dynamic power supply voltages.  Such algorithms change  computational
              complexity dynamically, thus saving power.  Circuits  which operate at supply
              voltages less than 0.5V are being  fabricated.
