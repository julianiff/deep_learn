Abstract    :
              9501517  Ahern       The project involves research on several problems related
              to the automorphism group of n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. For
              automorphisms of finite period the two main problems are the linearization
              problem and the related fixed point problem. Another theme treated in this
              project is the question of describing, in some sense, all one parameter
              subgroups and the related question of determining which automorphisms have
              square roots in the sense of composition.      This project is a synthesis of
              complex geometry, algebra and analysis. The project involves understanding the
              algebraic and fixed point structure of certain transformations on n-dimensional
              complex space. These transformations are called automorphisms which means that
              they preserve the shape of the space. In one direction the research asks
              whether certain of these automorphisms are linear, i.e., preserve linear
              structure. In another direction one tries to determine whether these
              automorphisms behave like linear automorphisms in the sense of having fixed
              points. These automorphisms play an important role in the study of complex
              manifolds.  ***
