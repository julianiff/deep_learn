Abstract    :
              Abstract  OPP-9501808    This program would provide an organized opportunity for
               undergraduates in a relatively isolated geographical area to gain  research
              experience in environmental chemistry and biochemistry.  We have proposed a
              diversified approach centering around  environmental and biotechnical
              applications of chemistry and  biology in which students work with committed
              faculty.  This  research focus, spotlighting chemical and biochemical
              components  of environmental and ecological studies specific to high 
              latitudes, is appropriate for undergraduates.  Core disciplines  in chemistry
              and biochemistry are well represented with projects.  Research projects include
              environmental chemistry, molecular  evolution, bioinorganic chemistry,
              molecular biology of marine  organisms, and atmospheric chemistry.    The
              program will recruit undergraduate students who are majoring  in chemical or
              biological science, and encourages women and  minorities such as native
              Alaskans who are attending the  University of Alaska to apply.  We wish to
              continue our cross-  cultural approach in which Alaskan students exchange
              scientific  and social perspectives with students from the lower 48.  A  summer
              seminar series by both local faculty and visitors is  included in our program
              to increase the exposure of the students  to a wide range of chemistry and
              biochemistry.  Ethics and honor  in science discussions are also held weekly
              and outside speakers  will be invited.  Evening workshops on graduate school
              admission  and selection, as well as discussions of career opportunities  will
              be held.  We also will develop an improved follow-through  and tracking of
              students to monitor what careers the students  pursued.
