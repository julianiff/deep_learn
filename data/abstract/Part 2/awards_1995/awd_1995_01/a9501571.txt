Abstract    :
              Recent improvements in speech recognition technology has made spoken natural
              language dialog a viable  means of human-computer interaction.  An important
              unresolved issue is the handling of  miscommunication.  By studying previously
              recorded human-human and human-computer dialogs, the  following strategies for
              reducing miscommunication in natural language dialog will be investigated: ( 
              1) extending an expectation-driven model for input understanding; (2)
              developing a context-based model  for selective verification of user inputs;
              and (3) developing methods for engaging in subdialogs for  resolving
              miscommunications.  These theories will be implemented and evaluated under both
              simulated  and experimental conditions.  The results from this project will
              provide a new benchmark in evaluating  the adequacy of current dialog theory as
              well as provide further data on the characteristics of spoken  human-machine
              dialog.  The project will also develop several enrichment educational programs
              in  support of the predominantly rural and less economically developed eastern
              part of North Carolina.
