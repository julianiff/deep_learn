Abstract    :
              This research focuses on a comprehensive approach to achieving individual and
              collaborative interactions for extremely complex simulation data. Such datasets
              would overwhelm existing systems. They often share many common attributes in
              their organization, data evolution and dependencies, and patterns of shared,
              coherent access by human or automated agents. These commonalties can be
              captured through a suitable set of abstractions, and exploited to achieve
              fundamental improvements in methods for manipulating, sharing, and
              understanding such broad collections of data. Specifically, the project is
              aimed at constructing a system for interactive visualization of extremely
              complex datasets, by developing techniques for: (1) query factoring, (2)
              predictive fetching, (3) detail degradation, (4) conservative algorithms, (5)
              hybrid cost metrics, and (6) an interactive tool infrastructure. The
              educational component addresses the potential for collaborative interactive
              techniques to improve pedagogy at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional
              levels, and performance evaluation at the undergraduate level.
