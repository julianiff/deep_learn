Abstract    :
              9501508  Miles  In this project, the PI, in collaboration with a graduate
              student,  will study problems in geophysical fluid dynamics, with specific 
              focus on the transfer of energy from turbulent winds to surface  waves.  The
              PI's original theory of 1957 was recently extended to  include the effects of
              wave-induced perturbations of the turbulent   Reynolds stresses.  In this
              project, a specific mechanism will be  examined to counter criticisms of this
              extension.  Another focus  will be to attempt to quantify the effects of wind
              gustiness on  wind-to-wave energy transfer.  ***
