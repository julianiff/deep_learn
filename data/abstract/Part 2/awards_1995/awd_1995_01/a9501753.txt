Abstract    :
                       ABSTRACT  Phelan  U/ Hawaii  CTS-9501753    Research on the contact
              resistance between nonmetallic compounds at cryogenic temperatures will
              performed. This work has applications in mechanical cryocoolers and in
              applications of high-temperature superconductors. The work will focus on
              combinations of metallic-nonmetallic  and nonmetallic-nonmetallic contacts. The
              work will use experimental measurements to aid in developing a model of the
              contact resistance at these conditions with the goal of providing a tool for
              the thermal design of cryogenic equipment.    The education program includes
              development of advanced nontraditional courses in heat transfer as well as a
              new undergraduate course in Energy Conversion Systems. Of special note are
              proposed student exchange programs with a Japanese university and outreach
              programs to native Hawaiian and Filipino students. These programs have special
              value for the investigator+s home institution of the University of Hawaii.
