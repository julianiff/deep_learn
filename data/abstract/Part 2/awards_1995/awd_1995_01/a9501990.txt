Abstract    :
              The primary goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the first laser
              device that operates without population inversion, thereby resolving the
              ongoing discussion regarding the necessity of inversion.  The system considered
              here is based on intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. 
              If successful, the proposed device will present a breakthrough in the search
              for coherent optical devices in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic
              spectrum.  Due to the difficulty of inverting the subband populations, laser
              devices in this region- with important applications in atmospheric sensing and
              pollution monitoring- have so far been elusive.  Therefore, the class of
              inversionless laser amplifiers and oscillators that we propose to demonstrate
              will provide a new perspective on how to make infrared lasers that are
              compatible with the semiconductor technology. The implications of the proposed
              research is therefore twofold:  1) The first experimental demonstration of a
              new principle that alters the way we think about lasers; and 2) A novel
              approach to the realization of  lasers and nonlinear infrared sources with
              wavelengths in the 2 micrometers to 100 micrometers region.
