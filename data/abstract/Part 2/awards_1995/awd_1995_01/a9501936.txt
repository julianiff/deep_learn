              This award supports cooperative research between researchers at  the Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, New York, and  the Chinese Academy of
              Sciences' Institute of Physics on laser-  semiconductor interaction.  Both
              institutes have fully equipped  and operational laboratories specializing in
              ultrafast  optoelectronics. Experiments will be performed to contribute to 
              applications associated with the generation and detection of  ultrahigh power
              electromagnetic radiation.  Up to four students  from RPI will join the
              principal investigator in China to conduct  the experiments.  This research
              effort augments research funded  under NSF award ECS 9211566.
