Abstract    :
              ***  9501730  Ashford       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop electronic diagnostics and novel high-velocity
              electroflocking for advanced materials fabrication.  Low-velocity
              electroflocking is a common textile technology used in the manufacture of pile
              fabrics such as nylon velour.  Electrostatics are used to position large
              numbers of short fibers ("flock") on and partially into surfaces. To be useful
              in the production of engineered fiber composite materials, electroflocking must
              be extended to enable   - high packing fractions   - highly oriented flock that
              is strictly vertical   - bulk processing of fiber and whisker materials made of
              carbon, ceramic or metal       Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of strobe
              video diagnostics and higher velocity electroflocker design. Phase II will
              continue hardware development, velocity diagnostics, process modeling, fiber
              implantation development, and process scale up.  Commercial applications in
              reinforcements, interface conductance and optical properties will be pursued.  
                  Novel oriented, non-woven fiber composite materials having tailored
              thermal, dielectric and mechanical properties will result. Potential
              applications exist for: reinforced materials, non-reflective coatings,
              microchannel heat exchangers, high conductance ceramics, plasma-facing
              materials, radar absorbing materials, and carbon electrodes.  ***
