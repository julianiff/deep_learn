Abstract    :
              9501824  Hess  In this CAREER award, dynamic models of structural  assemblies
              using threaded fasteners are developed. These  models accommodate the
              interaction of friction and vibration  as well as the dynamic constraints and
              nonlinearities  inherent to threaded components. The dynamic models of these 
              structural assemblies, such as aircraft structures and  orthopedic fixations,
              lead to design criteria which minimize  maintenance and structural failure due
              to vibration-induced  fastener loosening. The criteria are tested through 
              extensive experiments with aircraft assemblies and  orthopedic fixation
              assemblies. The educational program  complements and integrates research in the
              areas of  nonlinear vibrations and tribology with industrial  partnerships at
              both the undergraduate and the graduate  levels.***
