Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  This study will examine the conditions under which welfare recipients
              are able to make the transition into the job market.  Theories examined include
              those relating to human capital, network links, and individual attitudes about
              the self.  A carefully selected sample of 50 AFDC recipients will be
              interviewed to learn which characteristics are most likely to lead to
              successful job transitions.  Additional information will be obtained from
              interviews with potential employers.  %%%   This research will contribute to
              sociological understanding of urban poverty, welfare policies, and the pathways
              to employment.  The focus of this research on welfare and the transition to
              work makes it valuable for policy makers concerned with encouraging employment.
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the national and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
