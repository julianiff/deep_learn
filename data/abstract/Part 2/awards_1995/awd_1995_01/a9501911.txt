Abstract    :
                     ABSTRACT  Norris  UVA  CTS-9501911     Aerogels are unusual materials
              composed of nanometer-sized particles and pores.  Silica aerogels have
              extremely low density, and the microstructure gives them unusual thermophysical
              properties that allow important applications such as for electrical and thermal
              insulators. This research centers on determining the thermal properties of
              thin-film aerogels, for which standard experimental techniques and analyses
              cannot be applied. Fractal analysis will be applied to understanding the
              properties of thin-films from their microstructure, and experiments will be
              carried out to determine the thermal conductivity of thin-film aerogels on
              substrates and to demonstrate the existance of length-scale effects at the
              microscale at room temperatures.    The educational plan emphasizes bringing
              statistical methods, including design of experiments, into the engineering
              curriculum. In addition, the PI has plans for expanding an already strong
              mentoring program for encouraging women to enter engineering, both in the
              university and with junior high and high-school students.
