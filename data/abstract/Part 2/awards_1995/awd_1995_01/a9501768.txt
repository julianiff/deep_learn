Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is two-fold.  First, it seeks to study the 
              communication characteristics of applications that can benefit from  the
              computing power, very large memory, and high-speed  communication of parallel
              computing systems.  Within this context  measurements are being takel of the
              traffic generated by both  regular and irregular scientific applications,
              applications written  in a variety of programming paradigms, data-mining
              applications and  applications with real-time traffic demands.  Second the
              project  seeks to use the information gathered from applications to guide  the
              designs for interconnect devices and programmable communication  coprocessors
              that efficiently support multiple classes of  applications and multiple
              programming paradigms.    The education plan addresses two important issues in
              experimental  computer science: First it addresses the issue to teaching a 
              subject area, such as high performance computing, that is  technology-driven
              and where the relevance of knowledge and  information can have a very short
              life span.  Second, it addresses  the issue of teaching the methodology of
              experimentation and in  particular the process of designing experiments.
