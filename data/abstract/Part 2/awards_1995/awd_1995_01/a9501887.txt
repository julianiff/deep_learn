Abstract    :
                  9501887  Everett  The specific aims of this project are to improve our
              understanding  of how and why accidents and injuries occur in construction; to 
              assess the effectiveness of existing tools, technologies, and  construction
              methods in reducing accidents and injuries; to develop  and test new
              technologies to help reduce accidents and injuries;  and to educate a new
              generation of construction engineering and  management students to appreciate
              the hazards of construction craft  work and begin to do something about it.
