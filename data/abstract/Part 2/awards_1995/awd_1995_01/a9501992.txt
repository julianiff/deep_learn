Abstract    :
              Dr. Christopher C.  Cummins, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts   Institute of
              Technology, is supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic,   and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a   Faculty Early Career
              Advancement Award to study radical bond-forming   reactions of inorganic
              compounds and to contribute to several aspects of   the MIT teaching program. A
              major portion of the research is directed   toward the design and synthesis of
              new metal complexes that will undergo   clean radical reactions with a variety
              of inorganic substrates. Examples   include Ti(III)-amido species which will
              react with early   transition-metal oxo-complexes to yield heterometallic
              bridging oxo   compounds and with nitrido complexes to form
              metal-nitrogen-metal units.   The teaching plan  has several goals including
              the design of a new course   in inorganic chemistry which is based on Nobel
              Lectures, the institution   of an informal seminar series, and service as an
              undergraduate academic   advisor.  In many chemical compounds each electron is
              paired with another. In some,   however, this pairing is not complete and
              compounds which contain one or   more unpaired electrons are called `radicals`.
              While radicals are known   to be very reactive, they have not been extensively
              explored as   precursors for inorganic substances. The purpose of this study is
              to   prepare stable metal containing radicals and utilize them to develop new  
              routes to important classes of inorganic compounds. The teaching portion   of
              the project is designed to improve the effectiveness of the chemical  
              education program, mostly in inorganic chemistry, at MIT.
