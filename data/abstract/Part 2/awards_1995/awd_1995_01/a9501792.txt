Abstract    :
                    9501792  Brinson  This CAREER grant is to support research in advanced
              materials  characterization and modeling in two areas: shape memory alloy 
              materials and polymer matrix composites.  The shape memory alloys  of special
              interest are those that are potentially of the "self  healing" type which are
              useful in damage tolerant structures.  The  coupled effects of physical aging,
              temperature and moisture in the  polymeric composites will be studied from both
              the experimental and  theoretical viewpoints.  The educational plan involves
              attempts at  motivating undergraduates and getting graduate students to better 
              understand the process of learning.  ***
