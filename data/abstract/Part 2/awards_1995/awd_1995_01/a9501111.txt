Abstract    :
              9501111  Maroudas  This is a CAREER program with emphasis on both research and
              teaching  in the area concerned with the reliability of metallic thin films
              used in device interconnections in integrated circuits.  The research aspects
              of  the program address the effects of thin-film chemical composition on the
              evolution of the  microstructure and the propagation of damage in the metallic
              conductor under electric thermal and stress fields involved during thin-film
              processing and circuit operation.  The program involves atomic-scale modeling
              to predict surface and interfacial thin-film properties and analysis of
              compositional effects on grain-structure evolution, the dynamics of precipitate
              formation and void propagation.  The educational aspect of the program relies
              on  computational materials science to offer the necessary tools to model the
              experimental observations and to introduce the results of these studies into
              graduate-level courses.  ***
