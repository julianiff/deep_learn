Abstract    :
              9501796  Feng  The project will involve the application of new technologies  to
              the construction and retrofit of civil infrastructure  systems, specifically,
              high-rise buildings and bridges.  These new technologies will be applied to
              reduce the hazards  posed by wind and earthquakes on these structures with the 
              ultimate objective of improving public safety and reducing  both functional and
              financial losses.  Two projects entitled  "Innovative Vibration Control Systems
              for Buildings" and  "Seismic Protective Systems for Bridges" were chosen for 
              study during the award period.  Both will present  significant technical and
              theoretical challenges common to  interdisciplinary civil infrastructure
              research, and both  will involve collaborative efforts with industry,
              government  and allied disciplines.  The result of these studies should  yield
              significant contributions to the field of civil  engineering as well as lasting
              societal benefit.  The  educational portion of this project will address the
              need to  develop innovative and interdisciplinary civil engineering  curricula.
               The main features of the plan are to develop new  curricula and upgrade the
              traditional curricula to reflect  the latest scientific and technological
              advances, design new  educational modules which effectively integrate classroom
               instruction with research experience, introduce both  undergraduate and
              graduate students to interdisciplinary  research and encourage field and
              experimental study.  The  success of these efforts will enrich the educational 
              experience of students at all levels, attract promising  candidates to the
              field of civil engineering and produce  capable and innovative engineers.  ***
