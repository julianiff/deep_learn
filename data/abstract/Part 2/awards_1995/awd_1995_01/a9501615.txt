Abstract    :
              This research is on synthesis techniques for micro-electronics-  based "embedded
              systems".  An embedded system is one designed for  a specific functionality
              under stringent constraints on its timing  performance and cost.  Design
              automation techniques are being  developed for use in a framework where the
              designer can assess  tradeoffs between various embedded system architectures
              and  designs.  The main capabilities of this framework are: (a) timing 
              analysis for both execution delay and rate constraints; (b)  embeddable
              software and runtime system generation under timing  constrains; (c) software
              size-performance tradeoffs; (d) cost-  performance analysis of architectural
              alternatives, such as pre-  fetch and forward hardware.  This work is
              exploreing system  partitioning and transformation techniques to build system 
              implementations that "guarantee" constraint satisfaction while  optimizing
              system development cost.
