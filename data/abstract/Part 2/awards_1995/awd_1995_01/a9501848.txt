Abstract    :
              9501848  Sober       Research will be carried out in photo-production of mesons 
              using the CLAS detector at the CEBAF electron accelerator, and in  low energy
              electron scattering at the Darmstadt linear  accelerator in Germany.  The
              former data, to be obtained using  circularly polarized photons and with
              polarized targets, will be  used to test the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule
              which relates to  the spin structure of the nucleon.  This is one of the high 
              priority subjects within contemporary nuclear physics.  In  connection with
              this work, development of the CEBAF photon tagger  will be carried out. 
              Additional studies of strangeness  photoproduction will be carried out in
              conjunction with other  members of the CEBAF CLAS collaboration.  The low
              energy electron  scattering will be carried out at the newly-established, low- 
              energy, 180 degree electron scattering facility.  That work will  focus on
              determining magnetic transition strength in light- and  medium-weight nuclei. 
              These data will be used to test nuclear  structure calculations.  Development,
              construction, and  utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment is integral
              to  this activity.  Education of graduate students is  a strong  component in
              every aspect of this grant.  ***
