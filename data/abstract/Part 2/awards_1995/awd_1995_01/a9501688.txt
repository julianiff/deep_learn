Abstract    :
              9501688  LIVINGSTON    This project continues support for the Planning and
              Coordination  Office of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Program (U.S. JGOFS). 
               As a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional scientific enterprise,  U.S. JGOFS
              seeks to identify and quantify the physical, chemical  and biological processes
              controlling biogeochemical cycling in the  ocean, and their interaction with
              the global atmosphere. The goal  is to understand the processes governing the
              production and fate of  biogenic materials in the sea well enough to predict
              their  influences on, and responses to, global scale perturbations. In  order
              to achieve these complex goals, the Planning and Coordination  Office serves
              the needs of coordination, implementation,  communication, publication,
              planning and representation of the  scientific issues involved, both nationally
              and internationally. A  major process study in the Equatorial Pacific has been
              concluded  and is  now in its latter stage of synthesis. Another process study 
              in the Arabian Sea is currently underway.  Measurements of carbon  dioxide,
              plankton, and bio-optical properties are also continuing  at the Bermuda and
              Hawaii Time-Series stations. In addition to  providing managerial support for
              those activities, the Planning and  Coordination Office also coordinates the
              scientific planning  activities of future U.S. JGOFS initiatives.
