Abstract    :
              This research is part of a long term effort to migrate techniques  for
              synchronous design to asynchronous design.  The two focus areas  are sequential
              optimization and synthesis for testability.  In the  former, problem
              formulations of input, output and input/output  encoding are being
              investigated.  In each case, the problems of  optimality, race-free encoding,
              and hazard free logic are being  solved simultaneously.  In the latter,
              synthesis of fully testable  asynchronous state machines using partial or no
              scan is being  pursued.  Design tools, incorporating the algorithms for 
              optimization and synthesis for test, are being developed.
