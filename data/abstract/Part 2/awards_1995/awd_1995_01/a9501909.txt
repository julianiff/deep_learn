Abstract    :
              9501909  Fernandez  This project is on research to exploit the detailed
              residue-level  structural information available from nuclear magnetic resonance
               (NMR) to examine proteins in non-native environments relevant to 
              manufacturing.  Proteins will be examined in a  variety of  environments with
              the goal of developing a general understanding  of protein denaturation during
              precipitation.  Changes in  conformation that occur in the solution state
              before  aggregation/precipitation, conformation changes that occur upon  phase
              change, and the rates of these changes will be examined  with NMR.  In addition
              to this research activity, the  investigator will enhance education by engaging
              in activities on  curricular development, laboratory development and mentoring.
