Abstract    :
              This project explores the development and use of constraint programming
              languages in database applications. Constraint Query Languages (or CQLs) are
              applicable to many domain-specific areas, such as spatial databases, because
              their basic data type generalizes the relational tuple data type and is closer
              to the application semantics, e.g., for spatial databases these generalized
              tuples are  convex spatial point sets . Most importantly, CQLs are designed so
              that I/O-efficient access to large sets of generalized tuples can be supported
              through existing multi-dimensional searching data structures. This project is
              an investigation of both the principles and the practice of CQLs. The
              principles include: the expressive power of various classesof constraints both
              linear and nonlinear; the design of calculus/algebra languages combining 
              constraints and objects; the optimization of constraint programs; and the data
              structures for indexing  very large sets of constraints. The practice involves
              developing prototypes of persistent constraint  languages and evaluating them
              in three concrete application areas: solid  modeling in design  databases; map
              overlays in spatial databases; and subsequence matching in scientific
              databases.  Constraint Query Languages will be key components of the next
              generation of declarative database  interfaces, because they capture
              domain-specific semantics in an efficient fashion, and their  successful
              implementation will be a significant extension of the current relational and
              object-  oriented database technologies
