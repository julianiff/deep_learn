Abstract    :
              This RUI proposal addresses theoretical investigations in  ionospheric radio
              wave propagation.  Specifically, the PI focuses  on the analytical and
              computational studies of the wave processes  occurring in the upper hybrid
              resonance (UHR) region of the  ionosphere during artificial modification by
              high power radio  waves.  Topics to be studied are:  (1) propagation
              characteristics  of ordinary and extraordinary mode electromagnetic waves
              launched  into the ionosphere from ground based transmitters in the presence 
              of electron density irregularities; (2) linear conversion of the  incident wave
              into upper hybrid and cyclotron harmonic waves at the  UHR and their connection
              to the observation stimulated  electromagnetic emissions; and (3) nonlinear
              wave processes caused  by large amplitude waves.  Through guided research
              activities,  undergraduate students will acquire skills in critical thinking, 
              model building, computations and graphing.***
