Abstract    :
              9509270  D'Arcy   The Bignoniaceae family of flowering plants are mostly
              tropical vines, shrubs, and trees, known to temperate-zone botanists from such
              species as trumpet-creeper and several ornamentals.  There are an estimated 900
              species, nearly 800 of which occur in the American tropics.  The foremost
              student of the Bignoniaceae was the widely traveled botanist Dr. Al Gentry, who
              died in an airplane accident two years ago while on botanical reconnaissance in
              South America.  He left at his home institution, the Missouri Botanical Garden,
              a wealth of unpublished information on these plants as well as the major
              collection of herbarium specimens documenting the geographical distributions of
              all the known species.  His colleague Dr. William D'Arcy is now leading a small
              group of specialists, soon to be joined by a postdoctoral associate
              specializing on these plants, to finish the taxonomic revisionary work that was
              underway during Gentry's lifetime.   Work to be done includes computer
              databasing of the several thousands of species identifications completed by Dr.
              Gentry, for specimens from the American tropics, which in turn provides the
              foundation for all regional plant inventories.  Identification keys,
              illustrations of detailed botanical parts, descriptions for new species, and
              comprehensive taxonomic treatments for several neotropical genera are also
              scheduled, as core activities for a newly trained specialist on the
              Bignoniaceae.
