Abstract    :
              Imhoff   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning
              and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.
              The specific goals of this project are to introduce students in grades K-12 to
              the concept of soils as a basic building block of terrestrial ecosystems and
              the concept of ecosystem services that support human life. The teaching and
              learning environment will be integrated with actual baseline data gathering
              efforts being carried out for global change modeling projects supported by NASA
              as part of Mission to Planet Earth. The use of satellite and aircraft based
              remote sensing technology will be a significant part of the program. A primary
              task of the proposed effort will be the creation of a new set of education
              packages through integration of satellite remote sensing and geographic
              information system technology with already existing K-12 soil science education
              models. The new packages will take on the viewpoint  of soils being part of an
              inter-dependent network of Earth system functions and an important provider of
              ecosystem services.
