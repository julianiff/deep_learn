Abstract    :
              9509135  Marchal   This SBIR Phase II project aims to design and implement a
              prototype of interactive multimedia software to support Ordinary  Differential
              Equation (ODE) courses and evaluate its impact in an ODE laboratory course
              setting.  The proposed  software combines mathematical simulation, graphic
              animation, digital video, and hypermdeia to create an  engaging learning
              environment that builds upon contemporary learning theories of contextual
              learning and  constructivism. The Principal Investigators work with the
              NSF-funded Consortium for ODE Experiments to (a)  identify all required
              mathematical content elements required to support an introductory ODE course,
              (b) identify  specific topics to support a laboratory-based ODE curriculum, (c)
              develop software module specifications, (d)  identify and develop
              application-specific software needed to support the modules, (e) implement the
              software  modules, (f) evaluate the prototype in a classroom setting, and (g)
              provide recommendations for the development  of a commercial product.   The
              anticipated benefit of the software is that it provides a convenient and
              challenging way for  students to study  and explore differential equations,
              giving them a bridge between the physical world and  mathematics.
