Abstract    :
              9509097  Csernansky  Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important enzyme involved in 
              proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in many cells.   Preliminary
              experiments were performed examining the subcellular   localization of PKC
              isozymes in mouse pure neuronal cultures  deprived of serum, a model of
              apoptosis.  One isozyme, PKC-delta,  is selectively translocated to the nucleus
              during serum deprivation  injury in neurons.  The hypothesis that translocation
              of PKC-delta  is an early, and possibly critical event in the development of 
              serum deprivation injury will be tested.  Immunoblots will be  performed on
              total and nuclear protein fractions from pure neurons  to confirm that
              translocation of PKC-delta protein is observed when  PKC-delta immunoreactivity
              appears in the nucleus.  PKC kinase  activity will be evaluated for the total
              and nuclear neuronal  protein fractions to determine whether there is a change
              in nuclear  PKC activity during serum deprivation.  Nerve growth factor 
              deprivation-induced apoptosis in PC 12 cells will be used to  determine whether
              translocation of PKC-delta is critical for the   development of apoptosis in
              other model systems.
