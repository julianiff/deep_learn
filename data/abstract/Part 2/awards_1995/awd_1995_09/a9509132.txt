              Hanna This project uses biophysical techniques to analyze the molecular
              mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression at the level of
              transcription, which is catalyzed by RNA polymerase.  The work is focused
              primarily on E. coli, which is an ideal model system in which mechanistic
              studies can be carried out using purified components.  Several novel
              ribonucleotide analogs which are tagged with photocrosslinking, fluorescent, or
              other tags have been developed in this laboratory.  These will be used for
              analysis of protein-nucleic acid interactions in the E. coli transcription
              complex, using electron microscopy and fluorescence polarization techniques %%%
              Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are important in many cellular
              functions, including the regulation of gene expression.  This project uses
              biophysical techniques to study how the enzyme RNA polymerase, which is a
              protein, attaches to the  DNA of a bacterium and transcribes the information in
              the DNA into RNA, which then becomes the blueprint for protein synthesis. ***
