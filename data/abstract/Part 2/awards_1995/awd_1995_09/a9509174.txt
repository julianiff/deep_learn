Abstract    :
              9509174  REGIER  This project will continue the efforts of the investigators to
              sequence protein encoding nuclear genes that will be informative about higher
              level relationships primarily among members of the superfamily Bombycoidea
              (Insecta: Lepidoptera), the silkmoths and their relatives.  For their own
              purposes they are utilizing the sequence information to elucidate subfamily
              relationships in the large family Sphingidae (hawk moths and hornworms, such as
              the tobacco hornworm) and to resolve generic relationships within two tribes of
              Saturniinae (the giant silkmoths, such as the luna moth, cercropia moth, etc.),
              the Attacini and the Saturniini.  In the process they are cloning Lepidoptera
              sequence for new genes that should be of utility to a broad community of
              researchers concerned with molecular phylogenetic analysis.  %%%  The insect
              order Lepidoptera, includes the butterflies, skippers, and moths.  While adults
              of these insects include many aesthetically pleasing members sought after by
              collectors, the larvae or immature forms are much less desirable creatures. 
              Many serious pests of crops, timber, stored products and even our clothing are
              Lepidoptera larvae.  This project will provide information on relationships of
              major groups of Lepidoptera.  Such information can be of value in testing
              hypotheses about changes in host plant use or associations, in efforts to
              explain how pests originate.  It will enhance other research areas by allowing
              hypothesis testing about origins of model and mimic systems, host plant
              specificity, etc..  ***
