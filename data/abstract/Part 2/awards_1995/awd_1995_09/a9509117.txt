Abstract    :
              9509117  Bronzino  The primary hypothesis to be investigated is that, during 
              normal development, the maturation of peak hippocampal theta  frequency is
              related primarily to changes in the modulation  of dentate granule cell
              activity, and not due to alterations  in cellular excitability of CA1 pyramidal
              cells.  Another  hypothesis to be tested is that the biocoherence index is an 
              effective measure of the changing interrelationships that  occur between CA1
              and the dentate gyrus during development  of hippocampal activity.  In previous
              research surgical and  recording techniques were developed that allow a 
              quantitative examination of the development of  inhibitory/facilitatory
              modulation of the dentate granule  cell population.  Modeling techniques will
              be used to  characterize the development of the rat hippocampal EEG  during the
              early postnatal (15-22 days) period of  development.    The studies are
              expected to provide new knowledge on the  interactions that occur between
              hippocampal neural systems  responsible for the generation of hippocampal EEG
              patters as  the animal iteracts with its environment during the early 
              postnatal period of development.  The results will provide  new approaches to
              probe questions related to the maturation  of neural circuits and developmental
              patterns of the EEG in  behaving animals.    The project provides a high
              quality research experience to  undergraduate students through their active
              participation in  surgery and recording techniques and to the development of 
              quantitative and computational techniques applied to  problems in biology.  ***
