Abstract    :
              Abstract K. Supernant    The proposed research is an investigation of how the
              dynein motor complex functions in embryonic and somatic cells.  The
              investigator will isolated and characterize extragenic enhancers and
              suppressors of the dominant "glued" gene and will purify
              mRNP-dynein-microtubule complexes from Drosophila embryos.  Genetic knockout
              experiments will be conducted to test the role of cytoplasmic dynein.  This
              work will be performed in association with Dr. Thomas Hays at the University of
              Minnesota.  %%%  Molecular motors serve to move components within cells much
              like a outboard motor on a boat moves the boat through the water.  The
              applicant will employ genetic approaches possible in the fruit fly Drosophila
              to understand how the motor works.  ***
