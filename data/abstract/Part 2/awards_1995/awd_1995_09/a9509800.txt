Abstract    :
              9509800  Cheung  The research addresses Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation for
              (1) buried dielectric (oxide) formation (SIMOX), (2) ion-beam mixing with
              simultaneous deposition and implantation to form GeSi and GeSiC systems and (3)
              plasma modeling with 2D effects of plasma lateral nonuniformity and ion-beaming
              mixing.  This research emphasizes subsurface material synthesis where the
              implantation is not constrained by thermal equilibrium and implanted
              concentrations greater than solid-solubility can be performed.  In addition to
              buried dielectrics there are variations on the technique to realize buried
              oxynitride (SMON) and buried semiconductor heterojunctions (Si/SiC/Si).  The
              intent in the plasma modeling area is to relate plasma parameters to electronic
              device characteristics.  ***
