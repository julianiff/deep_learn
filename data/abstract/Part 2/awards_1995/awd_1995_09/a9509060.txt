Abstract    :
              9509060  Ramanujan  In this SBIR Phase II project, Architecture Technology
              Corp.,  under the direction of the PI will develop a Distributed Shared  Memory
              multi-computer system using a network of workstations.  During Phase I,
              analytical models were developed to establish the  potential of Network Shared
              Memory (NSM) clusters for achieving  significant cost/performance advantages
              over other approaches. In  Phase II, the analytical results will be validated
              by  implementing an actual NSM and measuring performance for various  parallel
              applications. The prototype NSM will be based on  commodity components.  ***
