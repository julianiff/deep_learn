Abstract    :
              9509562  Liu  The proposed project involves the development of an engineering 
              system of Artificial Upwelling and MIXing (AUMIX) which can draw  nutrient-rich
              deep ocean water (DOW) to the ocean surface as a  precursor to
              commercially-viable, open-ocean mariculture.  This  project will be
              accomplished in two phases.  The first phase,  presently being conducted with
              NSF support, involves the  development of a wave-driven artificial upwelling
              device which  brings nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface in a cost 
              effective manner.  Physical and mathematical models of the device  have been
              developed and tested.  Results of the Phase I research  indicated that a single
              device with a buoy of 4.0 m in diameter  with a tail pipe of 300 m in length
              and 1.2 m in diameter, can  generate an upwelling flow of 0.95 m3/sec in random
              Hawaiian  waves.    The second phase, as now proposed, will investigate the
              discharge  of the artificially upwelled DOW and its subsequent mixing in  open
              ocean.  The objective is to establish a nutrient-rich plume  that can support
              an open ocean mariculture.  To achieve this  objective, the mixing must be
              controlled such that the dilution  is small and the settling depth does not go
              below the euphotic  zone.  ***
