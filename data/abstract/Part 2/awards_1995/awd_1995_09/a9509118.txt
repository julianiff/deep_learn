Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT - Routman - DEB-9509118    One of the most important goals of
              population genetics is to be able to understand the underlying causes of the
              distribution of genetic variation within and among populations.  Scientists
              usually attempt to understand these causal phenomena by measuring the number of
              different forms of a gene and their frequencies in each population.
              Unfortunately, many of the causal mechanisms result in similar geographic
              patterns, and cannot be distinguished when the data consist only of
              frequencies.  Dr. Routman will attempt to test a new method that incorporates
              the genealogical relationships of the genetic variants to differentiate among
              possible underlying causes.    Genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA will be
              measured in populations of Ambystoma tigrinum from the midwestern USA. 
              Genealogies of these variants will be reconstructed, and used in the new method
              that relates the underlying causes listed above to the geographical
              distributions of nested sets of related variants.  The addition of the
              genealogical information results in different predictions from the underlying
              causes.  Because some of these causes are actually known in this species, Dr.
              Routman can test to see if the predictions of the new method are correct. 
              Computer simulations will also be used to test the predictions.  If the method
              withstands rigorous testing, it will be extremely useful for wildlife managers
              and taxonomists working with a wide variety of organisms.
