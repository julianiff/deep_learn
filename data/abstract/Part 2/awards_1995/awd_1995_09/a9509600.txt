Abstract    :
              MCB 9509600  Linda Hansen    The purpose of this research project is to
              characterize cell cycle progression in hepatocytes cultured on the
              extracellular protein fibronectin on the cell attachment sequence, arg-gly-asp,
              found within fibronectin.  At different points in the cell cycle cells,
              particularly hepatocytes, will alter their preference as to the binding site
              within the extracellular matrix.  By identifying which receptors are involved
              in adhesion, and the point at which cell cycle progression diverges on these
              substrates it will be possible to design future studies into defining the exact
              signaling mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix mediated growth control. 
              %%%  The project will investigate the mechanism by which cells adhere to a
              substrate and how the substrate regulates the rate at which cells divide.  ***
