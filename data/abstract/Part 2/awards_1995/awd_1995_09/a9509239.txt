Abstract    :
              9509239  SCHMITT  We propose to experimentally determine how plant morphology
              changes in response to variation in light availability in the model plant
              system, Arabidopsis thaliana.  Light availability will be varied by
              manipulating plant density of genetically homogenous lines of Arabidopsis.  We
              will determine whether morphological changes in response to low light increase
              the probability of a plant surviving and producing offspring under such
              conditions.  We will also investigate the response of several mutants of A.
              thaliana to different light conditions to determine which genes are responsible
              for this morphological change.   This research will provide a better
              understanding of the effect of stress on plant evolution, and it has
              implications for breeding crops that perform well in crowded conditions.
