Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9509240    This effort examines the use of catalytic cracking to
              convert plastic wastes into useful hydrocarbon mixtures.  Polymer-cracking
              properties of amorphous silica-alumina and of various crystalline zeolites are
              compared to ascertain the effects of zeolite channel dimensions on product
              distributions; cracking properties of aluminosilicates are compared with those
              of a sulfated zirconia superacid catalyst to ascertain the effects of catalyst
              acidity; product distribution changes from cracking in oxygen or hydrogen
              atmospheres with catalysts containing platinum are also studied.  Volatile
              cracking products are identified from gas chromotagraphy with a microfurnace
              injector and detection by both mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy.  A
              fixed-bed catalytic reactor is used   to study catalyst coking processes and
              the effects of cracking atmosphere and temperature on product distributions. 
              Overall activation energies for polymer cracking are obtained from
              thermogravimetric (TGA) methods; product-specific activation energies are
              obtained from TGA-MS using linear programmed thermal degradation mass
              spectrometry.  Polymers studied include polyethylene, polypropylene,
              polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride.    Most plastics in use today are made of
              nonbiodegradable polymers; this makes them undesirable in solid-waste
              landfills.  Although "recycling" programs exist in some communities, there is,
              in fact, no economically acceptable technology to recycle most polymers in a
              meaningful way.  This project lays the fundamental groundwork for such a
              technology.    ***
