Abstract    :
              9509343  Garland  This research will develop and test phylogenetically-based
              statistical methods which attempt to account for the independence of datasets,
              especially the evolution of continuously variable characters. Two analytical
              methods will be emphasized: phylogenetically independent contrasts, the most
              widely used and best understood of currently available methods, and
              phylogenetic randomization, a new method that will be developed and which has
              the potential to nullify a number of criticisms previously leveled at
              phylogenetically-based statistical approaches.   %%%  PC-based computer
              programs that allow non-specialists to perform phylogenetic comparative
              analyses will be produced; these programs can also be used in teaching at the
              undergraduate or graduate level. These programs and accompanying documentation
              are distributed free of charge.   ***
