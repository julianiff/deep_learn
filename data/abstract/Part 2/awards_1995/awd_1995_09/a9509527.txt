Abstract    :
              Traditional databases capture only the most current data (snapshot) of the
              modeled reality. While snapshot information is enough for a number of
              applications, it is not sufficient for applications that require past and/or
              future data. Instead, a bitemporal database is needed, i.e., a database that
              supports both valid time (the time when an event was valid in the modeled
              reality) and transaction time (the time when the database was updated). While
              much research has been performed recently on access methods that support
              transaction time, not much has been done for bitemporal indexes, i.e., methods
              that support both transaction and valid time on the same index structure. The
              objective of this project is to design efficient access methods for bitemporal
              databases. A novel approach is used that reduces bitemporal queries to problems
              of partial persistence for which efficient access methods are then designed.
              Various basic bitemporal queries are addressed, like the bitemporal pure and
              range timeslice queries. Concurrency and recovery issues for the new access
              methods are examined. In addition, the migrati on of bitemporal data to a
              three-level storage architecture is examined. The results of this project will
              enhance the efficient  implementation of temporal database management .
