Abstract    :
              9509265  Fabrikant       Collisional and photo-processes involving the formation
              and  destruction of stable and temporary negative ions are studied  using a
              variety of theoretical techniques.  The problems  undertaken include negative
              ion formation in atoms, the  interaction of Rydberg atoms with other atoms and
              polar molecules  and the interaction of electrons with molecules absorbed on 
              surfaces.  ***
