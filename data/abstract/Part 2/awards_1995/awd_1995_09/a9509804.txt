Abstract    :
              9509804  Olmstead   Since the time of Darwin, systematists have worked to
              produce classifications of organisms that represent the evolutionary or
              genealogical relationships among them.  The fact that pre-Darwinian
              classifications of plants have persisted to this day for many groups attests to
              the conservative nature of change in the reproductive structures that were used
              as primary characters by Linnaeus and subsequent botanists.  Research on DNA
              nucleotide sequence variation in flowering plants by Dr. Richard Olmstead and
              several others has revealed serious discrepancies between traditional
              family-level classification and DNA-based groupings, for several well known
              groups of plants including the mint, verbena, borage, and snapdragon families. 
              Similarities in ovary and fruit morphology have apparently misled taxonomists
              to unite genealogically separate groups within the same family.   Dr. Olmstead
              is continuing DNA sequencing studies of genes of the chloroplast in
              representative samples of Boraginaceae, Hydrophyllaceae, and Scrophulariaceae,
              large families with widespread distributions in temperate regions of the world.
               Related groups such as Convolvulaceae (morning glory family), Labiatae
              (mints), and Verbenaceae are being studied by colleagues and others.  The
              DNA-based analyses of relationships will provide a phylogenetic framework for
              this large group of advanced dicots, independent of the schemes based on
              traditional morphological features and thus serving as a test of them.  Because
              such taxa as Antirrhinum, the cultivated snapdragon, serve as model laboratory
              organisms, it is important to know their close evolutionary relatives in order
              to extrapolate genetic and physiological findings.
