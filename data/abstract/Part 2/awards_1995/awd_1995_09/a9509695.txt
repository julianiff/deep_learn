Abstract    :
              Khalil          In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
              Learning and  Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this
              project is designed to meet  the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking
              scientists and schoolchildren in a global  information network with the
              ultimate goal of better understanding the Earth's environment  and   changes
              that take place within it. The specific goals of this project are to fulfill an
               important part of GLOBE's objectives dealing with the atmosphere and climate.
              Three tasks  are to be accomplished: 1) To teach K-12 students about
              atmospheric composition, global  change and climate by providing hands on
              experience, real data and computer based  learning tools. 2) To obtain new data
              on key trace gases involved in climate change and  ozone depletion, at
              continental sites, where such measurements are needed and have not been  taken.
              The atmospheric measurements are supplemented by direct flux measurements to
              study  sources and sinks. And 3) to establish a methodology that is inexpensive
              and ef  ficient so that in the next phase of GLOBE, after this project ends,
              atmospheric      composition can become a core measurement.
