Abstract    :
              9509533  Wiegmann  Theoretical research will be conducted on nonperturbative 
              problems in quantum field theory and condensed matter  physics.  In particular,
              electronic systems with strong  interactions and topological fluids will be
              studied.  Topics  to be studied include Fermi and Bose systems with vector 
              gauge interactions which describe the Mott insulator, liquid  state of flux
              lines in superconductors, fractional quantum  Hall effect, and topological
              liquids.  The research will  focus on topological effects of the gauge field,
              the  character of the ground state of the gauged system,  toplogical
              instability, and fractionalization of the  spectrum as a result of a quantum
              phase transition.  %%%  A variety of physical systems will be investigated
              which are  of current interest.  All of these systems are characterized  by the
              fact that they are strongly interacting and cannot be  treated using existing
              theoretical techniques.  The  theoretical approach will be a mathematical one
              using field  theoretical techniques.  The results of this work will  contribute
              to both condensed matter physics and its  mathematical foundations.  ***
