Abstract    :
                                            1  9509758  Liu  The  overall  goal of this
              investigation is  to  develop  an  implantable  visual prosthesis comprised of
              a silicon  Laser  Powered   Bipolar  Point  Contact  Artificial  Retina   Chip 
              (BPCARC). The project would seek to resolve two problems: 1)  provide  power to
              a chip isolated within the ocular  cavity,  and  2)  on  opposite  sides  of 
              the  chip,  fabricate  the  photoreceptors and the electrodes to stimulate the
              retina. A  laser  would  provide  power to bias a  chip  equipped  with 
              photoconducting  pixels,  as the cornea  is  transparent  to  laser  light  of 
              any visible wavelength.  The  photovoltaic  cells  would  convert  the laser
              radiation  into  electrical  current.  Using  the BPCARC technology, the  chip 
              would  be  polished  to  a thickness to allow light from  the  opposite  side 
              from  where the electrodes are fabricated to  activate  the  photoconducting
              pixels. Thus the fabrication to  create  the    PC   photovoltaic   cells,  
              the   photosensing    or  phototransistor array, and the stimulating array,
              could  all  be performed on a single side of the chip, simultaneously.   
              Successful  results would provide the fundamental  knowledge  needed  to  make
              an artificial, implanted, retina to  enable  the  more  than  10  million
              persons afflicted  by   retinal  diseases   such  as  retinal  pigmentosa,  
              and  age-related  macular   degeneration,  to  regain  the  sense  of   sight. 
              Demonstration of the performance of the chip using frog  and  rabbit  eyes
              would be performed by the Vitro Retinal Service  of the Wilmer Eye Institute,
              Johns Hopkins University.  ***
