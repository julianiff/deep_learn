              ABSTRACT  ATM-9509864  Ghil, Michael  University of California, Los Angeles 
              Title: Travel Support for the "International Symposium on  Assimilation of
              Observations in Meteorology and Oceanography    In July 1990, the first WMO
              international symposium on data  assimilation was held in Lermon-Ferrad,
              France.  A second follow up  symposium on this important and growing subject,
              "WMO international  symposium on assimilation of observations in meteorology
              and  oceanography" os going to be held in Toyko, Japan, during 13-17,  March
              1995.  This is aimed at taking stock of the status,  consolidation of the
              progress achieved and to open new avenues for  data assimilation in
              geosciences.    This proposal seeks travel support for about 18-24 graduate 
              students and post-docs from the USA and developing countries to  participate in
              this symposium.
