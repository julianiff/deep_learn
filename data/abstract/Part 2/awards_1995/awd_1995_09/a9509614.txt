Abstract    :
              The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) a National Systematics Research Resource
              Center, is the country s largest repository of plant and fungal specimens.  It
              is a vast, actively managed, and  intensively use collection of more than
              5,600,000 specimens representing all plant and fungal groups  and is worldwide
              in scope.  Because of the size and richness of the collection, the NYBG
              Herbarium  serves as a primary source of research materials for botanical
              studies throughout the world.  Virtually all major taxonomic revisions of
              plants of the Americas and parts of the Old World include  examination of
              specimens deposited in the NYBG Herbarium.  The New York Botanical Garden
              Herbarium regularly sends more specimens on loan than any other herbarium in
              the world.  In the past five years, loans of 232,927 specimens were sent to 361
              herbaria in 46 foreign countries and 48 states of the USA.  An average of
              46,585 specimens (677 loans) were sent each year.  In these same five years, in
              the 27 journals surveyed, 1098 articles cite use of NYBG specimens.  During
              this same period, 1158 visiting resea rchers from 66 foreign countries and 39
              states of the USA spent 10,644 person-days using the collection.  This project
              will enable the New York Botanical Garden Herbarium to continue its high  level
              of service to the community of botanical researchers and other users of plant
              information.
