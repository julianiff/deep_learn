Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Athanassios Z. Panagiotopoulos  Cornell University  CTS-9509158    The
              main objective of this project is to develop intermolecular potential models
              suitable for predictions of phase equilibrium for industrially important fluid
              mixtures by simulation.  The target accuracy of representation is comparable to
              experimental measurements of moderate precision.  The models developed need to
              be reliable over a wide range of physical environments, temperatures, pressures
              and compositions.  Especially important is the ability to do well for both
              liquid-phase and gas-phase properties.  Transferability of molecular group
              potential parameters from component to component is also highly desirable.  In
              order to achieve the primary objective, methods for extracting model parameters
              from experimental data by adaptive simulations in which the potential is
              changed during sampling of configuration space will be developed.  Initial
              systems of interest include one, two and three-component systems with
              short-chain hydrocarbons and monofunctional organic alcohol's and ketones,
              water and carbon dioxide.
