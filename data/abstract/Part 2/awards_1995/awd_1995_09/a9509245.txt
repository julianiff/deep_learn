Abstract    :
              9509245  Dann      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jesse C. Dann to
              work with Professor Maarten de  Wit at the University of Cape Town in South
              Africa.  The  U.S.-South Africa Program is providing a portion of the  support
              for this project.    This research project will involve the continuation of a 
              detailed mapping project of some of the oldest (3.5 billion  years old) and
              best preserved rocks on Earth, which are  located in the Barberton Greenstone
              Belt of South Africa.  The results will increase our understanding of the
              nature of  Archean crustal behavior, providing an important link in 
              reconstructing the tectonic history of the Earth.  The first  year of this
              project, funded by the South African Foundation  for Research and Development
              (FRD), allowed the initial  mapping and collection of samples for petrographic
              and  geochemical analysis.  During this second year, mapping will  be
              completed, analysis conducted and results worked into  publishable form. ***
