Abstract    :
              Pang   9509304    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is centered on
              enabling low-cost multimedia communications on the desktop computers in a
              typical corporate/campus network environment.  The motivation  behind this
              effort is the rapidly decreasing costs of desktop computers and peripherals,
              and the large installed base of data  network infrastructure.  A mandate on
              this research is  interoperability with the international ITU-T H.320 suite of
              teleconference standards.  Interoperability with the H.320 standards would
              ensure that the system being developed be able to  communicate with existing
              room teleconference systems and future  H.320 compliant products.   The major
              benefits of this research are: (i) use of low-cost  desktops and existing
              network infrastructure, (ii) enhanced functionalities, (iii) significant cost
              reduction over existing desktop teleconference solutions.
