Abstract    :
              MCB 9509028  Gail Matters    The project will initiate a study of blue-light
              regulation of plant gene expression and begin to identify blue-light signal
              transduction intermediates.  The experimental system is based on the gene
              encoding glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, an enzyme which acts early
              in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway.  The project will identify promoter
              regions involved in blue light regulated gene expression and may lead to
              further studies on a factor(s) which interacts with these DNA sequences.  In
              addition, the project will examine potential blue light signaling compounds
              including cAMP, cGMP, calcium, and calmodulin which are involved in signaling
              in higher plants.  %%%  This project will identify mechanisms by which
              components within cells interact in response to a stimulus such as exposure to
              light.  ***
