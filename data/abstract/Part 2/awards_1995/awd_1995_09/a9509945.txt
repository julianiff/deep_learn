Abstract    :
              9509945  White  Density matrix renormalization group calculations will be  done
              on a number of quasi-one-dimensional systems.  The  density function
              renormalization group technique is a new  numerical method to obtain accurate
              results for single-chain  magnetic and electronic systems.  The technique was 
              developed by the principal investigator.  The tecnique can  be extended to
              quasi-low-dimensional systems by coupling  single chains.  Algorithms for this
              new computational method  will be developed to improve efficiency and to enable
              study  of systems with greater width.  The focus will be on coupled  Heisenberg
              and Hubbard chains.  %%%  The primarily computational research will both
              improve an  exciting new algorithm and apply it to model systems which  are
              thought to describe real materials of current interest,  e.g., high temperature
              superconductors.  ***
