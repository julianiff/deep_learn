Abstract    :
              9509597  Stanford  Grizzly Bear Digging in Subalpine Meadows: Influences on
              Plant Distributions and Nitrogen Availability  Grizzly bears are omnivores who
              often feed intensively on bulbs of plants such as glacier lilies. Foraging by
              bears can overturn large tracts of subalpine meadows. Ppeliminary observations
              suggest that this activity may increase nitrogen availability, seed production,
              bulb nitrogen, and bulb carbohydrate content. As such, these large animals may
              play major roles in the structure and function of subalpine plant communities.
              This project will rigorously test this hypothesis in areas inside and adjacent
              to Rocky Mountain National Park in Montana. This research will consider the
              role of a large omnivorous animal on the ecosystems in which they reside.
