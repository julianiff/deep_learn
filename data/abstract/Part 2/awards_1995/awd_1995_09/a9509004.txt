Abstract    :
              9509004  Leibold  A wide variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
              ways by which energy flow regulates the biodiversity of ecological communities.
              However, there has been relatively little experimental work aimed at
              discriminating among these competing hypotheses. These investigators will
              conduct direct experimental tests of the most plausible hypotheses relating
              eutrophication to biodiversity in aquatic communities. These experiments will
              be conducted in a series of mesocosms which provide three important advantages:
              (1) both nutrient loading and trophic structure can be independently
              manipulated, (2) other potentially confounding factors can be controlled, and
              (3) the expected biological responses can be easily measured and evaluated.
              Additional, experimental enclosures will be established in ponds to test these
              hypotheses under more natural conditions. Finally, extensive analyses of
              controls on biodiversity in natural ponds will be conducted, as well.   The
              results of this study will confirm or reject four competing hypotheses that are
              believed to explain patterns of biodiversity in natural systems. Moreover, the
              research will assess the relative importance of "bottom-up" versus "top-down"
              factors in the regulation of plankton diversity. This knowledge is particularly
              important if future environmental policies directed at the protection of
              biodiversity are to be based on valid scientific premises. Finally, this work
              will provide an increased understanding of the potentially detrimental effects
              of eutrophication on biodiversity in natural wetland communities.
