Abstract    :
              9509877  Iwan  This  award  is  for  the renewal of the Caltech  Branch  of  the
               National  Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE).  The  other 
              branch  of  NISEE is located  at  the  University  of  California,  Berkeley. 
              The purpose of the Caltech Branch  is  to  make  a  major  contribution to the
              dissemination of  information  relevant   to   earthquake  engineering  and 
              earthquake   hazard  mitigation  throughout the nation.  The special
              contributions  of  the  Caltech activity will be to provide unique resource
              material  through  its library and other means, provide leadership  in  the 
              area  of strong-motion data distribution and analysis, and assist  in 
              introducing innovative new technology like the Worldwide  Web  into  the 
              operations  of the earthquake engineering  information  system.  ***
