Abstract    :
              9509237  Turchin    Reaction-diffusion theory has been employed in several
              branches of biology in order to understand and model formation of spatial
              patterns.  Among ecologists there is currently a wide appreciation of the
              importance of spatial heterogeneity, and it has been theorized that
              reaction-diffusion theory provides a common mechanisms by which such patchiness
              arises.  However, this theoretical explanation has not been empirically tested.
               Reaction-diffusion theory will be tested in the ecological system consisting
              of southern pine beetles (SPB), pine trees that are attacked by SPB, and SPB
              predators.  This system is characterized by an extremely patchy pattern of SPB
              attack; in some areas, called 'SPB spots', all trees are killed, while outside
              spots very few trees are killed.  Reaction-diffusion theory suggests that the
              discontinuous pattern of SPB attack is due, at least partly, to the effect of
              predators disproportionately killing SPB just outside the spot boundaries. 
              This project will combine modeling with experimental studies.  Field studies
              will be used to measure the parameters of the model, and to test the model
              predictions.  The strongest test of the theory will consist of adding predators
              to existing SPB spots.    Although the primary thrust of this research is
              basic, it will also yield information highly relevant to applied aspects of
              ecology, such as the effects of spatial heterogeneity and fragmentation on
              biological conservation and pest control.  Moreover, if predators are found to
              play an important role in preventing spread of SPB spots, this will provide a
              very useful tool for biological control of SPB, the most destructive pest of
              southern pines.
