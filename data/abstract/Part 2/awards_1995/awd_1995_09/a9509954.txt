Abstract    :
              9509954  Pazzaglia    NSF funding will supplement matching funds from the
              University of  New Mexico to build and implement a UNIX-based computational 
              facility within the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.  Specifically,
              a Sun SPARCstation 20 workstation with 64 MB of  memory, 10 GB of mass storage,
              a large-format color monitor with  a graphics accelerator card, a CD-ROM and
              software including, Sun  Solaris operating system, FORTRAN-90 and C compilers,
              ARC/INFO  and S-PLUS will be acquired. An extant department-wide network 
              serviced by DEC-PATHWORKS will enable all faculty, research  staff, and
              students to access the new facility with the option to  have their PC or
              Macintosh run X-applications through the  SPARCstation 20 workstation.  The
              facility will be designed  primarily to meet the research needs of the
              Quaternary Studies  Group in acquiring, processing, analyzing, and displaying
              large  digital data sets, but will also have an interdisciplinary focus  in
              enhancing UNIX-based resources and applications for the  Department.  Research
              to be performed by Quaternary Studies Group  at this facility will include
              manipulation of high-resolution (30  and 90 m) USGS digital elevation data to
              perform (1) regional  quantitative morphometric analysis, (2) investigate the 
              fundamental relationship between uplift, relief, mean elevation,  and erosion,
              (3) perform computationally-intensive Fourier  analyses on topography to
              extract the tectonic component in  landscape development, (4) provide a
              framework for the  preparation and compilation of surficial geologic maps, and
              (5)  use topographic data and surficial geologic data in concert with 
              GIS-based applications in landscape evolution analyses.    ***
