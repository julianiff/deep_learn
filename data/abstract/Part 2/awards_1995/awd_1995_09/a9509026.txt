Abstract    :
                  9509026  HUBBELL   A long-term study of a 50 ha permanent plot of
              neotropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panama, has revealed that
              individual pioneer species are absent from many potentially suitable gap sites.
               Although pioneer species are not expected to be common in a forest where
              suitable sites are rare, they appear to be less common than would be expected
              by chance.  This research will test the hypothesis that distribution and
              abundance of pioneer species in the BCI forest are primarily controlled by
              dispersal limitation rather than by germination and establishment limitation. 
              All canopy gaps greater than 25 m2 will be mapped on the 50 ha plot.  A series
              of field experiments in gaps will be conducted to determine if the
              environmental conditions in gaps and closed forest affect germination and
              establishment.  Seed fall will also be monitored as a measure of dispersal
              limitation.   The potential importance of dispersal limitation goes far beyond
              finding explanations for distribution and abundance.  Recent theoretical work
              has shown that strong dispersal limitation can promote tree species richness by
              greatly slowing competitive exclusion.  In addition, this work will provide
              important insights into mechanisms that maintain species diversity in
              neotropical forest communities that are rapidly disappearing due to
              deforestation.
