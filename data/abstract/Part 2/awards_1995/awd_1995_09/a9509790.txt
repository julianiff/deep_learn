Abstract    :
                 9509790 Boland  This research project aims for fundamental understanding of
              the chemistry of low temperature chemical vapor deposition(CVD), with emphasis
              on the role of hydrogen in silicon CVD.  The application of variable
              temperature scanning tunneling microscope (VT-STM) and inherent atom-resolved
              capabilities of STM with different operation and temperature ranges will
              provide access to real-time dynamics on the growth surface.  Basic mechanisms
              of silicon-hydrogen surface chemistry and its role in promoting low temperature
              growth as well as the activities of hydrogen atoms in controlling surface
              diffusion and related processes at reduced temperatures to enhance epitaxy will
              be studied. %%% The primary goal of this research project is to establish
              greater basic understanding of particular phenomena critical to thin film
              synthesis and processing of electronic materials, and to relate this
              understanding to the development of advanced microelectronics devices through
              modifications in processing methods. Additionally, an important feature of the
              program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. The knowledge and
              understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute
              generally to improving the performance of advanced devices used in computing,
              information processing, and telecommunications. ***
