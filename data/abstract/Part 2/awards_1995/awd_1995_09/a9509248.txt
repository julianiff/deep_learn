Abstract    :
              9509248  Smith    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund a planning visit by 
              Dr. Ross W. Smith of the University of Nevada, Reno, to go  to Brazil to visit
              Dr. Jorge Rubio of Federal University of  Rio Grando do Sul.  They will develop
              a collaboration on the  removal of contaminant toxic cations and anions found
              in  waters of both the U.S. and Brazil by using aquatic plants,  and study the
              use of the microbubble flotation technique to  remove toxic solids from
              contaminated waters and soils.          ***
