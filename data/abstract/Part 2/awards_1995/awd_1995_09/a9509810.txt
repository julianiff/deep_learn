Abstract    :
                Detwiler/Abstract  ATM-9509810             The objectives of this research are
              to characterize in detail  hydrometeor development and the co-evolution of
              storm circulations,  cloud and precipitation particle populations, and electric
              fields  in Florida thunderstorms.         Aircraft, radar, satellite,
              radiosonde, and surface  observations of thunder storms from the Convection and
               Precipitation/Electricity (CaPE) project will be used.  This  project was
              conducted near the Kennedy Space Center during the  summer of 1991.  Results
              from three CaPE case studies completed  under prior funding have shown that
              ice-phase precipitation, along  with upper-level downdrafts, develop prior to
              the first indications  of storm electrification.  Negative electric charge is
              co-located  with areas of precipitation at mid-levels in these storms in their 
              early to mature phases, although the charge carriers were not  identified.     
                 Data from more than a dozen additional research flights is  available to
              refine and generalize preliminary conclusions reached  in these three completed
              studies.  These data will be composited to  yield a more general picture of
              evolution in Florida thunderstorms.   In collaboration with other workers,
              interpretation of multi-  parameter radar signatures will be refined using
              intercomparisons  with in situ aircraft microphysical measurements.  Further
              analysis  of airborne electric field and airframe discharge data will be 
              undertaken to reduce uncertainties in electric field retrievals  from in situ
              airborne measurements.
