Abstract    :
              Congaltonl   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
              Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this
              project is designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking
              scientists and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate
              goal of better understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take
              place within it. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is designed to integrate
              reference data collection by K-12 students and accuracy assessment of land
              cover maps derived from remotely sensed data into the GLOBE initiative. The
              specific objectives of this work are: 1. To develop and implement a protocol
              for enabling student-collected reference data to assess the accuracy of
              remotely sensed information. 2. To incorporate the reference data for accuracy
              assessment in support of other GLOBE investigators and for other regional and
              national mapping efforts to be identified early on in this effort. The use of
              GPS equipment for locating ground points will be coordinated with the P.I. for
              GPS. The goal of the project will be to focus the reference data collection to
              appropriate projects and produce a show-case result early on. In addition to
              protocol design, extensive training and support materials will be developed for
              the students and teachers working with this effort.
