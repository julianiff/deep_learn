Abstract    :
              DMS-950993              CUNY-Baruch - Arthur Apter    The Mid Atlantic
              Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS)  was formed in 1982.   Since then it has
              been supporting three or four regional meetings in logic per year,   each of
              1-2 days' length.  The hosting of the meetings is shared among   several 
              institutions, with additional support for the seminar from the host  
              institution in most cases. The  topics cover a broad spectrum of topics from  
              mathematical logic, with program constructed by the host organizers.    NSF  
              support is provided for some of the expenses of the speakers and the  
              attendees from the region, in particular of the graduate students who attend.
