Abstract    :
              9509624  Rigney  The tribological behavior of aluminum alloys containing hard 
              and/or soft components will be studied.  The purpose is to  develop guidelines
              for the design of bearing materials for  use in sliding applications, such as
              automotive uses, with  the hope that the results will allow the gradual
              phase-out  of lead in these  materials.  The work is primarily  experimental
              and involves tribological testing and post-test  characterization of Al-Pb,
              Al-Si, Al-Pb-Si alloys as well as  more complex compositions with closely
              controlled size and  distribution of the secondary phase.  The work includes a 
              collaboration with the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute  of Solid State
              Physics in Chernigolovka.  That institute has  developed a technique based on
              the use of magnetic and  electric fields for producing very fine
              microstructures in  bulk materials of immiscible components, such as Al-Pb and 
              Al-graphite and will provide the various alloys for testing.  ***
