Abstract    :
                      Many  government and commercial organizations  possess  extremely  large
               databases, with sizes  often  measured  in  terabytes,  containing such
              information  as  consumer  data,  astronomical  observations, biological
              sequences,  etc.  The  extraction  of  information from such  large  databases 
              has  become known as database mining and is an area where machine  learning 
              techniques must meet performance  requirements  of  very  large database
              systems. This research focuses  on  one  particular  database-mining  task, 
              the  problem   of   rule  discovery.  Rule  discovery  is  viewed  as  an 
              interactive  process  with  a  human in the loop , an  iterative  process 
              where  the  user is not only trying to discover  interesting  results, but also
              interesting questions to ask. The approach  is based on the key idea that rules
              can themselves be viewed  as  objects.  Under  this view the space of  possible
               rules  supported by a database can itself be treated as a database,  and  the 
              rule-discovery  process can  be  approached  as  a  process of querying the
              rule base implicitly defined by each  database. The human in the loop user of
              the discovery system  would interact with  the system via ad hoc rulebase
              queries,  designing the desired query interactively as various results  are 
              returned during a rule discovery session. The  proposed  implementation of the
              data mining system is  tested  on  the  data from the health-care field,
              obtained through an ongoing  collaboration with a major provider of managed
              health care.
