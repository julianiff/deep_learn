Abstract    :
              9509718   This proposal is to formulate an evaluation for the Global Learning
              and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program.  The project calls
              for the design, structuring, and coordination of a new kind of evaluation - one
              in which the evaluation staff, program officers, project staffs, and
              participating classrooms work  cooperatively to provide the kinds of
              information that can support improvement of their activities and answer the
              questions of founders and policy-makers.   Surveys will be designed to seek the
              impact of GLOBE on attitudes (toward science and the earth), skills, and
              knowledge of both students and teachers.  Questions are to address different
              grade levels, schools with different kinds of network connections, in more- and
              less- industrialized settings, in English-speaking and non-English speaking
              classes and to address these issues in multi-part, on line student and teacher
              surveys.  The evaluation design has both formative and summative aspects and
              seeks to provide information about a wide range of outcomes for students,
              teachers, and the scientific community.  The documentation and evaluation role
              is a working partnership with the various GLOBE constituencies to support the
              activities of the program.
