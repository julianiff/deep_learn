Abstract    :
              9509879  BLEDSOE  Belowground Dynamics in a California Blue Oak Woodland:
              Production, Mortality and Decomposition of Oak and Grass Roots  Roots acquire
              nutrients and water for plants, as well as providing structural support. Roots
              also grow, die, and decompose, making them part of ecosystem carbon and
              nutrient cycles. Although roots have very important ecosystem functions, their
              belowground location makes them difficult to study. Consequently, less data
              exist for roots than other parts of plants. This research project focuses on
              root dynamics and asks these questions:  (1) How does fine roots growth, death,
              and decomposition vary spatially and seasonally? (2) Do oaks and grasses
              coexist with limited competition or do they compete for water and nutrients,
              especially during annual summer drought? These questions will be answered by
              measuring seasonal soil water and temperature, soil respiration, and root
              dynamics. Oak mycorrhizae, a beneficial partnership between certain fungi and
              plant roots, will be studied. Because blue oaks and annual grasses have
              different types of mycorrhizae, the research also will examine whether
              mycorrhizal types affect how well the plants take up water and nutrients. This
              research will help further maintenance of California's blue oak woodlands and
              understanding how mycorrhizae alter plant competition.
