Abstract    :
              Postawko          In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
              Learning and  Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this
              project is designed to meet  the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking
              scientists and schoolchildren in a global  information network with the
              ultimate goal of better understanding the Earth's environment  and   changes
              that take place within it. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is planning to use 
              GLOBE data in an on-going research program of verification of satellite
              derived-quantities  using surface observations. Measurements to be verified
              include cloud observations,  temperature, moisture, solar radiation, wind speed
              and wind direction. A secondary, but   very important, component of the
              proposed research program is to utilize GLOBE data to  investigate changes in
              the global hydrological cycle. GLOBE'S contribution to this project  will be to
              provide important data over a number of years in data sparse regions of the 
              world. Because satellites are the environmental tools of the future it is
              important  that students know how they work, and participate in improving the
              use of satellite data.
