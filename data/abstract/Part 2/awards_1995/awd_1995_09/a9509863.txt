Abstract    :
                      9509863  Bleil    The primary interest of Dr. Bleil's laboratory is
              analysis of  mammalian fertilization at the molecular level, combining 
              techniques of cell biology, biochemistry and molecular genetics. He  has
              identified a mouse sperm protein, a lectin called sp56, which  has many
              properties expected of the protein responsible for sperm  recognition of the
              mouse egg's zona pellucida. He has recently  isolated and cloned the cDNA
              encoding sp56. Amino acid sequence  derived from this cDNA indicates that: 1)
              the protein is translated  on the endoplasmic reticulum, 2) has no
              transmembrane domain, and  3) is a member of a superfamily of extracellular
              protein receptors.  Probes directed against sp56 and its mRNA reveal that
              transcription  of the sp56 gene and translation of its mRNA occur exclusively
              in  spermatogenic cells of the mouse. The long term goals to be  addressed by
              studies described here are: 1) to genetically prove or  disprove the hypothesis
              that sp56 is the sperm protein which  recognizes the mouse egg zona pellucida,
              mediating sperm binding to  the egg's zona pellucida, and 2) to determine the
              molecular  structure of the sp56/ZP3 complex. In order to attain these goals, 
              the gene encoding sp56 must be identified and isolated. The  specific aims of
              the proposed study are as follows: 1) To use cDNA  encoding sp56, currently
              available in this laboratory, to screen a  mouse genomic library. Genomic DNA
              clones, including sequence  upstream of the translated region, will be purified
              and sequenced;  2) To analyze the sequence of the sp56 gene in order to
              identify  regulatory sequences which might encode specific expression in 
              testes. Comparison with other, previously identified genes which  are expressed
              in testes may reveal common regulatory sequences.  ***
