Abstract    :
              9509875  Bergmann    This  project  is concerned with the magnetic properties 
              of  nd-  atoms on the surface of noble metals or simple (s,p) metals.  The 
              complementary  transport  methods of weak  localization  and  the  anomalous 
              Hall  effect are employed. These  methods  detect  the  magnetic  interaction 
              between the magnetic  impurity  atoms  and  bulk/surface   conduction 
              electrons.   The   weak   localization  technique  allows the detection of less
              that 10-4 of a  monolayer  of  surface atoms, and is by a factor of 100 more
              sensitive  than  alternative   detection  methods.  The  anomalous   Hall  
              effect  measurements  help  to determine the character  of  the  magnetic 
              atom,  ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This project addresses  both
              experimental and theoretical aspects of the coupling between  magnetic 
              impurity atoms and conduction electrons. Sub-monolayers  of  3d  atoms,  as 
              well as 4d and 5d atoms  such  as  zirconium,  molybdenum,  technetium, and
              ruthenium on metals such  as  silver  and  gold  will  be investigated. The
              results are of  fundamental  interest,  but  also have potential applications
              to technological  areas such as the microelectronics industry.  %%%  The study
              of magnetism in thin films and on surfaces belongs to a  very   active   area  
              of   materials  research   with   numerous  opportunities  to have an impact on
              technology such  as  magnetic  recording  devises. Individual magnetic atoms
              form  the  simplest  building  blocks  on  magnetic  structure.  Such  atoms 
              will  be  investigated in this study using very sensitive techniques. On of 
              these  can detect less than one ten-thousandth of a single  layer  of  magnetic
               atoms  which are deposited on  a  metallic  surface  another  technique is
              able to distinguish the  direction  of  the  individual   magnetic  moments  of
               the  deposited   atoms.   The  experiments also probe to what extent the
              magnetic properties  of  surfaces differ from those of the bulk.  ***
