Abstract    :
              Abstract  FARNET, Inc.  NCR-9509138  PI:  Jim Williams    FARNET proposes a
              three-year project to design, develop and deploy an on-line  guide to
              telecommunications infrastructure, Internet penetration and strategic 
              directions for each of the United States.  No comprehensive resource exists
              which  describes state networking infrastructure, current capabilities and
              strategic intentions.   FARNET will proposes to collect information from each
              of the states, organize the  information and provide gopher and world-wide web
              servers to the Internet  community.  FARNET will be responsible for the
              collection and organization of the  data, they propose that the InterNIC
              Database and Directory Services (AT&T) be the  repository of the collected
              information.    The document will have value when initially produced, the
              nature of networking in  the United States is one of change.  The document will
              have to be maintained and  updated as State infrastructure or intentions
              change, it will be of even greater value.   The 3 year project will terminate
              with an information resource that will be self  sustaining with information
              maintained by each of the states.
