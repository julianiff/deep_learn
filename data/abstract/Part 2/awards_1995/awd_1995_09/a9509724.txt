Abstract    :
              Rodier   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning
              and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.
              This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is concerned with measurements of Ultra Violet
              (UV) radiation using a photochemical dosimeter. The UV data collected by
              students in individual schools will be shared with other schools through a
              network called "ULTRA-NET", interpreted by high school students and the
              Principal Investigator and made available to all students on the Internet. UV
              radiation has important biological effects and an increase in UV radiation at
              the surface of the Antarctic continent for example has been tied to the
              diminution of the earth's protective ozone layer by man-made chemical
              compounds.
