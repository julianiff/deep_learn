              Economic Issues for Electronic Commerce    This research is to study issues of
              electronic commerce,  focusing on electronic data interchange, advertising, 
              and virtual stores.  The main objective is to provide a  general approach to
              manage and analyze the potential  economy consisting of users of the network
              services and  the service providers, leading to an implementable  pricing tool
              for communications networks.  The first  phase will enhance the existing
              simulation models by  developing additional mechanisms for providing better 
              predictions of waiting times.  These additional  mechanisms include: (1)
              approximating queuing mechanisms  for computing prices, (2) developing
              guidelines to set  parameters automatically, (3) adding functionality to 
              simulation subroutines, (4) automating some sampling  subroutines, (5)
              performing testing, (6) developing  computing tools for the pricing scheme. 
              The second  phase will implement pricing mechanism on LANs and  building a
              simple user interface with the ability to  query, optimize costs, and present
              results in an  appropriate format. At the server level, software agents  will
              be developed to respond to user queries and perform  estimation and pricing
              calculations. The third and final  phase of the project intends to develop the
              complete  final priority pricing mechanism for the Wide Area  Network
              environments.
