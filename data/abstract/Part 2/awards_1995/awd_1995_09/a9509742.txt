Abstract    :
              9509742  Hilbish        The dynamics of hybrid zones consist of two major
              elements; the dispersal of parent species and their hybrids into and out of the
              zone, and their differential survival and reproduction. Strong selection
              operates within hybrid populations of marine mussels species capable of
              large-scale dispersal. The objectives of the work proposed here is two-fold. 
              First, the hypothesis that selection in the hybrid zone is determined by the
              environment will be tested and potential selective agents identified.  Second,
              the patterns of larval dispersal across a portion of the hybrid zone will be
              described.  This will serve to identify the geographic and genetic origin of
              larvae that immigrate to hybrid populations and are subsequently subjected to
              selection.   Four hypotheses will be examined to understand the role of
              specific environmental factors in selection among hybrid genotypes.  These
              studies will determine the coincidence of each environmental stress with onset
              and duration of natural selection.  These studies will provide the basis for
              specific laboratory and field-experimental tests of potential selective agents
              in future studies.  Second, molecular genetic techniques, developed with
              previous NSF support, will be used to determine the origin of larval
              populations that recruit into hybrid populations.  This information will
              provide a foundation upon which to interpret the patterns of selection observed
              within hybrid populations and potentially the fate of hybrid larvae once they
              disperse out of the hybrid zone back into one of the parental populations.
