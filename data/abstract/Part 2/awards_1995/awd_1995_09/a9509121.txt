Abstract    :
              9509121  Porter   The important role that animal pollinators like insects play
              in the origin of morphological diversity in flowering plants is generally
              appreciated.  However, we still know little about the actual sequence of events
              associated with evolutionary change from one pollination syndrome (for example,
              by bird, bat, bee, or moth) to another.  Through analysis of the historical,
              genealogical sequence of speciation events in a group of plants with well-known
              pollination syndromes, we should be able to reconstruct in detail the
              evolutionary path to new pollination mechanisms.   Dr. J. Mark Porter, a
              specialist in molecular systematics, and Dr. Dieter Wilken, a specialist in
              plant morphology and taxonomy, are working together to determine the phylogeny
              of the species of the phlox family, Polemoniaceae.  About 120 species will be
              studied, as representative of the floral and pollinator diversity in the
              family, for both DNA and morphological characteristics.  DNA analyses will be
              conducted on nuclear ribosomal sequences and on chloroplast genes.  Congruent
              patterns of species divergence that are revealed by both molecular and
              morphological analysis constitute robust hypotheses of phylogenetic
              relationship.  This genealogical framework in turn provides a road map to the
              sequence of changes in floral shape, size, and phenology associated with the
              ecological shifts in pollinators through the course of evolution in these
              plants.
