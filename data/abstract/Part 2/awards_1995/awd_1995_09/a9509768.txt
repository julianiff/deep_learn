Abstract    :
              9509768  Kriz       This NSF Young Investigator Award will provide partial
              support  for Igor Kriz's research on homotopy groups and generalized 
              cohomology theories and on homotopical commutative algebra.  The  work involves
              both theory and computation of importance to the  foundations of algebraic
              topology.  ***
