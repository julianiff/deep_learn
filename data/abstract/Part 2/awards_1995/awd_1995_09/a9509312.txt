Abstract    :
              9509312  Cole   Throughout western North America the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex
              occidentalis, is one of the dominant animal species; it is an important
              component of the desert landscape.  The goal of the current research is to
              determine how the density and distribution of these organisms are regulated.
              Two possible mechanisms influence population density:  the availability of
              recruits and the availability of food and space for the colonies.  These two
              need not be mutually exclusive.  Both the availability of food and space and
              the numbers of recruits will be experimentally modified to measure the effect
              on population density.     The experimental studies on the regulation of
              population density and colony distribution will be combined with measurement of
              temporal and spatial variation in the patterns of recruitment to extend the
              understanding of local processes to large geographical scales.  Pogonomyrmex
              occidentalis is the primary disperser of seeds in a fragile ecosystem subject
              to multiple uses.  By determining the factors that govern the population size
              and distribution in this important species, this research may elucidate the
              mechanisms that govern range quality and habitat preservation.
