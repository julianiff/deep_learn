Abstract    :
              9509754  Ill. Inst. / Tech.  ABSTRACT           When polymers are heated during
              flow, the distortion of the molecular chains by the shearing forces in the flow
              cause changes in the properties of the thermal properties of the polymer. For
              example, the thermal conductivity in a direction normal to the wall will be
              different than along the wall. The proposal is to carry out combined
              experimental and numerical modeling investigations of coupled heat and mass
              transfer in the flows of polymers, taking into consideration the effect of
              shear flows on the properties. Applications are to prediction of thermal
              effects during polymer processing, with the goal of allowing better design of
              polymer processing equipment..
